## Mistakes, spelling errors, etc

Before you attempt to edit, make sure you have grasped the context. Sometimes, the
author delibrately uses such errors for demonstration purposes.

## British vs. American English spelling

Depending on the material's origin, it may be in either British or American English
spelling. Regardless of your personal preferences, please refrain from changing the
spelling from British to American (or vice versa).

For other types of files that are not related to the material (e.g. this file), use
American English spelling.

## Opening an issue

to the Docusaurus project page and open an issue there instead.

Only open an issue if you believe the bug originates from the ``src`` folder.
Ensure the issue is "brand new" (use the search function). Be sure to write
detailed descriptions and steps to reproduce the bugs.
