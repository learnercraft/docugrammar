## Mistakes, spelling errors, etc

Before you attempt to edit, make sure you have grasped the context. Sometimes, the
author delibrately uses such errors for demonstration purposes.

If you believe there is indeed error, please use the "Edit this page" link at the bottom of each article.

Please do not make changes to many files in a single pull request, as that will make it hard to review.

## British vs. American English spelling

Depending on the material's origin, it may be in either British or American English
spelling. Regardless of your personal preferences, please refrain from changing the
spelling from British to American (or vice versa).

For other types of files that are not related to the material (e.g. this file), use
American English spelling.

## Opening an issue

Most of the time, bugs may come from Docusaurus itself. If that happens, please go
to the Docusaurus project page and open an issue there instead.

Only open an issue if you believe the bug originates from the ``src`` folder.
Ensure the issue is "brand new" (use the search function). Be sure to write
detailed descriptions and steps to reproduce the bugs.

You can also open an issue to make a feature request. You should provide a practical use/example why the requested feature is needed or nice-to-have.

We reserve the rights to close issues that are unclear in nature or not possible to reproduce (excluding in some circumstances where they are not reproducible but catch our interest).

## Making a pull request

When making a pull request, please ensure that your changes are relevant to the issue or feature you are addressing. Specifically:

- Keep changes scoped: Only modify files that are directly related to the issue or feature you are working on. Avoid including changes to unrelated files or parts of the project. Example: in a single pull request, you are fixing this bug in the ``X.js`` file, but you make changes to the ``./docs/Y.md`` file because you have found a typo there.
- Separate concerns: If you need to make changes to unrelated parts of the project, please do so in separate pull requests. This helps keep the review process focused and efficient.
- Clear commit messages: Ensure your commit messages clearly describe the changes made and reference the related issue or feature.

By following these guidelines, you help maintain the project's clarity and ease of maintenance. Thank you for your contributions.
