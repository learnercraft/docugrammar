# Adjective phrases

An adjective phrase always has an adjective acting as the head. The adjective phrase may also contain words or phrases before or after the head (modifiers and complements):

Adjective (head):

- *That’s a **lovely** cake.*
- *These flowers are **wonderful**.*

Adjective preceded by a modifier (underlined):

- *That soup is* pretty ***cold****.*
- *Many of the exercises are* fairly ***difficult****.*

Adjective + a modifier after it:

- *The food was* ***tasty*** enough*.*
- *The car is* ***economical*** for its size*.*

Adjective + a word or phrase which is required to complete its meaning (a complement):

- *She was* ***aware*** of the danger of travelling alone*.*
- *Some people weren’t* ***willing*** to pay extra to book a seat on the plane*.*

Adjective preceded by a modifier + a word or phrase which is required to complete its meaning (a complement):

- *We’re not* very ***keen*** on having an activity holiday*.*
- *Are you* really ***interested*** in rock and roll?

Some adjective phrases have more complex structures.
