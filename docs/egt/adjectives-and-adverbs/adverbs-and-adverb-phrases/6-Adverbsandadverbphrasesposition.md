# Adverbs and adverb phrases: position

We can put adverbs and adverb phrases at the front, in the middle or at the end of a clause.

The front position of the clause is the first item in the clause:

- ***Suddenly*** *I felt afraid.*
- ***Yesterday*** *detectives arrested a man and a woman in connection with the murder.*

The end position of the clause is the last item in the clause:

- *Why do you always have to eat **so fast**?*

The mid position is between the subject and the main verb:

- *Apples **always** taste best when you pick them straight off the tree.*

Where there is more than one verb, mid position means after the first auxiliary verb or after a modal verb:

- *The government has **occasionally** been forced to change its mind.* (after the first auxiliary verb)
- *You can **definitely never** predict what will happen.* (after a modal verb)
- *We mightn’t **ever** have met.* (after the modal verb and before the auxiliary verb)

In questions, mid position is between the subject and the main verb:

- *Do you **ever** think about living there?*

Adverbs usually come after the main verb *be*, except in emphatic clauses:

- *She**’s always** late for everything.*

When *be* is emphasised, the adverb comes before the verb:

- *Why should I have gone to see Madonna? I **never was** a fan of hers.* (emphatic)

## Types of adverbs and their positions

Different types of adverbs go in different places.

## Manner, place and time

Adverbs of manner, place and time usually come in end position:

- *He played **brilliantly**.*

If the verb has an object, the adverb comes after the object:

- *We \[verb\] made \[object\] a decision \[adverb\] **quickly** then left.*

When there is more than one of the three types of adverb together, they usually go in the order: manner, place, time:

- *You start off \[manner\] **slowly** \[time\] **in the beginning**.*
- Not: You start off in the beginning slowly~~.~~
- *James played \[manner\] **brilliantly** \[place\] **in the match on** \[time\] **Saturday**.* (preferred to *James played brilliantly on Saturday in the match*.)

:::warning

We don’t put adverbs between the verb and the object:

- *She \[verb\] plays \[object\] the piano \[adverb\] **really well**. I’ve heard her.*
- Not: *~~She plays really well the piano~~*.

- *I don’t watch the TV **very often**.*

## Evaluative and viewpoint

Adverbs indicating the attitude and point of view of the speaker or writer usually go at the beginning. These adverbs are called sentence adverbs because they refer to the whole sentence or utterance:

- ***Actually****, I think the meeting is on Wednesday, not Thursday.*
- ***Obviously****, we can’t tell you the result but we can give you an indication.*

## Position with here and there

:::warning

If the subject is a pronoun (*it/he/she/you* etc.), it comes directly after the adverbs *here* and *there*. If the subject is a noun, it comes directly after the verb:

- ***Here*** *she is.*
- Not: *~~Here is she.~~*
- ***There*** *it goes.*
- Not: *~~There goes it.~~*
- ***Here*** *comes the bus.*
- Not: *~~Here the bus comes.~~*
