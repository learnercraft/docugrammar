# Pretty

We can use *pretty* as an adverb, before an adjective or another adverb, meaning ‘quite, but not extremely’. It is informal:

- *I’m **pretty sure** we’ve met before. Were you at Clare Harding’s wedding?*
- *You need to get there **pretty early** to get a good seat.*

*Pretty well* as a modifier means ‘almost’:

- *That’s **pretty well** all we need to do this morning, so why don’t we break for lunch?*

:::warning

We don’t use *pretty* in more formal situations. We use *quite* or *fairly*:

- \[in a job application letter\]
- *At present I am employed at a branch of the National Bank in a **fairly large** city.*
- Not: … ~~in a pretty large city.~~

:::

*Pretty* does not mean the same as *very*:

- *It was **very** kind of you to lend us your car when we stayed with you.*
- Not: *~~It was pretty kind of you~~* …

We don’t use *pretty* in negative sentences:

- *The restaurant wasn’t **very** good, really. I don’t think we’ll go there again.* (or *The restaurant wasn’t **so** good …*)
- Not: … ~~wasn’t pretty good~~ …
