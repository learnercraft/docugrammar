# Really

We use the adverb *really* when we want to emphasise something:

- *That pasta was **really** delicious. Thank you.*
- *I **really** like those photographs. Can we see them on the computer?*
- *Emigrating to Canada was a **really** big decision for the whole family.*

We also use *really* to question whether what someone says is true:

- *They don’t look pleased to me. Are they **really** pleased?*
- *Is that **really** her sister? They don’t look at all alike.*

We can use *really* to make a negative utterance less direct:

- *I’m not **really** angry, but I wanted them to think about their behaviour.*
- A: *What do you think she should say to him?*
- B: *I don’t know*, ***really***.

We can use *really* as a short response when we show interest or surprise:

- A: *They’re going on a cycling holiday to France*.
- B: ***Really****?*
- A: *Yes, and they’re going to the Alps!*
