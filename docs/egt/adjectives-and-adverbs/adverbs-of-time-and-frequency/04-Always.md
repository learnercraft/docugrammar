# Always

*Always* is an adverb.

## Always: meaning

*Always* can mean ‘on every occasion’, ‘forever’ or ‘very frequently’. In these meanings we use it with simple tense forms:

- *She **always** brings me flowers when she comes to visit.*
- *I will **always** love you.*
- *Kenneth has **always** been called Kenny by his family.*

## Always with continuous verb forms

We can use *always* with continuous verb forms to refer to regular events or states, especially ones which are problematic or which we do not like or want:

- *She’s **always complaining** about her job. Why doesn’t she get a new one?*
- *Teenagers were **always causing** trouble at the shopping centre, stealing things, breaking windows, that sort of thing.*
- *The kids are **always asking** for sweets, but they’re not good for them.*

## Always: position

We most commonly use *always* in mid position, between the subject and main verb, after the modal verb or first auxiliary verb, or after main verb *be*:

- ***He always wears*** *a hat.* (between subject and main verb)
- *I’**ve always wanted** an open-top sports car.* (after first auxiliary verb)
- *I envy you. You**’ll always** be happy!* (after the modal verb)
- *She’**s always** late for class.* (after main verb *be*)

We don’t use *always* at the beginning of a statement or question:

- *She **always** cooks wonderful meals.*
- Not: *~~Always she cooks wonderful meals~~*.
- *Do you **always** go camping for your summer holidays?*
- Not: *~~Always do you go camping~~* …

## Always with can and could

We often use *always* with *can* and *could* to talk about possible solutions to problems:

- *If the hotels are all full, you **can always** stay with us.*
- *If I needed it, I **could always** borrow money from my father.*

## As always

We use *as always* to talk about one event which is seen as typical:

- ***As always****, she made us feel very welcome in her home.*
- \[at the end of an email, thanking someone for a visit\]
- *It was nice, **as always**, to see you last week.*

## Always, for good or for ever?

When we talk about things which will be permanent, we normally use *for good*, or, more formally, *for ever* (sometimes written as *forever*). We do not normally say *for always*:

- *She just wants to work in Australia for a year. She doesn’t want to move there **for good**.*
- *I will remember this moment **for ever**.* (more formal)

## Always or all the time?

*All the time* also means ‘very often’ or ‘continually’ and is commonly used to refer to things that people do not like or do not want to happen. We don’t use *all the time* in mid position:

- *My guitar tutor criticises me **all the time**. She thinks I’m lazy.*
- Not: *~~My guitar tutor all the time criticises me.~~*
- *We have this kind of problem **all the time**.*

We don’t use *all the time* before a command (imperative):

- ***Always*** *take extra care when driving near a school.*
- Not: *~~All the time take extra care~~* …
