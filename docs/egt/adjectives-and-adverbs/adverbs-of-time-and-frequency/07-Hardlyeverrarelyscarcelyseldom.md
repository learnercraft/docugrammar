# Hardly ever, rarely, scarcely, seldom

## Frequency adverbs meaning ‘not very often’

*Hardly ever*, *rarely*, *scarcely* and *seldom* are frequency adverbs. We can use them to refer to things that almost never happen, or do not happen very often. They have a negative meaning. We use them without *not*. *Rarely*, *scarcely* and *seldom* are more common in writing than in speaking:

- *He **hardly ever** smiles.*
- *Providing fresh trout for dinner was **rarely** a problem.* \[a trout is a type of fish\]
- *She **scarcely** saw her grandchildren.*
- *Griffin, the physics teacher, **seldom** shouted.*

## Hardly and scarcely meaning ‘almost not at all’

*Hardly* and *scarcely* can mean ‘almost not at all’ or ‘only just’. *Hardly* is much more common than *scarcely*, and *scarcely* is more formal:

- *Jen was so tired. She could **scarcely** keep her eyes open.*
- *I **hardly** know them. I’ve only met them once.*

## Word order

We usually put these adverbs in mid position, between the subject and main verb, after the modal verb or first auxiliary verb, or after main verb *be*. In more formal styles, we put them in front position and invert the subject and verb. If there is no auxiliary or modal verb, we use *do/does/did*.

- *Often*
- *Sometimes* or *sometime*?
- *Never* or *not … ever*?

:::

In more formal styles, to refer to something happening immediately after something else, we use *scarcely/hardly … when*. We move *hardly* and *scarcely* to front position and invert the subject and verb:

- ***Scarcely*** *\[V\] had \[S\]* I *got myself comfortable and closed my eyes **when** I heard the sound of the alarm.*
