## Next as an adjective

### Next or the next?

When we talk about days of the week, weeks, months, years, seasons or public holidays in the future in relation to now, we use *next* without *the* and without a preposition:

- *I have an appointment with the dentist **next** Wednesday morning.*
- Not: … ~~the next Wednesday morning~~.

- *Are you working **next** week?*
- Not: *~~Are you working on next week?~~*
- ***Next*** *year will be our fortieth wedding anniversary.*
- *We’re going to plant some new flowers **next** spring.*

To refer to the future, we can use *the next few hours*, *the next two days*, *the next six months*, etc.:

- *I’ll finish the work in **the next few days**. You can pay me then.*
- *We’ll be home for **the next three weeks**, then we’re going away to France for two weeks.*

When we talk about times in the past or future not related to now, we normally use *the*. However, in informal situations, we can omit *the* when we talk about the past:

- ***The next day*** *we travelled to the ancient city of Qom.*
- *We’re going to spend the first night in Oslo, then **the next day** we’ll fly to Narvik.*
- *Two policemen grabbed me. **Next minute**, I was arrested and thrown into a van.*

### The next time

We can use *the next time* to refer to the past or to the future. In informal situations, we can omit *the*:

- *We’ve been to Australia a few times. The first time we went it was work, then **the next time** we went it was a mix of work and holiday.*
- ***The next time*** *you’re in Ireland, you must come and visit us.*
- *I saw him about five years ago and he was unemployed. **Next time** I saw him he was driving a bus.* (informal)

## Next as an adverb

- \[a group of children are waiting to ride a pony\]
- Adult: *Who wants to go **next**?*
- Child: *Me! Me!*
- *He said he was upset about the drama club, but I can’t remember what he said **next**.*

## Next as a linking adjunct

We can use *next* as a linking adjunct to refer to something which follows immediately after something before. We often use this when giving instructions:

- *To convert your old cassette tapes to CDs, first you will need a cable to connect your cassette player to your computer. **Next**, you will need some sort of software to convert your music to a digital format such as MP3.*

## Next as a pronoun

We can use *next* as a pronoun with or without *the*:

- *Ollie’s coming to stay the week after **next**.* (the week after next week)
- *I don’t know how I’m going to manage from one day to **the*** ***next**.*

## Next to

We can use *next to* for people or things that are very near or beside each other:

- *Can I sit **next to** you at the restaurant? There’s something I want to tell you.*

We can also use *next to* when we are comparing things:

- ***Next to*** *English, my best language is Spanish.* (English is my best language, then Spanish.)

## Next: typical error

When we say *next week, next summer, next August*, etc., we don’t use a preposition:

- *I’m going away **next** Wednesday.*
- Not: *~~I’m going away on next Wednesday.~~*
