# Now

## Now as an adverb of time

We use *now* most commonly as an adverb of time. It means ‘at the present time’, ‘at this moment’ or ‘very soon’. We usually put *now* with this meaning in end position:

- *My father worked here and my brothers work here **now**.*
- *I don’t want anything to eat **now**. I’ll have something later.*
- *Can we go **now**?*

In more formal styles, we can use *now* in mid position (between the subject and the main verb, or after the modal verb or first auxiliary verb, or after *be* as a main verb):

- *She used to work as a city economist; she **now** works as an adviser to the oil industry.*
- *Laura Tranter is a young theatre director who is **now** in the middle of rehearsals for ‘Romeo and Juliet’.*

We can premodify *now*. We use *just now* to talk about something that has happened recently and *right now* to talk about something that is either happening or is about to happen immediately:

- *I thought I saw her car here **just now**, going towards Dersingham’s house.* (very recently)
- *‘I need to talk to you for a minute.’ She shook her head. ‘I’m sorry, but I’m pretty busy **right now**.’*
- *I’ll phone her **right now**.* (immediately)

Spoken English:

We use *now* in speaking, to signal what is going to happen next. We often find this in a classroom or meeting when the speaker is giving instructions or information or looking ahead to the next point of discussion. This meaning of *now* is common in mid position or front position:

- *We’re **now** going to look at the exercise on page 10.*
- *I’d **now** like to introduce the next speaker.*
- ***Now*** *I think we should discuss the sales figures.*

When *now* is in mid position, we often use it to express change as the result of something:

- *The business has become bigger and bigger. We **now** have offices in Japan, America and Belgium as well as the UK.*
- *It is **now** clear that dinosaurs were supreme for 130 million years, and that mammals co-existed with them.*

## Now as a discourse marker

We use *now* in speaking to signal something new, particularly when giving instructions or introducing a new idea or topic. We often use it with other similar markers such as *right* or *OK*:

- ***Now****, before we start the actual meeting proper, I’ve invited Carol to come along and tell you about our recycling project.*
- \[teacher in class\]
- *Right. **Now**, I don’t want anyone to call out the answers. Okay? Listen.*

## Now for emphasis

We sometimes use *now* to make a command or order stronger. We use it before or after imperative clauses:

- ***Now*** *stop crying. It’s going to be OK.*
- *Don’t lose them **now**. They’re my favourite gloves.*

## Now (that)

We can use *now* *that* as a conjunction to refer to something and its result(s):

- ***Now that*** *she had his attention, she couldn’t think of anything to say.*

In informal speaking we can leave out *that*:

- ***Now*** *(**that**) the weather’s nice, the children play outside all day.*
