# Often

*Often* is an adverb meaning ‘many times on different occasions’. Like many other short adverbs, we use it in front position, in mid position (between the subject and the main verb, or after the modal verb or first auxiliary verb, or after *be* as a main verb) or in end position:

- *I **often** see Christine when I’m in town. She must do her shopping in the same places as me.*
- A: *I love that Indian restaurant on Mill Street*.
- B: *D’you go there **often**?*
- A: *Not very* ***often***, *I mean, maybe once a month or so*.

Front position is the least common position, and sounds more formal:

- *We used to see him on the beach. **Often** he would go for a swim, then he would come and talk to us.*

We can emphasise *often* with *very* or *quite*:

- *I **very often** meet him as he’s coming out of work.*
- *Maggie is old now and she **quite often** forgets things.*

We use *how often* to ask about the frequency of something:

- A: ***How often*** *do you go swimming?*
- B: *About three or four times a week, usually*.
