# Once

*Once* is an adverb or conjunction.

## Once as an adverb

We use *once* as an adverb to mean ‘one single time’:

- *I’ve only met Jane’s husband **once**.* (one time)

We say *once a* + singular time expression and *once every* + plural time expression to talk about how often something happens:

- *They go for dinner together **once*** ***a** month.* (one time per month)
- Not: *~~They go for dinner once the month.~~*
- *I see him **once every** two or three weeks.*

We also use *once* to mean ‘at a time in the past but not now’. In this meaning, we often use it in mid position (between the subject and the main verb, or after the modal verb or first auxiliary verb, or after *be* as a main verb):

- *My father **once** worked on an oilrig.* (He no longer works there.)
- *The Millers **once** owned a dairy farm.* (They no longer own a dairy farm.)
- *She was **once** a schoolteacher but she hated it.*

The phrase *once upon a time* is used at the start of children’s stories. We sometimes use it to mean ‘long ago’:

- ***Once upon a time*** *there was a little girl called Little Red Riding Hood …*
- *You used to go to nightclubs **once upon a time**!*

## Once as a conjunction

We use *once* as a conjunction meaning ‘as soon as’ or ‘after’:

- ***Once*** *I’ve picked Megan up, I’ll call you.*
- *My boss is a nice man **once** you get to know him.*

We don’t use *shall* or *will* in the clause with *once*:

- ***Once*** *I pass all my exams, I’ll be fully qualified.*
- Not: *~~Once I will pass~~* …
