# Only

*Only* is an adjective or adverb.

## Only as an adjective

We use *only* as an adjective to mean that there is just one or very few of something, or that there are no others:

- *He was the **only** person in the room.*
- *Being healthy is the **only** thing that is important to me.*

## Only as an adverb

We use *only* as an adverb to mean that something is limited to some people, things, an amount or an activity:

- *This phone is **only** available in Japan.*
- ***Only*** *a few hundred houses survived the hurricane without any damage.*

*Only* can mean ‘simply’:

- *He’s **only** joking.*

Spoken English:

In speaking, *only* can be used with *just* for emphasis. It can mean ‘very recently’ or ‘almost not’:

- *She’d **only just** moved into her new house last July.* (very recently)
- *The building had survived the earthquake of two years before, but **only*** ***just**.* (It almost didn’t survive the earthquake.)

## Only: position

As an adjective, we use *only* in front of a noun or *one*, or before another adjective or a number:

- *Is that your **only** copy of the book?*
- *He was the **only** one who could read in the village.*
- Not: *~~He was the only who could read~~* …

- *That was the **only** large t-shirt left in that colour.*
- *There were **only** four United fans in the room.*

We can use *only* as an adverb in different positions, depending on its focus. If the subject is the focus, we put *only* in front position:

- ***Only*** *Jason knows where the key is kept.*
- ***Only*** *a very small bed will fit in this room.*

If the focus is on another part of the sentence, we usually put *only* in the normal mid position for adverbs (between the subject and the main verb, or after the modal verb or first auxiliary verb, or after *be* as a main verb):

- *I **only** go home once a month.* (between subject and main verb)
- *She had **only** arrived at midnight the night before.* (after the first auxiliary verb)
- *She’s **only** sixteen.* (after *be* as a main verb)

If the focus is a whole clause, we can put *only* in front position:

- *My arm hurts but **only** when I try to raise it.*
