# Hardly

*Hardly* is an adverb.

*Hardly* has a negative meaning. It normally means ‘almost not at all’ or ‘only just’. We can use it in mid position, or before an adjective or a noun:

- *He wore a big hat that covered his head and you could **hardly** see his face.* (you could only see a small part of his face)
- *It’s **hardly** surprising that Leeds, England’s third largest city, is now fast becoming a very popular UK holiday destination.*
- *At first **hardly** a person in the audience moved, although some umbrellas were opened. But then the rain came down more heavily.*

## Hardly any, hardly ever

We often use *hardly* before *any*, *anyone*, *anybody*, *anything* and *ever* in negative clauses, but not before *no*, *none*, *no one*, *nobody*, *nothing* or *never*:

- *At first, **hardly** anyone came.* (almost no one came)
- Not: *~~At first hardly no one came.~~*
- *There was **hardly** anything to eat.*
- *She lives in Scotland so we **hardly** ever see her now, but I like to keep in touch.*

## Hardly at all

We sometimes use *at all* after the verb, adjective or noun which follows *hardly* to give greater emphasis:

- *I **hardly** slept **at all** last night.*

## Hardly and very little, very few

*Hardly + any(thing)* has a similar meaning to *very little* or *very few*:

- *I **hardly** ate **anything** yesterday.* (= I ate very little yesterday.)
- *She **hardly** buys **any** new clothes at all.* (= She buys very few new clothes.)

- *Little*, *a little*, *few*, *a few*

## Word order

We usually put *hardly* in mid position, between the subject and the main verb, or after the modal verb or first auxiliary verb, or after main verb *be*:

- *My piano lesson is on Monday, and I’ve **hardly** played it this week.*
- *I can **hardly** wait.*
- *There were **hardly** any tourists.*

When *hardly* is modifying either the main verb or the following noun, we can put it directly before the verb or before the noun phrase:

- *She **hardly** had any sleep. or She had **hardly** any sleep.*

In more formal styles, to refer to something happening immediately after something else, we use *hardly … when*. We move *hardly* to front position and invert the subject and verb:

- ***Hardly*** *\[V\] had \[S\] I arrived there when I was called back to the head office 100 miles away.* (I arrived there and then I was immediately called back.)

:::warning

***Hardly*** is not the adverb form of the adjective *hard*. The adverb form of *hard* is also *hard*.
