# Hopefully

The adverb *hopefully* means ‘wanting the answer to be *yes’*:

- *Their father said they were not allowed to have a puppy until they were older but we saw them sitting **hopefully** outside the pet shop.*
- *‘Could you lend me £20?’ he asked **hopefully**.*

We commonly use *hopefully* in front position to say what we wish for or would like to happen. It is also sometimes used as a response to questions:

- ***Hopefully****, the economic problems in the country will not get any worse.*
- A: *Will they win the match tonight?*
- B: ***Hopefully***.
