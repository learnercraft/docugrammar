# Largely

*Largely* means ‘almost completely’:

- *The downturn in the economy in the 1970s was **largely** due to oil prices.*

:::warning

We don’t use *largely* to mean ‘enormously’, ‘greatly’ or ‘significantly’:

- *Traffic flows in the city centre have been **greatly** improved by the opening of the new ring road.*
- Not: … ~~have been largely improved~~ …

:::

We don’t use *largely* to mean ‘widely’ or ‘by many people’:

- *This issue has been **widely** debated in recent years.*
- Not: … ~~has been largely debated~~ …
