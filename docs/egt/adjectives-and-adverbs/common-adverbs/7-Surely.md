# Surely

We use the adverb *surely* to express a degree of certainty. It does not express as much certainty as *definitely* or *certainly*. When we use *surely*, we are hoping that our listener will agree with us:

- *Lisa will **surely** find a solution to the problem.* (I want you to agree with me that Lisa will find a solution.)
- ***Surely*** *this is against the law.* (I want you to agree with me that it is against the law.)

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>It’s</i> <b><i>surely</i></b> <i>quicker if you have a computer</i>.</td><td><i>It’s</i> <b><i>certainly</i></b> <i>quicker if you have a computer</i>.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>I think that it is quicker if you have a computer and I want you to agree.</td><td>I am certain that it is quicker if you have a computer.</td></tr></tbody></table>

We can use *surely*, especially in negative question forms, to show surprise:

- ***Surely*** *you’re not going to take two weeks off work?* (I am surprised that you’re going to take two weeks off.)
- ***Surely*** *she’s not interested in a job like that?* (I am surprised that she is interested in a job like that.)
