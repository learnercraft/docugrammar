# Ultimately

*Ultimately* is an adverb. We use it to mean ‘finally, after a series of things have happened’:

- ***Ultimately****, I’d like to go to university, but before that I want to get some work experience and travel a bit.*
- *We came to the conclusion **ultimately** that political demonstrations were a waste of time.*

:::warning

*Ultimately* does not mean ‘recently’:

- ***Recently****, the price of shares in the company has dropped.*
- Not: *~~Ultimately, the price of shares in the company has dropped.~~*
