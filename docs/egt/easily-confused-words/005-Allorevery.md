# All or every?

*All* and *every* are determiners.

We use both *all* and *every* to refer to the total number of something. *All* refers to a complete group. *Every* refers to each member of a complete group:

- *The questionnaire was sent to **all employees**.*
- *The questionnaire was sent to **every employee**.*

We can use *every* to focus on each individual member.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>All passengers</i></b><i> must turn off their mobile phones.</i></td><td>refers to the whole group</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>Every passenger</i></b><i> must turn off their mobile phone.</i>(We use <i>their</i> instead of <i>his</i> or <i>her</i> to refer back to a singular noun (<i>passenger</i>) because we are referring to both male and female passengers.)</td><td>focuses on each individual member of the whole group</td></tr></tbody></table>

We can use *all*, but not *every*, on its own without a noun. We use *everyone*/*everybody*/*everything* instead:

- *The meeting is at Oriel Hall. It begins at 8 pm and **all** are welcome.*
- Not: … ~~every is welcome~~
- ***Everyone*** *is welcome to join the village social club.*

- *Every*

## All and every \+ nouns

The meaning of *all* and *every* is very similar but we use them in different ways. We use *all* with plural and uncountable nouns and *every* with singular nouns:

- ***All donations*** *will be sent to the earthquake relief fund.*
- ***All equipment*** *must be returned by the end of June.* (uncountable)
- ***Every donation*** *is appreciated.*

We can use *all* and *all of* before determiners, but we don’t use *every* before determiners:

- *I invited **all (of) my** friends.*
- Not: … ~~every my friends~~

## All (of) the

We can use *all* and *all of* before articles (*the, a/an*), demonstratives (*this, that*) and possessives (*our, his*) but we can’t use *every* before them:

- \[talking about a library\]
- *It has got **all (of) the** books that have ever been published.*
- Not: *~~It has got every the book or It has got the every book~~*
- *She’s gone to **all (of) their** concerts this year. She hasn’t missed one.*
- Not: … ~~every their concerts~~

- *All of*
- *All* without *of*

## All day, every day

We use *all day*, *all week*, *all month* to mean ‘one entire day/week/month’:

- *We spent **all day** at the beach yesterday.*

*Every day* (*week/month*) focuses on each individual day (week/month):

- *We spent **every day** at the beach in the holidays.*
- Not: *~~We spent all days at the beach~~*
- *Fuel prices are rising **every week**.*
- Not: *~~Fuel prices are rising all weeks.~~*

## All or every: typical errors

We don’t use *every* before determiners:

- *He sold **all (of) his** books.*
- Not: … ~~every his books.~~

We don’t use *every* with uncountable nouns:

- ***All (the) information*** *can be saved in the computer memory.*
- Not: *~~Every information can be saved~~* …

We don’t use *every* with plural nouns:

- *We should organise a trip for **all students**.*
- Not: … ~~for every students~~

We don’t use *every* on its own without a noun; we use *everyone*, *everybody* or *everything* instead:

- *He suggested cancelling the trip and **everyone agreed**.*
- Not: … ~~every agreed~~
