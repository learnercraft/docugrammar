# Alone, lonely, or lonesome?

## Alone or lonely?

*Alone* is an adjective and an adverb meaning that no other person is with you. When we use *alone* as an adjective, it never comes before the noun (predicative adjective):

- *She was **alone** when she heard the sad news.* (adjective)
- *It’s impossible to discuss as a committee. The chairman **alone** will decide.* (adverb)
- *Did they travel **alone** or did they take the children with them?* (adverb)
- *Do you live **alone**?* (adverb)

*Lonely* means that no other person is with you and that you are sad and unhappy as a result. We may choose to be alone but generally we do not choose to be *lonely:*

- *Without her friends, it was a long and **lonely** journey.*
- *She says she feels very **lonely** and depressed living in that big house.*

We don’t use *lonely* as an adverb:

- *I prefer going to lunch **alone**.*
- Not: *~~I prefer going to lunch lonely.~~*

## Lonesome

In American English, *lonesome* means the same as *lonely*:

- *If they’re away from home, they get **lonesome**.* (If they’re away from home, they get lonely).
