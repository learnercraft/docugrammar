# Along or alongside?

*Along* and *alongside* are prepositions or adverbs.

As a preposition, *along* means ‘in a line next to something long and thin’, e.g. a road, a path:

We use *along* as an adverb with verbs of motion meaning ‘together with’:

- *Why don’t you come **along** with us to the party?*
- *They said they’d bring the bikes **along** and we can ride to the swimming pool.*

## Alongside

As a preposition, *alongside* means ‘close beside’, ‘next to’ or ‘together with’:

- *Put your bike **alongside** mine.* (next to)
- *I find it difficult to cope with this illness **alongside** all my other problems.* (together with)

We also use *alongside* as an adverb, meaning ‘along the side of’ or ‘next to’ something:

- *I parked my car in the drive and William parked his **alongside**.*
