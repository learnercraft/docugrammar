# Altogether or all together?

## Altogether

*Altogether* means ‘completely’ or ‘in total’:

- *In 1997 the sales tax was lowered to 4%, then in 2001 it was abolished **altogether**.*
- *The book was €13.50 and the magazine was €5.25, so it was €18.75 **altogether**.*

## All together

*All together* means ‘with each other’, and is similar to *together*:

- *Put your clothes **all together** in one pile and I’ll wash them for you.*
- Not: *~~Put your clothes altogether in one pile~~* …

- \[a group of five people are waiting at the entrance to a restaurant\]
- Waiter: *Are you **all together**?*
- Customer: *Yes. Can you do a table for five?*
