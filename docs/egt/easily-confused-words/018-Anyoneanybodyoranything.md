# Anyone, anybody or anything?

*Anyone*, *anybody* and *anything* are indefinite pronouns.

We use *anyone*, *anybody* and *anything* to refer to both an open, unlimited set of things or people and specific things or people. We use them with a singular verb:

- *Has **anyone** got a dictionary?*
- ***Anybody*** *is welcome to join. There aren’t any rules.*
- *Can I do **anything** to help?*
- *I don’t know **anybody** who speaks Portuguese.*

We often use the plural pronoun *they* to refer back to (singular) *anyone* when we do not know if the person is male or female:

- *If **anyone** would like further information about the dogs, **they** should call Canine Rescue on 0502 75257.* (The same as *If **anyone** would like further information about the dogs*, ***he or she*** *should call Canine Rescue on 0502 75257*.)

*Anything, anyone, anybody* don’t have a negative meaning on their own:

- *We stayed in Sevilla for the rest of our holidays. **No one** wanted to come back, but we had to.*
- Not: *~~Anyone wanted to come back.~~*

- *Any*

## Anyone and anybody

*Anyone* and *anybody* have no difference in meaning. *Anybody* is a little less formal than *anyone*. *Anyone* is used more in writing than *anybody*:

- *I didn’t know **anybody** at the party.*
- \[talking about the New Zealand rugby team, the All Blacks\]
- *It is hard to find **anyone** who thinks that the All Blacks will face a stronger team.*
