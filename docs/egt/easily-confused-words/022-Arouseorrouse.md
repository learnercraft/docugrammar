# Arouse or rouse?

*Rouse* and *arouse* are both used in formal contexts. *Arouse* means ‘make someone have a particular feeling’:

- *Both lecturers **aroused** a lot of interest in the subject of geology.*

*Rouse* means ‘wake someone up’ or ‘make someone active’:

- *The goal **roused** the supporters and they began to really get behind the team.* (*get behind* means ‘support’)

We also use *rouse* as a reflexive verb:

- *She finally **roused** herself at lunchtime and got out of bed.*
