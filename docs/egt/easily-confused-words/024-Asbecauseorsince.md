# As, because or since?

*As*, *because* and *since* are conjunctions. *As*, *because* and *since* all introduce subordinate clauses. They connect the result of something with its reason.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>result</td><td>reason</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>He decided to go to the conference in Barcelona,</i></td><td><b><i>as</i></b><i> he was in Spain anyway.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Are you angry with me</i></td><td><b><i>because</i></b><i> I opened the letter?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Bilardo coaches his team by telephone,</i>(Bilardo was the coach of the Argentinian football team)</td><td><b><i>since</i></b><i> half of them play in Italy, France or Spain.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Because

*Because* is more common than *as* and *since*, both in writing and speaking. When we use *because*, we are focusing on the reason:

- *She spoke quietly **because** she didn’t want Catherine to hear.*
- *We’ll come over on Sunday **because** David’s got to work on Saturday.*

We often put the *because*\-clause at the beginning of a sentence, especially when we want to give extra focus to the reason. We use a comma after the *because*\-clause:

- ***Because*** *breathing is something we do automatically, we rarely think about it.*

We can use a *because*\-clause on its own without the main clause in speaking or informal writing:

- A: *Would you like to go to school there?*
- B: *Yes*.
- A: *Why?*
- B: ***Because*** *my best friend goes there*. (I would like to go to school there because my best friend goes there.)

:::warning

We don’t use a *because*\-clause on its own in formal writing:

- *In 1998, the government introduced a new import tax **because** people were importing cars from abroad.*
- Not: … ~~a new import tax. Because people were importing cars from abroad.~~

:::

### Cos

We often shorten *because* to *cos* /kəz/ or /kɒz/ in informal speaking and writing:

- *I’m laughing **cos** I’m so happy.*

- *Because*, *because of* and *cos*, *cos of*

## As and since

We often use *as* and *since* when we want to focus more on the result than the reason. *As* and *since* are more formal than *because*. We usually put a comma before *since* after the main clause:

- *\[result\] I hope they’ve decided to come **as** \[reason\] I wanted to hear about their India trip.*
- *\[result\] They’re rather expensive, **since** \[reason\] they’re quite hard to find.*

We often use *as* and *since* clauses at the beginning of the sentence. We use a comma after the *as-* or *since-* clause:

- ***Since*** *everything can be done from home with computers and telephones, there’s no need to dress up for work any more.*
- ***As*** *everyone already knows each other, there’s no need for introductions. We’ll get straight into the business of the meeting.*

We use *because*, not *as* or *since*, in questions where the speaker proposes a reason:

- *Are you feeling unwell **because** you ate too much?*
- Not: *~~Are you feeling unwell since you ate too much?~~ or … ~~as you ate too much?~~*
