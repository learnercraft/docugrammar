# Been or gone?

We often use *been to*, instead of *gone to*, when we refer to completed visits to a place:

- *Have you ever **been** to Budapest?*
- Not: *~~Have you ever gone to Budapest?~~*

If the visit is not complete, we use *gone*.

Would you like one?</i></td><td>Joan has returned from the shop.</td></tr></tbody></table>
