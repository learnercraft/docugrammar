# Beside or besides?

## Beside

*Beside* is a preposition. It means ‘at the side of’ or ‘next to’. It is rather formal:

- *He would like to take a photograph of us. Would you come and sit **beside** me?*
- *There was a small table **beside** the bed, on which there was a book.*

## Besides

*Besides* is a preposition or a linking adverb. It means ‘in addition to’ or ‘also’:

- *What other types of music do you like **besides** classical?*

As a linking adverb, we usually put a comma before and after *besides* in writing:

- *I don’t think going for a walk is a good idea. It’s quite cold, and, **besides**, it’s getting late and we don’t want to be out in the dark.*
