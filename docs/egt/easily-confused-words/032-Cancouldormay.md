# Can, could or may?

## Possibility

When we talk about possibility, we use *can, could* and *may*, but they are different in meaning.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>It </i><b><i>can</i></b><i> be dangerous to cycle in the city.</i></td><td>This expresses what the speaker believes is a general truth or known fact, or a strong possibility.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>It </i><b><i>could/may</i></b><i> be dangerous to cycle in the city.</i></td><td>This does not express a general truth. The speaker is only expressing a weak possibility.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>It</i><b><i>’s dangerous</i></b><i> to cycle in the city.</i></td><td>This expresses a real fact using the present simple. The speaker is certain and no modality is used.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Permission

We use *can, could* and *may* to ask for permission. We use *can* and *may*, but not *could*, to give permission. *May* is less common:

## Requests

When we make requests, we can use *can* or *could* (but not *may*). *Could* is more polite than *can*:

- ***Can*** *you call back later? I’m busy now.*
- ***Could*** *you call back later? I’m busy now.*

Teachers and parents often use *can* and *could* in requests:

- ***Can*** *you open you books at page 34, please.*
- ***Can*** *you please refrain from chewing gum.*
- ***Could*** *you just sit down and listen!*

## Can, could or may: typical errors

*Could* in the present only expresses weak possibility. *Can* expresses strong possibility:

- *I **can** travel in July because my exams will definitely be finished at the beginning of that month.* (strong possibility)
- *I **could** travel in July because my exams will probably be finished at the beginning of that month.* (weak possibility)

We don’t normally use *could* to talk about general truths which refer to the present time. We use *can* instead:

- *Not everyone **can** afford to buy organic food.*
- Not: *~~Not everyone could afford~~* …

We use *could*, not *can*, to express future possibility. *Can* expresses that we are certain of something:

- *Working in London next summer **could** be a great experience.* (The speaker thinks this is possible, in particular circumstances)
- Not: … ~~can be a great experience~~.
