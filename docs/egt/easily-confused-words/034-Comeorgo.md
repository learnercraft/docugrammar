# Come or go?

We use *come* to describe movement between the speaker and listener, and movement from another place to the place where the speaker or listener is. We usually use *go* to talk about movement from where the speaker or listener is to another place.

When we talk about another person (someone who is neither the speaker nor the listener), we can use either *come* or *go*, depending on whether the speaker sees things from the receiver’s viewpoint (*come*) or the doer’s viewpoint (*go*).

## Come in, go in

*Come in* and *go in* both mean *‘*enter’:

- \[dentist’s assistant to a patient who is waiting\]
- *Will you* ***come in now, please.***
- \[at a beach on a cold day\]
- *It’s so cold! I don’t want to **go in** the water.*
