# Consider or regard?

*Consider* and *regard* can both mean ‘believe’ or ‘realise’ or ‘understand’. When they mean ‘believe’ or ‘realise’ or ‘understand’, we don’t often use the continuous forms.

## Consider

*Consider* takes several different patterns.

### Consider \+ that\-clause

- *When you **consider** that she was very scared, her story is even more remarkable*.

### Consider \+ object + to be

- *They **consider** him to be the best chef in the country*.

### Consider \+ object + to have

- *The ministry of trade **considered** the company to have the best vision for exports*.

:::warning

We don’t use *as* with *consider*:

- *We **consider** this **to be** a very serious issue.*
- Not: *~~We consider this as a very serious issue.~~*

:::

## Regard

We often use *regard* in the phrase ‘*regard as*’: *regard* (+ object) + *as* + noun phrase or adjective phrase:

- *The United Nations **regard** human rights **as** their main priority.*
- *Alexander Graham Bell is **regarded*** ***as** the inventor of the telephone.*
- *Do you **regard** their behaviour **as** good or bad?*

## Typical error

We don’t usually use the continuous forms of *consider* and *regard*:

- *When you **consider** that he was too young, you have to blame his parents.*
- Not: *~~When you are considering that he was too young~~* …
- *The government **regards** the economy as a main priority.*
- Not: *~~The government is regarding the economy~~* …
