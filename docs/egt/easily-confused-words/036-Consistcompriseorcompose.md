# Consist, comprise or compose?

*Consist*, *comprise* and *compose* are all verbs used to describe what something is ‘made of’. We don’t use them in continuous forms.

## Consist

- *Their diet only **consisted of** fruit and seeds.*
- *The whole group **consists of** students.*

We only use the active form of *consist of*:

- *Their flat **consists of** two bedrooms, a kitchen and a bathroom.*
- Not: *~~Their flat is consisted of two bedrooms~~*…

## Comprise

*Comprise* is more formal than *consist*:

- *The USA **comprises** 50 states.*

We can also use it in the passive voice in the form ‘*be comprised of*’:

- *The course **is comprised of** ten lectures and five seminars on the theory of economics and banking.*

*Comprise*, but not *compose*, can be used with the parts that make up something as the subject:

- *Oil and coal **comprise** 70% of the nation’s exports.*

*Compose of* is even more formal than *consist of* and *comprise*. *Compose of* is only used in the passive voice:

- *Muscle **is composed of** different types of protein.*

## Typical errors

We don’t use *consist, comprise* and *compose* in a continuous form:

- *The whole group **consists of** students.*
- Not: *~~The whole group is consisting of students.~~*
