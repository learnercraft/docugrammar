# Down, downwards or downward?

## Down

We use *down* mostly as a preposition or adverb. It means ‘in or moving to a low or lower position or level’:

- *We ran **down** the hill like two little children.*
- *Jamie, put that vase **down**! You’ll break it!*

We can also use *down* to mean ‘towards the south’, ‘generally in the south’, or ‘towards the place where a river meets the sea’:

- *When you were living in Spain, did you ever go **down** to Granada?*
- *We went on a cruise **down** the Nile for seven days. It was fantastic.*

In informal situations, we can use *down* to talk about a quick trip to a destination which we consider to be less central than where we are. In this meaning, we can use it with or without *to*. Without *to* is less formal:

- *I’m just going **down (to)** the shop. Do you want anything?*
- *Are you going **down (to)** the golf club tonight?*

*Down* can also mean ‘along’. We can use it with *from*:

- *Mila’s office is just **down** the corridor, second door on the left.*
- *They live just **down** the street **from** our house.*

A good dictionary will tell you more meanings of *down*, especially when it is used as part of a phrasal verb.

## Downwards, downward

*Downwards* is an adverb. It means ‘movement towards a lower position’:

- *The garden slopes gently **downwards** in the direction of the river.*
- *Could you point the reading lamp **downwards**? It’s shining in my eyes.*

In American English, *downward* (with no final *\-s*) is used as an adverb:

- *Since the nineteen seventies, our country has really taken some steps **downward**.*

In British English, *downward* (with no final *\-s*) is normally only used as an adjective:

- *The statistics for violent crimes have shown a **downward** trend in the last two years.* (The numbers have gone down.)
