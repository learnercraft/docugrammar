# East or eastern; north or northern?

## North, south, east, west

We usually use *north*, *south*, *east*, *west*, not *northern*, *southern, eastern* and *western*, to refer to specific places or to direction of movement. We can use *north*, *south, east* and *west* as adjectives or adverbs and occasionally as nouns:

- *More and more people are buying second homes on the **south** coast of Ireland.* (adjective)
- *After Bangkok, we drove **north** for about six hours without stopping.* (adverb)

We normally use capital letters in place names with *north, south, east* and *west*:

- *The conference is taking place in **North** Dakota.*
- \[from an advertisement in a travel magazine\]
- *Bargain flights to **South** America from London Gatwick from Â£350.*

## Northern, southern, eastern and western: larger areas

We commonly use *northern, southern, eastern* and *western* (without capital letters) to refer to larger areas or territory. We can only use them as adjectives:

- *The **northern** parts of India have suffered severe flooding.*
- *Houses are more expensive in most **western** parts of the country.*

Some names of specific places have capital letters for *northern, southern*, *eastern* and *western*:

- *We are holidaying in **Northern** Ireland next year.* (name of a region)
- *Perth is the capital of **Western** Australia.* (name of a state)
