# Economic or economical?

*Economic* and *economical* are adjectives.

We use *economic* to mean ‘related to trade, industry or money’:

- *The **economic** forecast for next year is not good.*
- *The President spoke mostly about **economic** policy.*

We use *economical* to mean ‘not using a lot of money’:

- *Hybrid cars are very* ***economical.*** (They do not cost a lot of money to run.)
- *Solar energy for your home is expensive in the short term but it is more **economical** in the long term.*
