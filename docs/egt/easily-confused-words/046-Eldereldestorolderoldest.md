# Elder, eldest or older, oldest?

*Elder* and *eldest* mean the same as *older* and *oldest*. We only use the adjectives *elder* and *eldest* before a noun (as attributive adjectives), and usually when talking about relationships within a family:

- *Let me introduce Siga. She’s my **elder** sister.* Not: … ~~She’s my sister. She’s elder~~.
- *It’s Catherine’s eightieth birthday on Thursday and she is now the **eldest** member of the family.*

We also use *elder* and *eldest* as nouns:

- *Jack is the **eldest** of four brothers.*

*Older* and *oldest* are used in similar ways:

- *My **older** sister is coming to stay with us at the weekend.*
- *Matt is the **oldest** of our children and Simon is the youngest.*

*Older* and *oldest* can be used to refer to the age of things more generally:

- *The town hall is by far the **oldest** building in the whole region.*
- Not: *~~The town hall is by far the eldest building~~* …

We can use *older* and *oldest* after a linking verb (as predicative adjectives):

- *I think her grandfather must be **older** than her grandmother.*
- Not: *~~I think her grandfather must be elder than~~* …
