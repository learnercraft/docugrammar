# Especially or specially?

*Especially* and *specially* are adverbs.

*Especially* means ‘particularly’ or ‘above all’:

- *She loves flowers, **especially** roses.*
- *I am **especially** grateful to all my family and friends who supported me.* Not: *~~Especially I am~~* …

We use *specially* to talk about the specific purpose of something:

- *This kitchen was **specially** designed to make it easy for a disabled person to use.*
- *He has his shirts made **specially** for him by a tailor in London.*

*Especially* can also be used to mean ‘for a particular purpose’:

- *I bought these **(e)specially** for you.*
