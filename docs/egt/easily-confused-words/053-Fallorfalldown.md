# Fall or fall down?

We can use *fall* as a noun or a verb. It means ‘suddenly go down onto the ground or towards the ground unintentionally or accidentally’. It can also mean ‘come down from a higher position’. As a verb, it is irregular. Its past form is *fell* and its *\-ed* form is *fallen. Fall* does not need an object:

- *Mrs McGrath had a terrible **fall** yesterday. She’s in hospital now.* (noun)
- *Four trees **fell** in the storm.* (verb)
- *Oil prices have **fallen** recently.*

*Fall down* is a phrasal verb. We use it when something falls to the ground from its normal position:

- *The picture keeps **falling down**.* (from the wall to the ground)
- *He slipped and **fell down**.*

:::warning

We use *fall*, not *fall down*, when trees drop their leaves during the autumn:

- *As autumn came and the leaves **fell** from the trees, she began to feel sad.*
- Not: … ~~the leaves fell down~~ …

:::

We can’t use *fall down* to mean ‘come down from a higher position’:

- *House prices have* ***fallen a lot this year.***
- Not: *~~House prices have fallen down a lot~~* …
