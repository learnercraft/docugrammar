# Farther, farthest or further, furthest?

## Comparative forms

*Farther* and *further* are comparative adverbs or adjectives. They are the irregular comparative forms of *far*. We use them to talk about distance. There is no difference in meaning between them. *Further* is more common:

- *We can’t go any **further**; the road’s blocked.*
- *After this, I felt a little refreshed but as I came over the hill, my legs rebelled. I could walk no **further**.*
- *How much **farther** are we going?*

*Farther*, and, much less commonly, *further* can be used as adjectives to refer to distance away from the speaker:

- *He could see a small boat on the **farther** shore.*
- *At the **further** end of the village stood an old ruined house.*

We often repeat *farther* or *further* to emphasise the distance:

- *‘I am just a little ship,’ Aunt Emily said, ‘drifting **farther** and **farther** out to sea.’*

We often use *along* with *farther* and *further*:

- *Ben Gunn had told me his boat was hidden near the white rock, and I found that rock **farther** along the beach.*

We often use *a little*, *a bit* or *a lot* before *further* and *farther*:

- \[in an aerobics exercise class\]
- *Now push and stretch that arm just **a little*** ***further** and count to ten.*

## Superlative forms

*Farthest* and *furthest* are superlative adjectives or adverbs. They are the irregular superlative forms of *far*. We use them to talk about distance. There is no difference in meaning between them. *Furthest* is more common than *farthest*:

- *The **furthest** galaxies are about three thousand million light years away.*
- *Go on, boys! Let’s see who can run **furthest**.*
- *Viv took a corner seat **farthest** away from the door.*

## Further (but not farther)

There are some occasions when we can use *further* but not *farther*.

We use *further* before a noun to mean ‘extra’, ‘additional’ or ‘a higher level’:

- *For **further** information, please ring 095-6710090.*
- *A **further** door led off to the right, with a tiled passage taking her to the bathroom, and another large square room at the end, which was probably the dining-room.*
- *She’s gone to a college of **further** education.* (a place to study practical subjects from age 17)

We also use *further* to mean ‘more’:

- *I do not propose to discuss it any **further**.*
- *Before you look at your programme, let me explain a little **further**.*

The expression *further to* is often used in formal letters and emails when someone writes as a follow-up to a previous letter or email:

- ***Further to*** *my email of 22nd January, I’m now writing to ask if you have considered our offer and whether you wish to proceed with the contract.*
