# Finally, at last, lastly or in the end?

*Finally, at last, lastly and in the end* all have a meaning of ‘after a period of time’. However, we use them in different ways.

## Finally

We use *finally* to refer to something that happened after a long time and usually after some difficulties. In this meaning, *finally* most commonly occurs in the normal mid position for adverbs, between the subject and the main verb, after the modal verb or the first auxiliary verb, or after *be* as a main verb:

- *There were no taxis and* we ***finally*** got *home at 2 pm.*
- *She’s had over twenty interviews but Jasmine* has ***finally*** got *a job as a journalist.*

## At last

We use *at last* when we have been impatient as a result of long delays. Like *finally, at last* occurs in the normal mid position for adverbs as well as in front and end position:

- ***At last*** *I’ve discovered how to print envelopes on my printer!*
- *She has **at last** given me the book she promised me.*
- *They’re here **at last!**! We’ve been waiting half an hour.*

## Lastly

We use *lastly* to refer to something that comes at the end of a long list:

- *We need eggs, milk, sugar, bread and, **lastly**, we mustn’t forget yoghurt for Dad.*
- *I’ve thanked my parents but **lastly** I must thank all my friends for their help.*

## In the end

We use *in the end* to refer to a conclusion after a long process, after a lot of changes or after a lot of discussion:

- *We were going to ski in Austria, then the South of France and **in the end** we decided to go to Italy.*
- *And then, **in the end**, after months of discussion they offered to buy our house.*
