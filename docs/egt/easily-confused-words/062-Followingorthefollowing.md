# Following or the following?

We use *following* without *the* + noun phrase to mean ‘after’, ‘in response to’ or ‘as a result of’:

- ***Following*** *the bad election results of May 8th, the Prime Minister has appointed three new ministers.*
- ***Following*** *a general strike in 1933, he fled the country and went to South America.*

We use *the following* with a noun. It means ‘the next’:

- *They only stayed at the hotel one night and left early **the following** morning.*
- *We went out on the boat. The sea was really rough and **the following** hour was the worst in my short life.*

We also use *the following* without another noun to introduce things or people which we then list:

- *I’m afraid I can’t eat any of **the following**: tomatoes, cucumber, onions and cabbage.*
- ***The following*** *have helped me with this book of photographs: David Jones, Gill Farmer, Martin Weekes and Anthony Gray.*
