# For or since?

We use *for* with a period of time in the past, present or future.

We use *since* with a point in time in the past.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>He lived in Oxford </i><b><i>for</i></b><i> 3 years and then he moved.</i> (completed past)<i>They’ve lived in Oxford </i><b><i>for</i></b><i> a couple of months.</i> (began in the past and continues into the present)<i>We’re going to stay in Oxford </i><b><i>for</i></b><i> three days and then we’re going to London </i><b><i>for</i></b><i> a day.</i> (future plans)</td><td><i>For</i> refers to periods of time, e.g. 3 years, 4 hours, ages, a long time, months, years.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>They’ve lived in Oxford </i><b><i>since</i></b><i> 2004.</i></td><td><i>Since</i> refers to a previous point in time.</td></tr></tbody></table>

:::warning

We don’t use *since* with periods of time:

- *She’s been on the phone **for** hours.*
- Not: *~~She’s been on the phone since hours.~~*
