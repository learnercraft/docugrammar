# Hear or listen (to)?

‘Hearing’ is an event; it is something which happens to us as a natural process. ‘Listening’ is an action; it is something we do consciously.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>hearing is an event.</td><td>listening is an action.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Suddenly I </i><b><i>heard</i></b><i> a noise. Someone was in the garden.</i><i>Did you </i><b><i>hear</i></b><i> the thunder last night?</i>[on the phone]<i>The line is very bad. I can’t </i><b><i>hear</i></b><i> you.</i></td><td><i>I </i><b><i>listened</i></b><i> very carefully </i><b><i>to</i></b><i> what she said and wrote it all down.</i><i>Do you </i><b><i>listen to</i></b><i> the radio in bed?</i><i>George! </i><b><i>Listen to</i></b><i> me! I have something important to tell you.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

Sometimes we can use either *hear* or *listen to*, depending on whether we want to emphasise the event or the action:

- *Did you **hear** that interview with David Beckham on the radio yesterday?* (emphasis on the event)
- *Did you **listen to** that interview with David Beckham on the radio yesterday?* (emphasis on the action)
- *I love **hearing/listening to** the sound of falling rain.*

We don’t normally use *hear* in the continuous form. We often use *hear* with *can*:

- \[on an internet phone call\]
- *I **can hear** you really clearly.*
- Not: *~~I’m hearing you really clearly.~~*

:::warning

We use *to* after *listen* before an object:

- *Every morning I **listen to** my Mozart CD while I’m having breakfast. It prepares me mentally for the day.*
- Not: *~~Every morning I listen my Mozart CD~~* …

:::

We use *listen* without *to* if we do not mention the object, or if it is a discourse marker:

- *Meena, **listen**! I don’t want you staying out late!*
- ***Listen****, I was wondering if you could help me.* (discourse marker beginning a new topic or phase of a conversation)
- *The music was beautiful. We just sat there and **listened**.*

- Discourse markers (*so, right, okay*)
