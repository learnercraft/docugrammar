# House or home?

We use the noun *house* to refer to a building:

- *They’re building six new **houses** at the end of our road.*

When we refer to being *at someone’s house*, we can leave out the word *house* and use *at* + possessive or *at* + the definite article + possessive:

- *We stayed overnight **at Mike’s**.* (at Mike’s house)
- *We’re going to be at **the Jacksons’** this evening. Want to come with us?* (at the Jacksons’ house)

We use *home* in a more personal and emotional way to refer to where someone lives. The noun *home* does not usually refer to the building. We often use *home* with the preposition *at*:

- *It’s not very big but it’s my **home**.*
- *Why don’t you phone her now? I think she’s **at home**.*

When we talk about the building we live in, we use *house* not *home*:

- *Our dog stays in the **house** with us.*
- Not: *~~Our dog stays in the home with us~~*.

:::warning

We usually don’t use an article or other determiner with home unless we are talking about homes in general:

- *A lot of energy can be saved in **the home** by making small changes such as turning off lights.* (energy can be saved in all homes)

:::

We use *home* as an adverb with verbs of movement such as *get, go, come, arrive, travel, drive*. We don’t use *to*:

- *I’m **going home** now. I’m really tired.*
- Not: *~~I’m going to home now.~~*
- *Would you like me to **drive** you **home**?*
- Not: *~~Would you like me to drive you to home?~~*

*Home* can be used as a countable noun to refer to the place where people or animals live and are cared for by people who are not their relatives or owners:

- *There’s a **home** for the elderly at the end of our street.*
- *We got our dog, Scotty, from the local dogs’ **home**.*
