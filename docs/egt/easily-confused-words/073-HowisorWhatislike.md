# How is …? or What is … like?

## How is …?

We use *How is …?* to ask about someone’s general health or about the condition or state of something, or how people experience something:

- A: ***How’s*** *your mother these days?* (How is her general health?)
- B: *Oh, she’s fine, thanks*.
- \[talking about an old house\]
- A: ***How*** *are the walls in the kitchen?* (What is the condition/state of the walls?)
- B: *Well, they need redecorating really*.
- A: ***How’s*** *your new car?*
- B: *Wonderful. It’s so much easier to drive than the old one*.

## What is … like?

We use *What is … like?* to ask for a description of someone or something (e.g. their appearance, their character, their behaviour):

- A: ***What’s*** *her new house* ***like***?
- B: *It’s a modern one, quite big, with a nice garden*.
- A: ***What’s*** *your new teacher* ***like***?
- B: *He’s nice. He’s very good-looking! But he’s quite strict*.

:::warning

We don’t use *How is … like?* to ask for a description of something:

- A: *Have you ever had Korean kimchi?*
- B: *No*. ***What’s*** *it **like**?*
- A: *Well, it’s sort of spicy fermented vegetables, cabbage and things*.
- Not: *~~How is it like?~~*
