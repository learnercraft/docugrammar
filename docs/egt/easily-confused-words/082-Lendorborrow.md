# Lend or borrow?

*Lend* means ‘give something to someone for a short time, expecting that you will get it back’. The past simple and the *\-ed* form are *lent*:

- *I never **lend** my CDs to anyone.*
- *I **lent** Gary £30.* (I expect that Gary will return this to me)

*Borrow* /ˈbɒr.əʊ/ is a regular verb meaning ‘get something from someone, intending to give it back after a short time’:

- *Could I **borrow** your pen for a minute, please?*
- *Laura used to **borrow** money from me all the time.*

## Typical error

When you give something, you *lend* it; when you get or receive something, you *borrow* it:

- *Can I **borrow** your dictionary?*
- Not: *~~Can I lend your dictionary?~~*
