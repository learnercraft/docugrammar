# Less or fewer?

We use the quantifiers *less* and *fewer* to talk about quantities, amounts and degree. *Less* and *fewer* are comparative words. *Less* is the comparative form of *little*. *Fewer* is the comparative form of *few*.

## Less and fewer with a noun

We usually use *less* with uncountable nouns. We use *fewer* with plural nouns:

- *I do **less work** at weekends than I used to.*
- *Better cycle routes would mean **fewer cars** and **fewer accidents**.*

:::warning

You will often hear *less* used with plural countable nouns in informal spoken situations, but traditionally it is not considered to be correct:

- *We’ve got **less** pizzas than we need. There’s ten people and only eight pizzas.* (traditionally correct usage: fewer pizzas)

## Less and fewer with of

When we use *fewer* or *less* before articles (*a/an, the*), demonstratives (*this, that*), possessives (*my, your*) or pronouns (*him, them*), we need to use *of*. We use *less of* with singular nouns and *fewer of* with plural nouns:

- *It was funny to begin with, but as time went on, it became **less of a joke**.*
- *In ten years’ time, more and more people will be demanding information twenty-four hours a day, from all parts of the world. **Fewer of them** will be getting that information from newspapers which arrive hours after the news has occurred.*

## Less and fewer without a noun

We can leave out the noun when it is obvious:

- *Every year in Britain about 5,000 people die on the roads. **Fewer** are killed at work.* (fewer people)
