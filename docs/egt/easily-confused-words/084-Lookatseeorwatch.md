# Look at, see or watch?

## Look at

When we *look at* something, we direct our eyes in its direction and pay attention to it:

- \[the speaker is sitting at her computer\]
- *Come and **look at** this photo Carina sent me.*
- ***Look at*** *the rabbit!*

:::warning

When *look* has an object, it is followed by *at*:

- ***Look at*** *the rain. It’s so heavy.*
- Not: *~~Look the rain~~*.

:::

## See

*See* means noticing something using our eyes. The past simple form is *saw* and the *\-ed* form is *seen*:

- *I **saw** Trevor at the shopping centre yesterday.*
- *Has anyone **seen** my glasses?*

:::note[See also]

- *See*

:::

## Watch as a verb

*Watch* is similar to *look at*, but it usually means that we look at something for a period of time, especially something that is changing or moving:

- *We **watch** television every evening.*
- *I like to sit at the window to **watch** what’s happening in the garden.*

:::warning

We use *see*, not *watch*, when we talk about being at sports matches or public performances, such as films, theatre and dramas. However, we *watch* the television:

- *We **saw** a wonderful new film last night. You’ll have to go and **see** it while it’s in the cinema.*
- Not: *~~We watched~~… ~~You’ll have to go and watch~~* …

When we look at something for a long time, we use *watch*, not *see*.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>We </i><b><i>watched</i></b><i> whales jumping out of the water.</i></td><td><i>Watch</i> focuses on the process of seeing: we spent time looking at the whales.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>We </i><b><i>saw</i></b><i> whales jumping out of the water.</i></td><td><i>See</i> focuses more on the finished event. It doesn’t suggest that we spent much time looking at the whales.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Look at, see or watch: typical errors

When there is an object, we use *at* after *look*:

- *If you go for a walk by the river, you can **look at** the beautiful scenery.*
- Not: … ~~you can look the beautiful scenery~~.

We don’t use *watch* to talk about things that we see without trying:

- *If you go to the forest, you might **see** some deer.*
- Not: … ~~you might watch some deer~~.

We don’t use *watch* when referring to a film in the cinema:

- A: *We’re going to the cinema tonight*.
- B: *What are you going to **see**?*
- (Not: *~~What are you going to watch?~~*)
- A: *I’m not sure. I really want to **see** the new Rocky movie but Nancy said she’s not interested in that*.
- Not: *~~I really want to watch the new Rocky movie~~* …

We use *watch*, not *see*, when we refer to something on the television:

- *At night, I like to **watch** the television.*
- Not: …~~I like to see the television~~.
