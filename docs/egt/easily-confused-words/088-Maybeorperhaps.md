# Maybe or perhaps?

*Maybe* and *perhaps* are adverbs that mean the same thing. We use them when we think something is possible, but we are not certain. We use *maybe* mostly in front or end position whereas *perhaps* is used in front, mid and end position:

- A: *Have you seen my glasses? I can’t find them anywhere*.
- B: ***Maybe*** *you left them at work*.
- A: *Do you think these shoes are too high?*
- B: *They are* ***perhaps***. (it’s possible but I’m not certain)
- *As you **perhaps** remember, I worked as an interpreter for three years in the European Parliament.*
- Not: *~~As you maybe remember~~* …

*Perhaps* is slightly more formal than *maybe*:

- *He was, **perhaps**, a little too smartly dressed for a holidaymaker.*
- ***Maybe*** *I’ll finish work early tomorrow and go shopping with you.*
