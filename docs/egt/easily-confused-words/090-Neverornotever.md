# Never or not … ever?

We can use *not … ever* instead of *never*, but *never* is much more common:

- *She has **never** been a friend of ours.* (or, less common, *She has**n’t*** ***ever** been a friend of ours*.)
- ***Never*** *forget where you came from, your family, your childhood friends.* (or, less common, *Do**n’t*** ***ever** forget where you came from …*)
- A: *Why don’t you go to college and get a degree?*
- B: *I have**n’t** really **ever** thought about it. I’m too old now anyway*. (or, more common, *I’ve **never** really thought about it*.)

:::warning

We don’t use *not … ever* at the beginning of a statement (in front position):

- ***Never*** *had they seen so many strangers in their village all at the same time.*
- Not: *~~Not ever had they seen so many strangers~~* …
