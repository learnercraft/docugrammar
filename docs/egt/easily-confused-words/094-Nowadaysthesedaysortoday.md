# Nowadays, these days or today?

We can use *nowadays, these days* or *today* as adverbs meaning ‘at the present time, in comparison with the past’:

- *I don’t watch TV very much **nowadays**. There’s so much rubbish on. It’s not like it used to be.*
- *Young people **nowadays** don’t respect their teachers any more.*

:::warning

Take care to spell *nowadays* correctly: not ‘nowdays’.

:::

*These days* is more informal:

- ***These days*** *you never see a young person give up their seat for an older person on the bus. That’s what I was taught to do when I was a kid.*
- *Pop singers **these days** don’t seem to last more than a couple of months, then you never hear of them again.*

*Today* is slightly more formal:

- *Apartments **today** are often designed for people with busy lifestyles.*

We can use *today*, but not *nowadays* or *these days*, with the possessive *’s* construction before a noun, or with *of* after a noun. This use is quite formal:

- ***Today’s*** *family structures are quite different from those of 100 years ago.*
- *The youth **of today** have never known what life was like without computers.*

:::warning

We don’t use *nowadays, these days* or *today* as adjectives:

- *Cars **nowadays**/**these days**/**today** are much more efficient and economical.*
- Not: *~~The nowadays cars / The these days cars / The today’s cars~~* …
