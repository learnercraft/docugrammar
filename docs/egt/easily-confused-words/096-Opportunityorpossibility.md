# Opportunity or possibility?

We use *opportunity* to talk about a situation in which we can do something that we want to do. *Opportunity* is most commonly followed by a verb in the *to*\-infinitive form, or *of* + *\-ing* form:

- *I had the **opportunity** to go to university when I was younger but I didn’t. Now I wish I had gone.*
- Not: *~~I had the possibility~~* …
- A: *I’ve been waiting for an **opportunity** to talk to you privately. Are you free now?*
- B: *Yes. What is it about?*
- Not: … ~~waiting for a possibility to~~ …
- *This walk provides the **opportunity** of seeing some beautiful countryside.*

We use *possibility* to talk about something that may happen or be true. *Possibility* is normally followed by *of +* noun phrase or *of + -ing* form, or by a *that*\-clause:

- *I had never even thought of the **possibility** of working in the USA until I was offered a job there in 1998.*
- Not: … ~~the possibility to work in the USA~~ …
- *The **possibility** that there is life on other planets in the universe has always inspired scientists.*

:::warning

We don’t say ‘have the possibility’:

- *I would love to have an **opportunity** to meet the Prime Minister.*
- Not: *~~I would love to have the possibility to meet~~* …
