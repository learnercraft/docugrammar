# Other, others, the other or another?

## Other

*Other* means ‘additional or extra’, or ‘alternative’, or ‘different types of’.

### Other as a determiner

We can use *other* with singular uncountable nouns and with plural nouns:

- *The embassy website has general information about visas. **Other** travel information can be obtained by calling the freephone number.* (additional or extra information)
- *Some music calms people; **other** music has the opposite effect.* (different types of music)
- *What **other** books by Charles Dickens have you read, apart from ‘Oliver Twist’?* (additional or extra books)
- *This one’s too big. Do you have it in **other** sizes?* (alternative sizes)

If we use *other* before a singular countable noun, we must use another determiner before it:

- *I don’t like the red one. I prefer **the*** ***other** colour.*
- Not: *~~I prefer other colour.~~*
- *Jeremy is at university; **our*** ***other** son is still at school.*
- *He got 100% in the final examination. **No*** ***other** student has ever achieved that.*
- *There’s **one*** ***other** thing we need to discuss before we finish.*

- *Mandy and Charlotte stayed behind. The **other** girls went home.*
- Not: *~~The others girls~~* …

We can use *other* as a pronoun. As a pronoun, *other* has a plural form, *others*:

- *We have to solve this problem, more than any **other**, today.*
- *I’ll attach two photos to this email and I’ll send* ***others tomorrow.***

## The other

### The other as a determiner

*The other* with a singular noun means the second of two things or people, or the opposite of a set of two:

- *This computer here is new. **The other** computer is about five years old.*
- A: *D’you know the Indian restaurant in Palmer Street?*
- B: *Yes*.
- A: *Well, the gift shop is on **the*** ***other** side of the street, directly opposite*. (the opposite side)

*The other* with a plural noun means the remaining people or things in a group or set:

- *Joel and Karen are here, but where are **the other** kids?* (the remaining people in a group)
- *Where are **the other** two dinner plates? I can only find four.* (the remaining things in a set – here six plates)

### The other as a pronoun

We can use *the other* as a pronoun, especially to refer back to something which has been mentioned already in the sentence:

- *He had his hat in one hand and a bunch of flowers in **the other**.*
- *She has two kittens, one is black and **the other** is all white.*

## Another

When we use the indefinite article *an* before *other*, we write it as one word: *another*. *Another* means ‘one more’ or ‘an additional or extra’, or ‘an alternative or different’.

### Another as a determiner

We use *another* with singular nouns:

- *Would you like **another** cup of coffee?*
- *You’ve met Linda, but I have **another** sister who you haven’t met, called Margaret.*

## Other, others, the other or another: typical errors

When *other* is a determiner, it does not have a plural form:

- *These boxes are for books. The **other** boxes are for clothes.*
- Not: *~~The others boxes~~* …

When *other* as a pronoun refers to more than one person or thing, it takes the plural form, *others*:

- *Some scientists think we should reduce the number of flights to prevent global warming; **others** disagree.*
- Not: … ~~other disagree~~.

*Other* must have a determiner before it when it comes in front of a singular countable noun. If the noun is indefinite (e.g. *a* *book, a woman, an idea*), we use *another*:

- *I’ve posted the first package. What shall I do with **that other** package?*
- Not: *~~What shall I do with other package?~~*
- *After a month in Bolivia, I was ready to move to **another** country.*
- Not: … ~~to move to other country~~.

We write *another* as one word:

- *There is **another** car park a little further down the same street.*
- Not: *~~There is an other car park~~* …

*Another* is singular. We don’t use it with plural nouns:

- ***Other*** *interesting places to visit include the old harbour and the castle.*
- Not: *~~Another interesting places to visit~~* …
