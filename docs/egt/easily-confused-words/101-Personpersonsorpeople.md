# Person, persons or people?

We use *person* in the singular to refer to any human being:

- *Joel is such a nice **person**.*
- *She's a **person** I have a lot of respect for.*

*Persons* (plural) is a very formal word. We only use it in rather legalistic contexts:

- [notice in a lift]  
*Any person or **persons** found in possession of illegal substances will be prosecuted.*

To refer to groups of human beings or humans in general, we use *people*:

- *I saw three **people** standing on the corner.*
- Not: *~~I saw three **persons** ...~~*
- *Jim and Wendy are such nice **people**.*
- ***People** are generally very selfish.*
- *Three **people** were interviewed for the job, but only one person had the right qualifications and experience.*
