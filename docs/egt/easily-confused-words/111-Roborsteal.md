# Rob or steal?

*Rob* and *steal* both mean 'take something from someone without permission'.

*Rob* focuses on the place or person from which the thing is taken:

- *The gang **robbed** three banks over a period of six months, but were finally caught.*
- *Our local post office **was robbed** early on Tuesday morning.*
- *A young woman **was** attacked and **robbed** as she walked home from work last night.*

:::warning

When we are talking about a house, we use *burgle*:

- *The house **was burgled** while they were all sleeping.*
- Not: *~~The house was robbed ...~~*

:::

*Steal* focuses on the thing that is taken:

- *The thieves entered the museum through the roof and **stole** three paintings worth more than two million euros.*
- *Our car **was stolen** from outside our house last week.*

:::warning

We usually don't say *rob* + object stolen:

- *He **stole** my wallet.*
- Not: *~~He robbed my wallet.~~*
