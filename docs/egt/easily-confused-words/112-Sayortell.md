# Say or tell?

*Say* and *tell* are irregular verbs. The past simple of *say* is *said*, the past simple of *tell* is *told*:

- *They asked if I was looking for work and I **said** yes.*
- *Then he **told** me how he had got the job by lying about his age.*

We use *say* and *tell* in different ways in reported speech. *Say* focuses on the words someone said and *tell* focuses more on the content or message of what someone said:

- *'Hello,' she **said**.*
- Not: *~~'Hello,' she told.~~*
- *She **told** him they were going on holiday.* (The focus is on the information.)

We use *say* with direct speech. We don't normally use *tell* in this way:

- *He **said**, 'I'm not paying Â£50 for that.'*

## Say and tell with objects

Both *say* and *tell* take a direct object. The object is most commonly the reported clause (the report of what someone said).

| reporting clause | reported clause (direct object) |
| -----------------|---------------------------------|
| *She **said***   | *'I don't know what you mean.'* |
| *I **told** her* | *why it had happened.*          |

*Tell* normally takes an indirect object (one or more people = io) and a direct object (the reported clause = do):

- *The boy **told** \[IO\] us \[DO\] he didn't want any money.*

However, we use *tell* without an indirect object with words such as *the truth*, *a lie*, *a jok*, *a story*:

- *You should never **tell** a lie.*
- Not: *~~... say a lie.~~*
- *Come on Kevin. You're good at **telling** jokes.*

*Say* does not take an indirect object. Instead, we use a phrase with *to*:

- *And then she **said** to me, 'I'm your cousin. We've never met before.'*
- Not: *~~And then she said me ...~~*

## *Tell* + indirect object + *to*-infinitive

We use *tell* with an indirect object and a *to*-infinitive to report a command or an instruction. We don't normally use *say* in this way:

- *They **told us to come** back the next day.*
- Not: *~~They said us to come ...~~*
- *They **told her to wait** till the doctor arrived.*

**Spoken English:**  
But in informal speaking, we sometimes use *say* + *to*-infinitive to report a command or an instruction:

- *I asked him if he wanted it today but he **said to leave** it till tomorrow.*

### Typical errors

- We don't use an indirect object with *say*:
  - *'I'm in a hurry,' he **said to me**.*
  - Not: .~~.. he said me.~~

- We don't use *tell* without an indirect object when we report someone's words:
  - *Then a loud voice **said**, 'Hello.'*
  - Not: *~~... a loud voice told, 'Hello.'~~*
  - *She **said** she would wait for us outside.*
  - Not: *~~She told she would wait ...~~*
