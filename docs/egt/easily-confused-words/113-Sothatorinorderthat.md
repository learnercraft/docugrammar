# So that or in order that?

We use *so that* and *in order that* to talk about purpose. We often use them with modal verbs (*can, would, will*, etc.). *So that* is far more common than *in order that*, and *in order that* is more formal:

- *I'll go by car **so that** I can take more luggage.*
- *We left a message with his neighbour **so that** he would know we'd called.*
- \[on a website\] ***In order that** you can sign the form, please print it out and mail it to this address.*

We often leave out *that* after *so* in informal situations:

- *I've made some sandwiches **so** (**that**) we can have a snack on the way.*

When referring to the future, we can use the present simple or *will/'ll* after *so that*. We usually use the present simple after *in order that* to talk about the future:

- *I'll post the CD today **so that** you get it by the weekend.* (or *... **so that** you will get it ...*)
- *We will send you a reminder **in order that** you arrive on time for your appointment.* (or *... **so that** you arrive on time ...* ``or`` *... **so that** you'll arrive on time ...*)

*So that* (but not *in order that*) can also mean 'with the result that':

- *The birds return every year around March, **so that** April is a good time to see them.*
