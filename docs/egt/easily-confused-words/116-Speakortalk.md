# Speak or talk?

## Speak and talk: uses

The verbs *speak* and *talk* both generally mean 'say words', but there are some small differences in how they are used. *Speak* is more formal than *talk*.

Compare

| Sentence | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- |
| *I need to **speak** to you.* | Formal. It is possible that:<br/>1. the speaker does not know you very well.<br/>2. this is in a formal setting, such as work.<br/>3. what the person has to say is important/serious. |
| *I need to **talk** to you.* | Informal. It is possible that:<br/>1. the speaker is your friend.<br/>2. the speaker is someone you don't know very well, but what they have to say is informal. |

We usually use *speak* for more formal presentations and lectures, and *talk* for more informal ones:

- *Dr Graham Foster will **speak** about the history of the region.*
- *Kyle is going to **talk** us through the benefits of the software and then Liz will **talk** about the marketing plan.*

When we refer to languages, we use *speak*:

- *How many languages do you **speak**?*
- Not: *~~How many languages do you talk?~~*
- *I wish I could **speak** Italian.*
- Not: *~~... talk Italian.~~*

*Speak* usually only focuses on the person who is producing the words:

- *He **spoke** about the importance of taking exercise and having a good diet.*

*Talk* focuses on a speaker and at least one listener, and can mean 'have a conversation':

- *I hope I can meet you to **talk** about my plans for the company.*
- Not: *~~I hope I can meet you to speak about my plans ...~~*

Compare

| Sentence | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- |
| *He always looks down when he is **speaking**.* | The focus is on his use of his voice to produce words. *Speak* focuses only on the person who is producing the words. |
| *I was **talking** to Maria yesterday.* | The focus is on the use of words as part of a conversation with someone else. |

We use *speak* on the telephone:

- A: *Is Rita there?*  
  B: *Who's **speaking**?*  
  A: *My name's Anna. I work with her*.
- Not: *~~Who's talking?~~*
- *Hello, can I **speak** to Laura, please?*

## *Speak* and *talk* with prepositions

We usually use *to* after *speak* and *talk*. In more formal situations, people sometimes use *with*:

- *I need to **speak to** you about this conference next week.*
- *I was **talking to** Richard Moss the other day about the golf club.*
- *May I **speak with** you for a moment?* (rather formal)

### Typical errors

- We don't use *talk* when referring to foreign languages:
  - *I can **speak** German and Spanish.*
  - Not: *~~I can talk German and Spanish.~~*

- We don't use *speak* to focus on conversation:
  - *They can **talk** and get to know each other over dinner.*
  - Not: *~~They can speak and get to know each other ...~~*
