# Such or so?

*Such* is a determiner; *so* is an adverb. They often have the same meaning of 'very' or 'to this degree':

- *Those are **such** good chocolates.*
- *Those chocolates are **so** good.*

We use *such* + noun phrase and *so* + adjective or adverb phrase:

- *She is **such** a great cook.*
- Not: *~~She is so great cook.~~*
- *That was **so** unpleasant.* (*so* + adjective)
- Not: *~~That was such unpleasant.~~*
- *Why do you drive **so** fast?* (*so* + adverb)
- Not: *~~Why do you drive such fast?~~*

Compare

| *so* + adjective | *such* + noun phrase |
| --- |  --- |
| *You're **so** kind*. | *He's **such** a kind person* |
| *It was **so** hot we couldn't work*. | *November was **such** a cold month*. |

*So* but not *such* can also be used in front of *much, many, little, few* to add emphasis:

- ***So** much food was wasted every day.*
- Not: *~~Such much food was wasted ...~~*
- *In those days there were **so** few doctors in our area.*
- Not: *~~... there were such few doctors ...~~*
