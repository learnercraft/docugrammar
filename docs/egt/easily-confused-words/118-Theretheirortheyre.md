# There, their or theyâ€™re?

*There*, *their* and *they're* are commonly confused in English, as they sound the same.

*There* is an adverb which refers to places:

- *The shop you need is over **there**.*

We also use *there* to say that something exists:

- ***There** is a large oak tree outside the hotel.*

*Their* is a possessive determiner which means 'belonging to them':

- ***Their** house is very small, isn't it?*

*They're* is a shortened form of 'they are':

- ***They're** too young to have a holiday so far away from home.*
