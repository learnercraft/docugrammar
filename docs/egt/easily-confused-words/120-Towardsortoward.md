# Towards or toward?

*Towards* and *toward* are prepositions. We can use both forms, but *towards* is much more common than *toward*.

*Toward(s*) most often means 'in the direction of something':

- *The oil pollution is now moving **towards** the shore, and could threaten beaches and wild life.*
- *He stood up and moved **toward** the door.*

We use *toward(s*) to mean 'in relation to someone or something'. We don't use *against* or *about* when we talk about people's attitudes, feelings and behaviour in relation to one another:

- *She's always been very friendly **towards** me.*
- *He felt very angry **towards** her when she refused him.*
- Not: *~~... angry against her ...~~ or ~~... angry about her ...~~*

## *Toward(s*): position

We use *toward(s*) to mean 'near to or just before a time or place':

- ***Toward** the late afternoon I always get sleepy and can't work so well.*
- *We sat **towards** the back of the room but we could still hear the speakers very clearly.*

## *Toward(s*): purpose

*Toward(s*) can mean 'for the purpose of buying or achieving something':

- *Would you like to make a contribution **towards** our new children's playground?* (Would you like to give some money to help pay for it?)
- *The essays you do during term count **towards** your final grade.*
