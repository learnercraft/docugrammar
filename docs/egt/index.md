## Introduction

*English Grammar Today* is an up-to-date guide to the grammar of modern English. It is useful for all users of English but in particular for learners of English at an intermediate to upper-intermediate level (CEF B1–C1). It will also be helpful to teachers of English looking for clear explanations and real examples.

*English Grammar Today* is a reference book with accompanying CD-ROM. Together they provide a range of grammatical explanations from basic points, such as how we form questions in English, to more advanced points, such as how to use particular words and phrases to apologise, to address people, to be polite, to agree with others or to respond to what is said. They include key features of grammar, such as adjective, adverb, noun, determiner, ellipsis, main clause, future, conjunction, as well as individual words and pairs of words which are commonly confused, such as above/over and make/do.

The book and CD-ROM also cover more general topics, such as slang, dialect, formality, spelling and punctuation, abbreviations, geographical names and telling the time.

The emphasis is on standard modern British English although it does discuss some differences between British and American English and contains valuable information about American English.

*English Grammar Today* contains a lot of information about the grammar of spoken English and the CD-ROM enables you to listen to all the examples of sentences and dialogues from the book. We think it is important to hear as well as read grammar.

As well as almost 400 main sections in the book there are an additional 197 sections on the CD-ROM.

There is also an *English Grammar Today* Workbook which contains a range of tasks and exercises (with answers) which help you to practise the most important features of grammar and usage covered in *English Grammar Today*.
