# Comparison: nouns (more money, the most points)

## More, less and fewer

We can use *more*, *less* and *fewer* with noun phrases to create comparisons which are similar to the comparative forms of adjectives and adverbs:

- *There was **more snow** this year than last year.*
- *She has **more problems** than most people.*
- *You should eat **less junk food** and start to take better care of your health.*
- *There are **fewer birds** in the countryside now than there were 30 years ago.*

Traditionally, we use *less* with uncountable nouns and *fewer* with plural countable nouns. Nowadays, many people use *less* with plural countable nouns. Some people consider this to be incorrect, and prefer to use *fewer*:

- *I think the room would look better with **less furniture**.* (*less* + singular uncountable noun)
- *There were **fewer cars** on the roads twenty years ago.* (fewer + plural countable noun; traditional correct form)
- ***Less kids*** *take music lessons now than before.* (less + plural countable noun; considered incorrect by some people)

:::warning

We use *more* + noun phrase, not *much* + noun phrase, to make a comparison:

- *Footballers earn **more money** than other sportsmen.*
- Not: … ~~much money than other sportsmen~~

## More and more, less and less, fewer and fewer

We can use *more and more, less and less* and *fewer and fewer* in noun phrases to refer to things which increase or decrease over time:

- *There are **more and more** low-quality reality shows on TV.*
- *I seem to have **less and less** time to myself these days.*
- *She visited her family on **fewer and fewer** occasions, till soon she stopped seeing them altogether.*

## Most, least and fewest

We can use *most, least* and *fewest* with noun phrases to create comparisons which are similar to the superlative forms of adjectives and adverbs. It is more common to use *the* before *most, least* and *fewest*, but we can also leave it out:

- *The points are added up, and the team with **the most points** wins.*
- *Who got **most votes** in the election?*
- *The room that has **the least furniture** would be best for dancing.*
- *The class with **the fewest students** was always Miss Murray’s philosophy seminar.*

Traditionally, we use *least* with singular uncountable nouns and *fewest* with plural countable nouns. Nowadays, many people use *least* with plural countable nouns. Some people consider this to be incorrect, and prefer to use *fewest*:

- *Which horse eats **the least food**? That’s the one I’ll buy!* (*least* + singular uncountable noun)
- *Of all the models we tested, the B226X had **the fewest faults**.* (*fewest* + plural countable noun; traditional correct form)
- *Of the three cities, I’d say Limerick gets **the least tourists**.* (*least* + plural countable noun; considered incorrect by some people)
