# Gender

Some languages mark words according to whether they are masculine, feminine or neuter. In English, we do not commonly mark nouns according to gender.

However, we use pronouns and possessive determiners to show gender (for example, *he, she, it, his, hers*):

- ***She****’s selling **her** house.*

Some nouns which refer to living things can be marked for gender (e.g. *actress*, *heroine*). Some people may consider such words to be dated.

More commonly, words such as *actor* are used to refer to both male and female. Some nouns which used to end in -*man* are now neutral and are used to include both genders:

- *chair* (preferred to *chairman*)
- *flight attendant* (preferred to *steward* and *stewardess*)
- *spokesperson* (preferred to *spokesman*)

The title *Ms* is preferred to *Mrs* (married woman) or *Miss* (unmarried woman) so that we cannot tell whether the woman is married or not.

We give some animals male and female words:

- tiger–tigress
- dog–bitch

We can use the pronoun *it* to refer to very small children and babies when we speak generally about them, or when we do not know their gender. We also use *it* to refer to animals when they’re not pets or when we don’t know them personally:

- *The baby in the flat next door is always awake and **it** just never seems to stop crying.*
