# Opinion

We use *opinion* as a noun to mean beliefs or judgements about someone or something. When it refers to the beliefs or judgements of individuals, it is countable:

- *I’ve never agreed with Chris’s **opinion** on taxation.*
- *A lot of people have strong **opinions** about bullfighting.* (referring to their individual opinions)

When it refers to the beliefs or judgements of a group of people, *opinion* is usually uncountable:

- *The government is worried about public **opinion**.*

We use phrases such as *in my opinion*, *in* *your opinion*, *in Peter’s* *opinion* to show whose opinion we are referring to:

- ***In Maria’s opinion****, we paid too much.*

We often introduce ideas, especially in writing, with the phrase *in my opinion*:

- ***In my opinion****, there are too many cars on the road with just one person in them.*
- Not: *~~On my opinion/To my opinion/According to me/In my point of view~~*

:::warning

We don’t use *in my opinion* and *I think* together:

- ***In my opinion****, she’s wasting her time.*
- Not: *~~In my opinion I think she’s wasting her time~~*.

:::

The phrases *It is my opinion that* … and *I am of the opinion that* … are more formal:

- ***It is my opinion that*** *everyone should have free healthcare.*
- ***I am of the opinion that*** *the Prime Minister should resign.*

- *According to*
