# Determiners (the, my, some, this)

Determiners are words such as *the, my, this, some, twenty, each, any*, which are used before nouns:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>the</i></b><i> countryside</i></td><td><b><i>some</i></b><i> paper</i></td><td><b><i>this</i></b><i> old sofa</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>my</i></b><i> father</i></td><td><b><i>five</i></b><i> green chairs</i></td><td><b><i>each</i></b><i> person</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

Determiners include the following common types:

- Articles: a/an, the
- Demonstratives: this, that, these, those
- Possessives: my, your, his, her, its, our, their, x’s (possessive ’s)
- Quantifiers: (a) few, fewer, (a) little, many, much, more, most, some, any, etc.
- Numbers: one, two, three, etc.

Here is a list of the determiners included in this book. Many of them have individual entries:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>(a) few, fewer, fewest</i></td><td><i>every</i></td><td><i>most</i></td><td><i>that</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>(a) little</i></td><td><i>half</i></td><td><i>much</i></td><td><i>the</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>(an)other</i></td><td><i>her</i></td><td><i>my</i></td><td><i>their</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>a/an</i></td><td><i>his</i></td><td><i>neither</i></td><td><i>these</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>all</i></td><td><i>its</i></td><td><i>no</i></td><td><i>this</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>any</i></td><td><i>Jim’s</i>, <i>Anna’s</i>, etc.</td><td><i>one</i>, <i>two</i>, <i>three</i>, etc.</td><td><i>those</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>both</i></td><td><i>least</i></td><td><i>our</i></td><td><i>what</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>each</i></td><td><i>less</i></td><td><i>several</i></td><td><i>which</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>either</i></td><td><i>many</i></td><td><i>some</i></td><td><i>whose</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>enough</i></td><td><i>more</i></td><td><i>such</i></td><td><i>your</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

Sometimes we don’t use a determiner before the noun. We call this ‘zero determiner’:

- ***Dogs*** *love **biscuits**.*

- *A/an* and *the*

## What do determiners do?

Determiners have two main functions: referring and quantifying.

### Referring

Referring means showing us who or what the noun is pointing to or talking about. The most common types of determiners which we use for referring are articles, possessives and demonstratives:

- A: *Where’s **the** newspaper?*
- B: *It’s on **the** sofa*. (*the* means the noun refers to something the speaker and listener both know or are familiar with)
- A: *Have you seen **my** MP3 player anywhere?*
- B: *Yes. It’s on **the** kitchen table*. (*my* refers to something which belongs to the speaker; *the* refers to something the speaker and listener can both identify because they both know or share knowledge about it.)
- *Do you want **this** bag or are you going to put it in **that** box?* (*this* refers to something near the speaker; *that* refers to something further away.)
- *Charles is looking for **his** dictionary. Have you got it?* (*his* means the noun refers to something belonging to a male, in this case, *Charles*.)

### Quantifying

‘Quantifying’ means showing how much of something there is, or how many:

- ***Five*** *people were arrested during an anti-war demonstration in London today.*
- *There are **some** letters here for you.* (*some* means a non-specific, small number or quantity of something.)
- *Do you have **enough** flour to make the bread.* (*enough* means a quantity that is sufficient or adequate for something).
