# Whole

*Whole* is a determiner. We use *whole* before nouns and after other determiners (*my, the, a/an, their*) to talk about quantity. We use it to describe the completeness of something:

- *I’ve wanted to be an actor my **whole** life.*
- *Please can you check the **whole** document?*
- *I thought the **whole** experience was very interesting.*

We use *the whole of* when *whole* is followed by another determiner (*my, her, this, the*):

- *She had been in the same job for **the*** ***whole*** ***of** her life.* (or *… for her **whole** life*.)

We often use *the whole of* with periods of time to emphasise duration:

- *At dawn, he would finally fall into bed and stay there **the whole of** the next day.*

We also use *whole* as an adverb:

- *He took the cake and swallowed it **whole**.*
