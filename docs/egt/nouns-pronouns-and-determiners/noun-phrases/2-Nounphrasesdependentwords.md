# Noun phrases: dependent words

In a noun phrase, dependent words before the head are either determiners (e.g. *the, my, some*) or premodifiers (e.g. adjectives). Dependent words after the head are either complements or postmodifiers.

## Noun phrases: determiners (a, the, my, his, some, this, etc.)

Determiners come first in a noun phrase (e.g. ***the*** *big black car*). They include:

- articles: *a/an, the*
- demonstratives: *this, that, these, those*
- possessive determiners: *my, your, his, her*, etc.
- quantifiers: *some, any, all, enough, no*, *every*, etc.
- numerals: *one, two, three*, etc.
- interrogative words: *which, what, whose*

Determiners show the type of reference the noun phrase makes. The reference may be definite (*the*), indefinite (*a/an*), demonstrative (*this, that, these, those*), possessive (*my, our, their*, etc.). Determiners can also indicate number or quantity (e.g. *seven, all, some, no*). (Determiners are in bold; heads are underlined.):

- ***This*** room *is **the** guest* bedroom*.*
- ***Your*** sister *rang while you were at* ***the*** shop*.*
- ***Every*** time *I see him he’s wearing* ***no*** shoes*.*
- ***Which*** box *do you want?*

## Noun phrases: premodifiers (big, good, red)

Premodifiers consist of single adjectives, adjective phrases, single nouns and noun phrases which are used before the head in a noun phrase.

### Adjective premodifiers

Adjectives describe the qualities or features of a noun. Common adjectives include *nice, big, bad, happy, black, beautiful, new*. (Adjectives and adjective phrases are in bold; heads are underlined.):

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>a </i><b><i>nice</i></b><i> </i>day</td><td><i>my </i><b><i>new</i></b><i> </i>armchair</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>a </i><b><i>very happy</i></b><i> </i>life</td><td><i>that </i><b><i>big, black</i></b><i> </i>umbrella</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Nouns acting as premodifiers

Nouns can act as premodifiers in noun phrases. They specify particular aspects or features of the noun, such as type, material, etc. (Premodifier nouns are in bold; heads are underlined.):

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>a </i><b><i>university</i></b><i> </i>education</td><td><i>two </i><b><i>18th-century solid silver</i></b><i> </i>cups</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>a </i><b><i>fur</i></b><i> </i>coat</td><td><i>the </i><b><i>post-war</i></b><i> </i>economy</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>a recent </i><b><i>government</i></b><i> </i>report</td><td><br/></td></tr></tbody></table>

Nouns which act as premodifiers are singular, even when the head is plural:

- *Four* ***metal*** cylinders *were attached to the machine.*
- Not: *~~Four metals cylinders were attached to the machine.~~*
- *You can get really good, cheap* ***leather*** jackets *in Marrakesh.*

Noun phrase modifiers indicating time or measurements are singular in form even when their meaning is plural. Hyphens are normally used in the modifying expression:

- *an* ***eight-hour*** flight *a* ***three-day*** tour *of Amsterdam a* ***two-litre*** bottle
- Not: *~~an eight-hours flight~~*

## Noun phrases: complements

Complements come immediately after the head in a noun phrase. They are prepositional phrases or clauses which are necessary to complete the meaning of the noun. Without the complement, we wouldn’t understand what the noun was referring to.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>pre-head</td><td>head</td><td>complement</td><td>type</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>a</i></td><td><i>rise</i></td><td><i>in inflation</i></td><td>prepositional phrase</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>a</i></td><td><i>feeling</i></td><td><i>of fear and loneliness</i></td><td>prepositional phrase</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>the</i></td><td><i>idea</i></td><td><i>that schools should control their own finances</i></td><td>clause</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>the</i></td><td><i>fact</i></td><td><i>that the planet is getting warmer</i></td><td>clause</td></tr></tbody></table>

***A rise in inflation*** *is likely in the coming months.*

***The idea that schools should control their own finances*** *is not a new one.*

***The fact that the planet is getting warmer*** *is no longer disputed.*

## Noun phrases: postmodifiers

Postmodifiers come after the head in a noun phrase. They consist of adverb phrases, prepositional phrases and clauses. Postmodifiers give extra or specific information about the noun (e.g. place, possession, identifying features). Unlike complements, they are not necessary to complete the meaning.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>pre-head</td><td>head</td><td>postmodifier</td><td>type</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>an old</i></td><td><i>cottage</i></td><td><i>nearby</i></td><td>adverb phrase</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>a tall</i></td><td><i>man</i></td><td><i>with grey hair</i></td><td>prepositional phrase</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>that antique</i></td><td><i>table</i></td><td><i>she bought last year</i></td><td>clause</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>the</i></td><td><i>parcel</i></td><td><i>on my desk that Philip left for you</i></td><td>prepositional phrase (on my desk) + clause (that Philip left for you)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>the</i></td><td><i>woman</i></td><td><i>in the black dress talking to Marcus</i></td><td>prepositional phrase (in the black dress) + clause (talking to Marcus)</td></tr></tbody></table>

Postmodifiers usually come after any complement in the noun phrase.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>pre-head</td><td>head</td><td>complement</td><td>postmodifier</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>the</i></td><td><i>claim</i></td><td><i>that he was a car thief</i></td><td><i>which appeared in several newspapers</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>a</i></td><td><i>feeling</i></td><td><i>of hope</i></td><td><i>that everyone shared</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Noun phrases: complements or postmodifiers?

Complements are necessary to complete the meaning of a noun. Postmodifiers are not necessary; they give extra information about the noun which helps to identify it or locate it in some way. (The complement and the postmodifier are underlined below.)

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>complement</td><td>postmodifier</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>We all felt a </i><b><i>sense</i></b><i> </i>of despair<i>.</i></td><td><i>The tall </i><b><i>woman</i></b><i> </i>in the red skirt talking to Paula<i> is a colleague of mine.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>The head <i>sense</i> needs more information to complete its meaning. If we only said <i>We all felt a sense</i>, the meaning would not be complete; we need the complement.</td><td>The postmodifiers <i>in the red skirt</i> and <i>talking to Paula</i> help us to identify the woman but they are not necessary. The meaning (<i>The tall woman is a colleague of mine</i>.) would be complete without them.</td></tr></tbody></table>
