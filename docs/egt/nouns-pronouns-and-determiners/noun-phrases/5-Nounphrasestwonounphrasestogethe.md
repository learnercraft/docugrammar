# Noun phrases: two noun phrases together

We can put two noun phrases (np) together to refer to the same person or thing. This is called apposition:

- *I report to \[NP1\] **Frank Stein**, \[NP2\] **Vice-president of marketing**, with whom I meet weekly.*
- *\[NP1\] **John Tebbitt**, \[NP2\] **a newcomer*** ***to marathons**, ran a very good race.*

### Punctuation

Noun phrases in apposition are normally separated by commas in writing (see the examples above). Where the second noun phrase identifies the first, commas are not necessary:

- *\[NP1\] **My brother** \[NP2\] **Roger** lives in New Zealand but \[NP1\] **my brother** \[NP2\] **Kevin** never left home.*
- (*Roger* and *Kevin* identify which brothers the speaker or writer is referring to.)
