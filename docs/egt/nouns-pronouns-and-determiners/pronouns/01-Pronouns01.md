# Pronouns

We use pronouns in place of nouns and noun phrases:

- *The children were in the garden. **They** were getting wet.*
- \[pointing to a parcel\]
- A: *What’s in **that**?*
- B: ***I*** *don’t know*. ***It****’s for* ***you***.
- ***You*** *don’t need to make **me** a cup of tea. **I**’ll do **it*** ***myself**.*

Pronouns can also act as the head of noun phrases, with pre- and postmodifiers and complements:

- A: *Did you mean you think she’s wrong?*
- B: *Yes, I meant* ***just*** ***that***. (premodified pronoun)
- *I made cakes and she ate **them*** ***all**.* (postmodified pronoun)
- *We’re looking for **someone*** ***young and energetic**.* (pronoun and complement)

There are different types of pronouns.

## Determiners used as pronouns

Some determiners can also be used as pronouns (i.e. without a noun following and when the meaning is clear without including the noun):

- A: *Have you read any poems by Lorca?*
- B: *Yes. I’ve read* ***a few***.
