# Pronouns: indefinite (-body, -one, -thing, -where)

*Somebody, anyone, everything*, etc. are indefinite pronouns.

We use *\-body, -one, -thing, -where* to refer to people, places and things in a general way. We write them as one single word, apart from *no one*, which can be written as two separate words or with a hyphen (*no-one*).

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>somebody</i></td><td><i>someone</i></td><td><i>something</i></td><td><i>somewhere</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>anybody</i></td><td><i>anyone</i></td><td><i>anything</i></td><td><i>anywhere</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>nobody</i></td><td><i>no one</i></td><td><i>nothing</i></td><td><i>nowhere</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>everybody</i></td><td><i>everyone</i></td><td><i>everything</i></td><td><i>everywhere</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

The differences in their meanings are the same as the differences between *some, any, every* and *no*. We use them all with a singular verb:

- *Is **anyone** helping Claire with the washing up?*
- ***Everybody*** *makes mistakes.*
- *I’m looking for **somewhere** I can store my bike.*

## \-body and -one

\-*body* and -*one* mean the same thing. In informal contexts, we use indefinite pronouns ending in -*body* more often than pronouns ending in -*one*. The forms with -*one* are more common in formal writing:

- ***Nobody*** *was interested in the talk.* (or *No one was* *…*)
- ***Everyone*** *started to clap.* (or *Everybody …*)

## Somewhere nice, nothing much

We can add an adjective or adverbial expression to these indefinite pronouns to make them more specific:

- A: *What did you do at the weekend?*
- B: ***Nothing much***.
- *Are you thinking of **anyone*** ***in particular**?*
- *Is there **something else** I can do to help?*
