# Pronouns: one, you, we, they

*One, you, we* and *they* are generic personal pronouns. We can use *one, you, we* and *they* to refer to ‘people in general’.

## One, you and we

We can use *one*, *you* or *we* when we are making generalisations and not referring to any one person in particular. When used like this, *one, you* and *we* can include the speaker or writer:

- ***One*** *can use the Internet without understanding cookies.* (or ***You*** *can use …* or ***We*** *can use …*)
- ***You*** *usually need a raincoat in Ireland. It rains a lot.*
- ***We*** *tend to avoid talking about money.*

*One* is much more formal than *you* or *we*, and is rare in speaking:

- ***One*** *would have thought that agreement could be reached easily on that matter.*

We can use *one’s* before a noun as a possessive determiner:

- *Conversations with **one’s** children are extremely predictable, especially as they hit adolescence.*

## They

We can use *they* to talk about a wide group of people, such as an authority or an institution. In such cases, *they* does not refer to specific people:

- ***They****’re chopping down the rainforests.*
- ***They****’ve opened a new cinema in the town centre.*
- ***They*** *started running yoga classes at the school.*

We use *they* and *them* to refer back to the indefinite pronouns *someone, anyone, everyone* (underlined below) when we do not know the number or gender. We also use *they* and *them* in question tags:

- *If* someone *comes with a parcel for me, can you ask **them** to take it next door.*
- *I believe* anyone *can do anything if **they** really want to enough, can’t **they**?*
