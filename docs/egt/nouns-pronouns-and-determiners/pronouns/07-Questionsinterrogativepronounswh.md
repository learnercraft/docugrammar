# Questions: interrogative pronouns (what, who)

We use interrogative pronouns to ask questions. They are: *who, which, whom, what* and *whose*. These are also known as *wh-*words. Questions using these are called *wh-*questions:

- ***Who*** *called last night?*
- ***Which*** *keys are yours?*
- ***Whom*** *do I ask for at the desk?*
- ***What*** *did you do when the electricity failed?*
- ***Whose*** *watch is this?*

## Interrogative pronouns: uses

We use *who* and *whom* on their own:

- ***Who*** *paid?*
- ***Whom*** *did you speak to?*

We can use *whose*, *which* and *what* either on their own (as pronouns) or with a noun head (underlined):

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>As pronouns</td><td>With a noun head</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>Whose</i></b><i> are these books?</i></td><td><b><i>Whose</i></b><i> </i>books<i> are these?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>Which</i></b><i> did you buy?</i></td><td><b><i>Which</i></b><i> </i>sweater<i> did you buy?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>What</i></b><i> is the number on the door?</i></td><td><b><i>What</i></b><i> </i>number<i> is your house?</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

We can use *who, whose, which* and *what* both as subject and object:

- ***Who*** *is the best footballer in the world?* (*who* as subject)
- ***Who*** *did you meet?* (*who* as object)
- ***What*** *happened next?* (*what* as subject)
- ***What*** *did you buy?* (*what* as object)

### Who or whom?

:::warning

We use *whom* as an object in formal styles. When we use a preposition before *whom*, it is even more formal. We don’t normally use it in speaking:

- ***Whom*** *did you give the book to?* (formal)
- ***To whom*** *did you give the book?* (very formal) Or, less formally: ***Who*** *did you give the book to?*

### What or which?

We use *what* when we ask about specific information from a general range of possible answers:

- ***What****’s the tallest building in the world?*
- ***What*** *did you say? I couldn’t hear you.*
- ***What****’s your address?*

We use *which* when we ask for specific information from a restricted range of possible answers:

- \[looking at a list of addresses\]
- A: ***Which*** *is your address?*
- B: *This one here*.
- ***Which*** *hand do you write with?*

- \[looking at a photograph of three women\]
- ***Which*** *one is your sister?*

- ***Which*** *airport do we leave from, Heathrow or Gatwick?*
