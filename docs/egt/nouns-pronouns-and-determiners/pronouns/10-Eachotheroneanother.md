# Each other, one another

We use *each other* and *one another* to show that each person in a group of two or more people does something to the others. There is very little difference between *each other* and *one another* and we can normally use them in the same places. *Each other* is more common than *one another*:

- *Rick and Gina never liked **each other**.* (Rick never liked Gina and Gina never liked Rick.)
- *Everyone in the family gave **each other** presents.* (Each member of the family gave each member of the family a present.)

- A: *How’s Maria? Do you see her often?*
- B: *She’s great. We phone **each other**/**one another** regularly*.

We use *each other’s* and *one another’s* as possessive determiners:

- *Lisa and Kate hated **each other’s** husbands.* (Lisa hated Kate’s husband and Kate hated Lisa’s husband.)
- *My friend Olivia and I know very little about **one another’s** work.*

## Typical errors

Be careful not to use *us* or *ourselves* instead of *each other*/*one another*:

- *We’ve known **each other**/**one another** for twelve years.*
- Not: *~~We’ve known us for twelve years~~ or ~~We’ve known ourselves~~* …

:::note[See also]

- Pronouns: reflexive (*myself*, *themselves*, etc.)

:::

We write *each other* as two separate words and we do not use a hyphen (-):

- *We got to know **each other** very quickly.*
- Not: *~~We got to know eachother~~*

We don’t use *each other* or *one another* as a plural form:

- *They love **each other**.*
- Not: *~~They love each others.~~*
