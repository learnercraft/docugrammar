# Everyone, everybody, everything, everywhere

*Everyone*, *everybody*, *everything* and *everywhere* are indefinite pronouns.

We use them to refer to a total number of people, things and places. We write them as one word:

- *His name was Henry but **everyone** called him Harry.*
- *All your clothes are clean. I washed **everything** yesterday.*
- *The sand got **everywhere**, into eyes, hair, tents, cups of tea, camera lenses.*

We use *everyone*, *everybody*, *everything* and *everywhere* with singular verbs:

- ***Everybody*** *knows the truth.*
- *At night, with the lights shining on the water, **everything** looks different.*
- *We couldn’t get a seat. **Everywhere** was so crowded.*

:::warning

We don’t add *s* to *everything* to make it plural:

- *Children can buy **everything** they want.*
- Not: *~~Children can buy everythings they want~~*.

:::

When we want to refer back to *everyone* or *everybody* and we don’t know if everyone is male or female, we use *him or her* and *his or her*. In informal styles, we use plural pronouns *they, their* and *them*:

- ***Everybody*** *has a team leader in charge of him or her.*
- ***Not everyone*** *has his or her own desk.*
- ***Everyone*** *has to climb to the top. When they get to the top, they have to blow their whistle.* (more informal)
- *Has **everyone** got their coats?* (more informal)

We can use *everybody* and *everyone* as the subject of imperative clauses. We use the base form of the verb:

- ***Everybody*** *stand up!*

### Everyone and everybody

*Everyone* and *everybody* mean the same. *Everyone* is a little more formal than *everybody*. *Everyone* is used more in writing than *everybody*:

- *She knew **everybody** in the room.*
- *Could **everybody** listen for a minute?*
- *When **everyone** had gathered in the garden, Sergeant joined them and said, ‘Welcome, **everyone**!’*

## Typical error

We write *everyone* as one word:

- *Twenty years ago **everyone** used an alarm clock that rang like a bell.* (every person)
- Not: *~~Twenty years ago every one used an alarm clock~~* …

We don’t normally use ‘all people’ to generalise about human beings:

- ***Everyone*** *has a right to basic freedoms.*

- *Every one* or *everyone*?
