# One and one’s

As a personal pronoun (both subject and object), *one* can be used to refer to ‘people in general’. We often use *one* in making generalisations, especially in more formal styles. However, if *one* is used too much, it can make the speaker sound too formal. *One* takes a third person singular verb:

- ***One*** *never knows, does **one**?*
- ***One*** *should not use mobile phones when driving.*
- *Holidays are supposed to allow **one** to forget about work.*

*You* and *they* are also used in a similar way. However, *one* and *you* include the speaker in the generalisation:

- \[a durian is a kind of fruit\]
- *Does **one** eat durian in Malaysia?* (includes the speaker, who is there or has an interest in going there; more formal)
- *Do **you** eat durian in Malaysia?* (less formal)
- *Do **they** eat durian in Malaysia?* (refers to others)

*One’s* is a possessive determiner:

- ***One’s*** *health is much more important than having lots of money.*
