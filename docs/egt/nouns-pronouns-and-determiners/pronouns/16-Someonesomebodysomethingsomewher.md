# Someone, somebody, something, somewhere

*Someone*, *somebody*, *something*, *somewhere* are indefinite pronouns. They function in a similar way to *some*. We use them in affirmative clauses and in questions expecting a particular answer. We can use them to refer to both general and specific people or things. We use them with a singular verb:

- *I know **someone** who gives piano lessons.* (a specific person)
- ***Somebody*** *has obviously made a mistake.* (general, we don’t know who)
- *Can you hear **something**?*
- *There was no mistaking the smell. Burning. There was a fire **somewhere**.*

We often use the plural pronoun *they* to refer back to (singular) *someone* or *somebody* when we do not know if the person is male or female:

- *Never judge **someone** by the way **they** look.* (or *Never judge **someone** by the way **he or she** looks*.)

### Someone and somebody

*Someone* and *somebody* have no difference in meaning. *Somebody* is a little less formal than *someone*. *Someone* is used more in writing than *somebody*. *Somebody* is more common in speaking:

- *We can no longer assume that because **someone** can do the job, they can teach the skill.*
- ***Somebody****’s got to say something to her. She can’t behave like that.*

### Something and anything

We can use both *something* and *anything* in negative questions. They have different meanings:

- *Didn’t she bring **something** to eat?* (I think she *did* bring something.)
- *Didn’t she bring **anything** to eat?* (I’m surprised she didn’t bring something.)
