# Any

*Any* is a determiner and a pronoun.

## Any as a determiner

We use *any* before nouns to refer to indefinite or unknown quantities or an unlimited entity:

- *Did you bring **any** bread?*
- *Mr Jacobson refused to answer **any** questions.*
- *If I were able to travel back to **any** place and time in history, I would go to ancient China.*

*Any* as a determiner has two forms: a strong form and a weak form. The forms have different meanings.

### Weak form any: indefinite quantities

We use *any* for indefinite quantities in questions and negative sentences. We use *some* in affirmative sentences:

- *Have you got **any** eggs?*
- *I haven’t got **any** eggs.*
- *I’ve got **some** eggs.*
- Not: *~~I’ve got any eggs.~~*

We use weak form *any* only with uncountable nouns or with plural nouns:

- \[talking about fuel for the car\]
- *Do I need to get* ***any petrol?*** (+ uncountable noun)
- *There aren’t **any** clean **knives**. They’re all in the dishwasher.* (+ plural noun)

:::warning

We don’t use *any* with this meaning with singular countable nouns:

- *Have you got **any** Italian cookery books?* (or … ***an*** *Italian cookery book?*)
- Not: *~~Have you got any Italian cookery book?~~*

:::

### Strong form any meaning ‘it does not matter which’

We use *any* to mean ‘it does not matter which or what’, to describe something which is not limited. We use this meaning of *any* with all types of nouns and usually in affirmative sentences.

In speaking we often stress *any*:

- *Call 0800675-437 for **any** information about the courses.* (+ uncountable noun)
- *When you make a late booking, you don’t know where you’re going to go, do you? It could be **any** destination.* (+ singular countable noun)
- \[talking about a contract for new employees\]
- *Do we have **any** form of agreement with new staff when they start?* (+ singular countable noun)
- \[a parent talking to a child about a picture he has painted\]
- A: *I don’t think I’ve ever seen you paint such a beautiful picture before. Gosh! Did you choose the colours?*
- B: *We could choose **any** colours we wanted*. (+ plural countable noun)

## Any as a pronoun

*Any* can be used as a pronoun (without a noun following) when the noun is understood.

- A: *Have you got some £1 coins on you?*
- B: *Sorry, I don’t think I have* ***any***. (understood: I don’t think I have any £1 coins.)
- \[parents talking about their children’s school homework\]
- A: *Do you find that Elizabeth gets lots of homework? Marie gets a lot*.
- B: *No not really. She gets hardly* ***any***. (understood: She gets hardly any homework.)
- A: *What did you think of the cake? It was delicious, wasn’t it?*
- B: *I don’t know. I didn’t get* ***any***. (understood: I didn’t get any of the cake.)

## Any of

We use *any* with *of* before articles (*a/an, the*), demonstratives (*this, these*), pronouns (*you, us*) or possessives (*his, their*):

- *Shall I keep **any of these** spices? I think they’re all out of date.*
- Not: … ~~any these spices?~~

We use *any of* to refer to a part of a whole:

- *Are **any of you** going to the meeting?*
- *I couldn’t answer **any of these** questions.*
- *I listen to Abba but I’ve never bought **any of their** music.*

## Not any and no

*Any* doesn’t have a negative meaning on its own. It must be used with a negative word to mean the same as *no*.

## Any or every?

We use *any* and *every* to talk about the total numbers of things in a group. Their meanings are not exactly the same:

- ***Any*** *doctor can prescribe medicine.* (or ***Every*** *doctor can …*)

*Every* always refers to the total number of something. *Any* refers to one, several or all of a total number. We use *every* not *any* with singular countable nouns when we mean ‘each individual member of a group of something’.

## Any and comparatives

We use *any* with comparative adjectives and adverbs:

- *You can’t buy this laptop **any cheaper** than here.* (It isn’t possible to buy the laptop cheaper in another place.)
- *I’ll see if we can go **any faster**.* (faster than we are going now)

## Any: typical errors

We don’t use ‘weak form’ *any* with singular countable nouns:

- *They have a big lunch in school so they don’t need **a** hot meal in the evening.*
- Not: … ~~so they don’t need any hot meal in the evening~~.

We use *every* not *any* with singular countable nouns when we mean ‘each individual member of a group’:

- *The hotel is luxurious and it has **every** type of activity.*
- Not: … ~~it has any type of activity~~ …

- *Every*

:::

We don’t use ‘weak form’ *any* on its own in statements. We use *no* or we put a negative word, e.g. *not*, before it:

- *There were **no** lifts so we had to climb five flights of stairs.*
- *There weren**’t any** lifts so we had to climb five flights of stairs.*
- Not: *~~There were any lifts~~* …

We use *some* not *any* before countable nouns in statements to refer to an indefinite quantity of something:

- *I must buy **some** plants. They’re so nice.*
- Not: *~~I must buy any plants.~~*
