# Least, the least, at least

We use the quantifier *least* to talk about quantities, amounts and degree. (*The*) *least* is the superlative form of *little*. We use *the least* with different classes of words. We use *the least* to make the superlative forms of longer adjectives and the majority of adverbs:

- *Rosalind seems to be **the least** worried about their move.* (+ adjective)
- ***The least*** *environmentally damaging power source is also the most expensive.*
- *The machines that worked (the) **least** efficiently were replaced.*

We use *the least* with a noun to mean ‘less than all of the others’. We can leave out the noun when it is obvious:

- *He did **the least** work of any of us.*
- *We had a quiz. Rory got the most points. Tim got* ***the least.*** (the least points)

We use *least* and *the least* with a verb as an adverb:

- *None of them worked much, but Karen worked **the least**.*
- *Think of the person you’d **least** expect to get the job.*

## At least

We use *at least* (and with more emphasis *at the very least*) to talk about a minimum number or amount, meaning ‘no less than’:

- *There were **at least** twenty people there.*
- *It’ll cost you £3,000 **at the very least**.*

We also use *at least* to express a minimum of what we expect to happen, usually when we are annoyed about something:

- *You could **at least** have phoned me to say you weren’t coming. I waited for ages.*

We use *at least* to rephrase something we have said, to make it more accurate:

- *She hasn’t got any children. **At least**, I don’t think she has.*

We also use *at least* to introduce something positive in a situation that seems negative:

- *It’s a shame it’s so cold but **at least** it isn’t raining.*
