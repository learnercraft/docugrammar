# Less

We use the quantifier *less* to talk about reduced quantities, amounts or degree. *Less* is a comparative word.

## Less: position

We use *less* with different classes of words. We use *less* after verbs but before every other word class:

- \[talking about a car\]
- *This model consumes **less fuel**.* (*less* + noun)
- \[sign on a bus\]
- *Give up this seat to someone **less able** to stand.* (*less* + adjective)
- *Second class post arrives **less quickly** than first class.* (*less* + adverb)
- *It **costs less** to go by bus than by train.* (verb + *less*)

- Determiners (*the, my*, *some*, *this*)
- *Little*, *a little*, *few*, *a few*

## Less with nouns

We use *less* on its own with singular uncountable nouns:

- *You’ve got **less chance** of passing if you don’t work hard.*
- *Small local shops can be more expensive and can have **less choice**.*

## Less of

Whenever we use *less* before articles (*a/an, the*), demonstratives (*this, that*), possessives (*my, your*) or pronouns (*him, it*), we need *of*:

- *Doctors and nutritionists always seem to be telling us to eat **less of the** food we enjoy.*
- *There was **less of a** crowd at the match today than at last week’s.*
- *We see **less of them** since they moved away.*

## Less without a noun (as a pronoun)

We usually leave out the noun after *less* when the noun is understood:

- *That’s too much pasta for me. Can I have **less**?* (less pasta)

## Less and less

We often use *less and less* to emphasise a decrease in something:

- *Ever since I met you, my work has seemed **less and less** important.*
- *I’ve been sleeping **less and less**.*
