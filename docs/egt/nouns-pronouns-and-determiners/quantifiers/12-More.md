# More

We use the quantifier *more* to talk about additional quantities, amounts and degree. *More* is a comparative word.

## More with nouns, adjectives, adverbs, verbs, prepositions

We use *more* with different classes of words. We use *more* after verbs but before every other word class:

- \[instructions on a computer screen\]
- *Click here for **more** answers.* (*more* + noun)
- *My father was **more** upset than I had ever seen him.* (*more* + adjective)
- *The interest rate has gone up again. We’re going to have to pay **more**.* (verb + *more*)
- \[talking about a car\]
- *It will start **more** easily, run **more** smoothly and deliver **more** power*. (*more*, + adverb, *more* + adverb, *more* + noun)
- *Who’s **more** in need of a good night’s sleep, you or me?* (*more* + prepositional phrase)

### More with nouns

We can use *more* with plural countable nouns and uncountable nouns:

- *There are **more** chairs in the room opposite if you need them.* (countable)
- *We need **more** information before we can make a decision.* (uncountable)

### More of

When we use *more* before articles (*a/an, the*), demonstratives (*this, that*), possessives (*my, your*) or pronouns (*him, it*), we need *of*:

- *Can I have **more of** that delicious cake you baked?*
- *How many **more of** my relatives have you not met, I wonder?*
- *I think we’re going to see a lot **more of** her.*

### More without a noun (as a pronoun)

We usually leave out the noun after *more* when the noun is obvious:

- *I’d like some coffee. Is there any **more**?* (more coffee)

### More and more

We often use *more and more* to emphasise an increase or decrease in something:

- ***More and more*** *people are using the Internet every day.*

### More or longer?

When we are talking about more time, we usually use *longer* rather than *more*:

- *Would you like to stay a bit **longer**?*
- Not: *~~Would you like to stay a bit more?~~*
