# Some

*Some* is a determiner and a pronoun.

## Some as a determiner

We use *some* before nouns to refer to indefinite quantities. Although the quantity is not important or not defined, using *some* implies a limited quantity:

- *Can you get me **some** milk?* (The quantity isn’t specified. *Some* suggests a normal amount, not an unlimited amount. Compare: *Can you get me five litres of milk?*)
- *I’ve got **some** questions for you.*
- *There are elephants in Africa and Asia.* (The number is not limited.)
- Not: *~~There are some elephants in Africa and Asia.~~*

*Some* as a determiner has two forms: a weak form and a strong form. The forms have different meanings.

### Weak form some /səm/

We use the weak form of *some* in affirmative sentences and in questions (usually expecting the answer ‘yes’), when the quantity is indefinite or not important (we use *any* in questions and negative sentences):

- *I’ve got* ***some*** /səm/ *water.*
- *Have you got **some** water?* (expecting the answer *yes*)
- *Have you got **any** water?* (open *yes-no* question)
- *I haven’t got **any** water.* (negative)

We use the weak form of *some* only with uncountable nouns and plural nouns:

- *I’m looking for **some** advice****.*** (+ uncountable noun)
- *Do you need **some** help?* (+ uncountable noun)
- *We need to make **some** changes to the programme.* (+ plural noun)
- *There are a lot of advantages in doing the course online, but there are **some** disadvantages* *too.* (+ plural noun)

:::warning

We don’t use weak form *some* with singular countable nouns:

- *If you’re looking for a book to read, I can recommend ‘Animal Farm’.*
- Not: *~~If you’re looking for some book to read~~* …

:::

### Strong form some /sʌm/

The strong form of *some* is stressed. This form contrasts with *others* or *all* or *enough*:

- *Why do **some** people live longer than other people?* (some, not others)
- ***Some*** *boys went to the front of the stage to get a better view. The rest of us couldn’t see a thing.* (some, not all)
- *There were **some** cakes left but not enough for everyone.* (some, but not enough)
- *I’m not keen on **some** types of fish. I find plaice a bit tasteless.*

We can use this strong form to refer to someone or something particular but unknown, especially with singular countable nouns:

- *There must be **some** way of opening this printer!*
- ***Some*** *idiot driver crashed into the back of me.*

### Some with numbers

We use the strong form of *some* with numbers. It can suggest an unexpectedly high amount:

- ***Some*** *£30 billion was needed to rebuild the hospital.*
- ***Some*** *60% of the course is devoted to design.*

### Leaving out some

We don’t use *some* when we are talking about things or people in general, when we have no idea of number or quantity:

- *Rats make good pets.* (rats in general)
- *There were **some** rats in the kitchen.* (a number of rats)
- *Does your car run on petrol or diesel?* (general)
- *I need **some** petrol.* (specific petrol for my car)

We don’t use *some* for large or unlimited quantities and amounts:

- *The earthquake victims urgently need tents, blankets and water.*
- Not: … ~~some tents, some blankets and some water.~~

## Some as a pronoun

We use *some* as a pronoun (i.e. without a noun following) when the noun is understood:

- *If you need any money, I’ll lend you **some**.*
- *French mustards are usually flavoured with spices. **Some** have added sugar. **Some** are quite salty.*

## Some of

:::warning

We use *some* with *of* before *the*, demonstratives (*this, that*), pronouns (*you, us*) or possessives (*my, your*). We use *some of* to refer to a part of a whole:

- *I wasn’t sure about **some of** the answers.*
- *It was great to meet **some of** her friends and colleagues.*
- Not: … ~~some her friends~~ …
- \[from a TV news programme\]
- *First a look at **some of** today’s main stories in some more detail.*

## Some: typical errors

We don’t use weak form *some* with singular countable nouns:

- *In the reception area we found a brochure about the history of the house.*
- Not: … ~~we found some brochure~~ …

We use *some*, not *a* or *an*, before uncountable nouns:

- *Do you need **some** overnight accommodation?*
- Not: … ~~an overnight accommodation?~~

We don’t use weak form *some* on its own in negative statements. We use *any*:

- A: *Did you get the eggs?*
- B: *No, there weren’t* ***any***.
- Not: *~~No, there weren’t some.~~*

We don’t use *some* to mean *a few* when we are referring to units of time:

- *I’m looking for someone to help me for **a few** days.*
- Not: … ~~to help me for some days.~~
