# How

The adverb *how* most commonly means ‘in what way’ or ‘to what extent’.

## How in questions

We use *how* when we introduce direct and indirect questions:

- *I haven’t seen you for ages. **How** are you?*
- ***How*** *was the film? Was it as bad as you thought?*
- *Do you know **how** I can get to the bus station?*
- *I asked her **how** she was but she didn’t answer me.*

We use *how* to introduce questions about measurements or amounts:

- ***How*** *old is your grandfather?*
- ***How*** *often do you get to your cottage at weekends?*
- ***How*** *much does the average DVD player cost these days?*
- \[the ‘Prado’ is a museum and art gallery in Madrid\]
- ***How*** *far is it to the Prado and **how** long will it take us to get there by taxi?*

## How in indirect questions

We often use *how* with verbs such as *tell*, *wonder* and *know* in indirect questions:

- *I just don’t know **how** she manages to cook so well in such a small kitchen.*
- *I wonder **how** they do that.*

## How in exclamations

In exclamations we use *how* before adjectives, adverbs and verb phrases. In verb phrases the word order is subject + verb:

- *They’ve bought her some flowers. **How** nice of them!*
- ***How*** *fantastic!*
- ***How*** *beautifully they sang!*
- ***How*** *we love New York!*

We don’t use *how* with a noun phrase. We use *what*:

- ***What*** *a gorgeous coat!*
- Not: *~~How a gorgeous coat!~~*

## How about …?

In informal speaking we commonly use *how about* + noun phrase and *how about* + *\-ing* form when we make suggestions:

## Typical errors

In exclamations involving clauses, the word order is subject + verb:

***How*** *I love real Italian ice-cream!*

Not: *~~How love I real Italian ice-cream!~~*

We don’t use *how* with a noun phrase, we use *what*:

- ***What*** *a nice idea!*
- Not: *~~How a nice idea!~~*
