# Whose

Whose is a *wh*\-word. We use *whose* to ask questions and to introduce relative clauses.

## Whose as a question word

We use *whose* to ask a question about possession:

- ***Whose*** *birthday is it today?*
- ***Whose*** *house was used in the film ‘Gosford Park’?*
- ***Whose*** *are these gloves?*

We use *whose* in indirect questions:

- *Juliet wondered **whose** the sports car was.*

:::warning

Don’t confuse *whose* and *who’s*. *Who’s* means *who is*:

- ***Whose*** *book is this?* (Who does this book belong to?)
- ***Who’s*** *driving us home?* (Who is driving us home?)

:::

## Whose in relative clauses

We use *whose* to introduce a relative clause indicating possession by people, animals and things:

- *John works with that other chap **whose** name I can’t remember.*
- *Shirley has a 17-year-old daughter **whose** ambition is to be a photographer.*
- *This is the book **whose** title I couldn’t remember.*

## Typical error

We don’t use *whose* when we mean *who’s* (*who is*)

- ***Who’s*** *there?*
- Not: *~~Whose there?~~*
- ***Whose*** *little brother is he?*
- Not: *~~Who’s little brother is he?~~*
