# Equipment

We use the uncountable noun *equipment* to mean ‘the set of things that you need for a particular purpose’, such as tools or clothing:

- *We’ve bought camping **equipment**, including new sleeping bags and a little refrigerator.*
- *All of Vincent’s camera **equipment** was stolen from his car.*

:::warning

Because *equipment* is uncountable, we cannot say ‘an equipment’ or ‘equipments’. To refer to a single item of equipment, we say *a piece of equipment*:

- *On board is **a piece of equipment** – a radiometer called the ATSR – which can measure the temperature of the seas.*
