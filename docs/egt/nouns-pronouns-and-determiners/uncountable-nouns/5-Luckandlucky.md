# Luck and lucky

We use the noun *luck* and the adjective *lucky* to talk about good things happening by chance, and not because of our own efforts:

- A: *Helen won first prize in an online competition, a two-week holiday in Italy*.
- B: *Oh, that’s nice! I never have any* ***luck***. *I never win anything*.
- *It was a **lucky** coincidence that the train was late, because I was also late getting to the station.*

:::warning

*Luck* and *lucky* do not mean the same as *happiness* and *happy*:

- *The most important thing in life is to find **happiness**.*
- Not: … ~~is to find luck.~~
- *My grandparents had a very **happy** marriage. They were together for 54 years.*
- Not: … ~~a very lucky marriage.~~

:::

*Luck* is an uncountable noun, so we do not use it with the indefinite article *a/an*. We use expressions such as *some, a bit of* or *a lot of* to express amounts of luck:

- *I’ve had **a lot of luck** with jobs over the years.*
- Not: *~~I’ve had a luck~~* …

When we talk about *luck* in general, we don’t use the definite article *the*:

- *A lot of good things in life happen through **luck** rather than through planning.*
- Not: … ~~through the luck~~ …

- When do we use articles?

:::

*Good luck!*, *(The) best of luck!* and *I wish you luck!* are common expressions we use to say that we hope good things will happen to someone. They are followed by *with*:

- A: *I’ve got my driving test tomorrow*.
- B: ***Good luck!***
- A: *Thanks*.
- ***Best of luck with your job interview!***
- Not: *~~Best luck.~~*
