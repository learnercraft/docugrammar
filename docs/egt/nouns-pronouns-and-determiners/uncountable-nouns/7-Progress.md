# Progress

*Progress* is an uncountable noun. We most commonly use it with the verb *make*:

- *She’s made a lot of **progress** in Maths this term. Her teacher’s very pleased.*
- Not: *~~She’s made a lot of progresses~~* …
- ***Progress*** *is slow with the building of the new head office because the company is short of money.*

:::warning

When we refer to the ways in which society in general goes forward and improves itself, we use *progress* without *the*:

- ***Progress*** *will only happen when people begin to understand that every individual has a responsibility to play their part.*
- Not: *~~The progress will only~~* …
