# Thing and stuff

## Thing

We use the general noun *thing* more commonly in speaking than in writing. It is most commonly used to refer to physical objects, but we also use *thing* to refer to ideas, actions and events:

- *What’s that **thing** over there in the car park?*
- *She always says that she hasn’t a **thing** to wear.*
- *Can you put your **things** in the upstairs room?* (*things* here = personal belongings)
- *Anger is a very dangerous **thing** in a young man.*
- *So don’t rush him. These **things** take time and we certainly don’t want to upset him.*
- *A holiday? That’s just the **thing** for you.*
- A: *Hi Geoff. How’s **things**?* (*How’s things* is a common informal greeting.)
- B: *Fine, thanks. How are you?*

We often use *thing* in a similar way to *wh*\-cleft constructions (*What we need to do is* …). It is also often used with *to* and with *that*\-clauses (underlined):

- The thing we need to know is *why they missed the train.*
- The thing they said that we shouldn’t forget was *to take a boat trip on the lake.*
- The best thing to do is *to phone the doctor at once.*
- The thing that worries me most is *the cost of the holiday.*

In speaking, we commonly use the phrase *the thing is*. We use it when we want to focus on something, or to indicate that there is a problem:

- ***The thing is*** *… erm … we don’t have time to visit New York as well as Washington.*
- *Yeah, that’s OK, but **the thing is**, he still hasn’t apologised for being late.*

*Thing* is an example of vague language. It allows speakers not to sound too direct. We often use *thing* in phrases such as *things like that*, *that kind of thing*:

- *They’re cooking lots of different Italian and Spanish dishes and **things like*** ***that**.*
- *When I worked in a newspaper office, there wasn’t time for eating lunch or **that kind of thing**, you know.*

We also use *thing* to show both positive (usually affectionate) and negative attitudes, mainly when accompanied by appropriate adjectives:

- *Our cat is too old now to leave the house, poor **thing**.*
- *You lucky **thing**! I wish I had the chance to visit New Zealand.*
- A: *You’re going to get paint on that dress. Why don’t you get changed?*
- B: *It doesn’t matter. It’s just an old* ***thing***.

## Stuff

*Stuff* is one of the most common nouns in speaking. It is more informal than *thing*. It is not at all common in writing. *Stuff* is an uncountable noun. We use *stuff* in similar ways to *thing*, especially in vague language phrases such as *stuff like that*:

- *Where can we put our **stuff**?* (our belongings) (very similar to, but more informal than, *Where can we put our things?*)
- *She didn’t have much advice to offer. She just told us to learn lots of new English vocabulary and **stuff like that**.*
