# Weather

*Weather* is an uncountable noun:

- *We had nice **weather** on Monday for our trip to the coast.*
- Not: *~~We had a nice weather on Monday.~~*
- *The **weather** is always hot around the time of my birthday.*

If we want to talk about an individual period of weather, we can use *spell*:

- *We had a beautiful **spell of weather** for about a week, and then it rained for two weeks non-stop!*
