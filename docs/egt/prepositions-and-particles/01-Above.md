# Above

*Above* is a preposition (prep) or an adverb (adv).

## Above meaning ‘higher than’

*Above* means ‘higher than’. We usually use it when there is no contact between people or things:

- \[a doctor asks a patient\]
- *Can you raise your hand \[PREP\] **above** your head for me please?* (Can you raise your hand higher than your head?)
- *The river flowed gently through the valley, while birds flew \[ADV\] **above**. It was a beautiful scene.*

The opposites of *above* are *under*, *below* and *beneath*.

:::note[See also]

- *Over*
- *Beneath*
- *Above* or *over*?

## Measuring higher

We use *above* to talk about measurements and temperatures that are higher than a particular level:

- *Mexico City is 2,240 metres **above** sea level.*
- *Temperatures* ***above 25 degrees are rare in this part of the world.***

## As mentioned above: Referring back in writing

In formal writing, we often use *above* not *before* to refer back to something we have already written about. We can use *as mentioned above, as noted above, as demonstrated above, as shown above*:

- ***As noted above****, all employees must take part in our health and safety course.*
- Not: *~~As noted before~~* …
- ***As demonstrated above****, this problem is very complex.*
- Not: *~~As demonstrated before~~* …

We can also say *the above*. We only do this when the readers understand clearly what *the above* refers to:

- *As **the table above** shows, there has been a rapid rise in greenhouse gases.* (or *As **the above** shows …* the reader understands that *the above* refers to the table)
