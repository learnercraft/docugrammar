# Among and amongst

*Among* and *amongst* are prepositions.

*Among* means ‘in the middle or included in a larger group of people or things’. *Among* is commonly followed by a plural noun phrase:

- *I’m not worried about her. She’s living **among** friends.*
- *I think I’ve got that album **among** my boxes of CDs upstairs.*

*Amongst* is sometimes used as an alternative to *among*. It is more formal and less common:

- *The results show that both girls are **amongst** the top 10% of students in the whole school.*
