# At, in and to (movement)

We use *to* when we are talking about movement in the direction of a point, place, or position:

- *Let’s all go **to** the cinema tonight!*
- *When you come* ***to my place, you’ll see our new pet rabbit.***
- \[giving directions\]
- *If you drive **to** the end of the road, then turn left and park in the first car park on the right …*

We often use the combination *from … to …* when we are talking about moving from one point to another:

- *Is it far **from** your house **to** the nearest shop?*
- *How long will it take to get **from** the hospital **to** the train station?*

:::warning

*Go in* is a commonly used phrasal verb meaning ‘enter’. We don’t use it to talk about travelling to or moving in the direction of a place:

- *Why don’t you **go in**?* (phrasal verb meaning ‘enter’)
- *When did you **go to** Barcelona?* (preposition *to*)
- Not: *~~When did you go in Barcelona?~~*

:::

We say that we *arrive at* a place, when we see it as point, but we arrive *in* a larger area (e.g. a city or a country). We don’t use *to* with *arrive*:

- *I **arrived at** the station just in time.* (arrive *at* a place)
- Not: *~~I arrived to the station~~* …

- *It was 4 pm when we **arrived in** Italy.* (arrive *in* a country)
- Not: … ~~when we arrived to Italy.~~
