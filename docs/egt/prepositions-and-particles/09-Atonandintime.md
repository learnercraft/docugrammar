# At, on and in (time)

We use *at*:

- with particular points on the clock:

*I’ll see you **at five o’clock**.*

- with particular points in the day:

*The helicopter took off **at midday** and headed for the island.*

- with particular points in the week:

*What are you doing **at the weekend**?*

- with special celebrations:

***At the New Year****, millions of people travel home to be with their families* (but we say ***on*** your birthday).

We don’t use at with the question What time …? in informal situations:

*What time are you leaving?* (preferred to *At what time are you leaving?*)

We use *on*:

- with dates:

*We moved into this house **on 25 October 1987**.*

- with a singular day of the week to refer to one occasion:

*I’ve got to go to London **on Friday**.*

- with a plural day of the week to refer to repeated events:

*The office is closed **on Fridays**.* (every Friday) In informal situations, we often leave out *on* before plural days:

*Do you work **Saturdays**?*

- with special dates:

*What do you normally do **on your birthday**?*

We use *in*:

- with parts of the day:

*I’ll come and see you **in the morning** for a cup of coffee, okay?*

- with months:

*We usually go camping **in July or August**.*

- with years:

*The house was built **in 1835**.*

- with seasons:

*The garden is wonderful **in the spring** when all the flowers come out.*

- with long periods of time:

*The population of Europe doubled **in the nineteenth century**.*

## At or on?

We use *at* to talk about public holidays and weekends, but when we talk about a particular special day or weekend, we use *on*.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>We never go away </i><b><i>at the New Year</i></b><i> because the traffic is awful.</i></td><td><b><i>On New Year’s Day</i></b><i>, the whole family gets together.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I’ll go and see my mother </i><b><i>at the weekend</i></b><i> if the weather’s okay.</i></td><td><i>The folk festival is always held </i><b><i>on the last weekend in July</i></b><i>.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

\*Note that American English speakers usually say *on the weekend*.

## In or on?

We use *in* with *morning, afternoon, evening* and *night*, but we use *on* when we talk about a specific morning, afternoon, etc., or when we describe the part of the day.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>I always work best </i><b><i>in the morning</i></b><i>. I often get tired </i><b><i>in the afternoon</i></b><i>.</i></td><td><i>The ship left the harbour </i><b><i>on the morning of the ninth of November</i></b><i>.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>In the evening</i></b><i> they used to sit outside and watch the sun going down.</i></td><td><i>It happened </i><b><i>on a beautiful summer’s evening</i></b><i>.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

## At or in?

*In the night* usually refers to one particular night; *at night* refers to any night in general:

- *I was awake **in the night**, thinking about all the things that have happened.*
- *‘It’s not safe to travel **at night**,’ the officer said.*

## At the end or in the end?

We use *at the end* (often with *of*) to talk about the point in time where something finishes. We use *in the end* to talk about things that happen after a long time or after a series of other events:

- ***At the end*** *of the film, everyone was crying.*
- Not: *~~In the end of the film~~* …
- *I looked everywhere for the book but couldn’t find it, so **in the end** I bought a new copy.*

## At the beginning or in the beginning?

We use *at the beginning* (often with *of*) to talk about the point where something starts. We usually use *in the beginning* when we contrast two situations in time:

- ***At the beginning*** *of every lesson, the teacher told the children a little story.*
- ***In the beginning****, nobody understood what was happening, but after she explained everything very carefully, things were much clearer.*

## Other uses of in with time

We use *in* to say how long it takes someone to do something:

- *He was such a clever musician. He could learn a song **in about five minutes**.*

We use an apostrophe *\-s* construction (*in a year’s time, in two months’ time*) to say when something will happen. We don’t use it to say how long someone takes to do something:

- *I won’t say goodbye because we’ll be seeing each other again **in three days’ time**. We can also say in three days, without time, in this example.*
- *He ran the marathon **in six hours and 20 minutes**.*
- Not: *~~He ran the marathon in six hours and 20 minutes’ time.~~*

## Time expressions without at, on, in

We don’t normally use *at, on* or *in* before time expressions beginning with *each*, *every*, *next, last, some, this, that, one, any, all*:

- *He plays football **every Saturday**.*
- *Are you free **next Monday** at two o’clock?*
- ***Last summer*** *we rented a villa in Portugal.*

## At, on and in (time): typical errors

We use *on* not *at* to talk about a particular day:

- *The two couples were married in two different cities **on the same day**, 25 years ago.*
- Not: … ~~at the same day, 25 years ago.~~

We don’t use *at* to refer to dates:

- *The General was killed **on 26 August**.*
- Not: … ~~at 26 August.~~

We use *at*, not *in*, with *weekend(s*):

- *What do you usually do **at the weekend**? Do you go away?*
- Not: *~~What do you usually do in the weekend?~~*

We use *in* with months, not *on*:

- *They’re going to Australia **in September** for a conference.*
- Not: *~~They’re going to Australia on September~~* …
