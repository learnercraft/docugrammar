# During

We use *during* before nouns and noun phrases to refer to when something happens over a period of time. *During* can refer to the whole time of the event:

- *You are not allowed to use your mobile phone **during** class.* (the whole of the class)
- *I have to have my window open **during** the night.* (the whole of the night)

In this meaning, *during* can often mean the same as *in*:

- *His grandfather fought in the army **during** the First World War.* (or … ***in*** *the First World War*.)
- *When I was a kid, our cousins often came to stay with us **during** the summer.* (or … ***in*** *the summer*.)

*During* can refer to something that happened while the main event was taking place. In such contexts, *during* means ‘at some unspecified point in time’ and is more common than *in*:

- *What was that noise I heard **during** the night, I wonder? or … **in** the night.* (I heard a noise at an unspecified point in the night.)
- *One day, **during** the Second World War, her father just disappeared.* (He disappeared at an unspecified point.)

:::warning

We don’t use *during* when we refer to numbers and lengths of time. In this case, we use *for*:

- *They lived in Edinburgh **for** four years.*
- Not: *~~They lived in Edinburgh during four years.~~*

:::

However, we can use *during* with *the first* or *the* *last* + length of time or time expression:

- ***During the first three years*** *of the war, 50,000 civilians were killed.* (*during* refers to when this happened.)
- *I haven’t done any exercise **during the last week**.* (*during* refers to when I didn’t do exercise.)

:::note[See also]

- *For*
- *During* or *for*?

## Typical error

We use *during* before nouns and noun phrases but not before verbs:

- ***While*** *I was waiting for the bus, I phoned some friends.*
- Not: *~~During I was waiting for the bus~~*…
