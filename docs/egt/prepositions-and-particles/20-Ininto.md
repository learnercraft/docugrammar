# In, into

*In* and *into* are prepositions.

## In, into: position and direction

We use *in* to talk about where something is in relation to a larger area around it:

- A: *Where’s Jane?*
- B: *She’s **in** the garden*.
- *I’ve left my keys **in** the car.*

We use *into* to talk about the movement of something, usually with a verb that expresses movement (e.g. *go*, *come*). It shows where something is or was going:

- A: *Where’s Jane?*
- B: *She’s gone **into** the house*.
- *Helen came **into** the room.*

With some verbs (e.g. *put*, *fall*, *jump*, *dive*) we can use either *in* or *into* with no difference in meaning:

- *Can you put the milk **in/into** the fridge?*
- *Her keys fell **in/into** the canal.*

We use *be into* to express enthusiasm or strong interest for something:

## Change into, turn into

We use *into* after verbs describing change:

- *We’ve **translated** the course **into** six different languages.*
- *She **changed into** her swimming costume and went for a swim.*
- *They **divided** the cake **into** four pieces.*
- Not: *~~They divided the cake in four pieces.~~*

We use *in* to make a number of phrasal verbs:

- *I was feeling very tired and I couldn’t really **take in** what she was saying.* (understand)
- *Please **call in** and see us next time you’re in the area.* (visit us briefly)
