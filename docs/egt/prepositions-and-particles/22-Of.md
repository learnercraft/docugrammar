# Of

*Of* is a preposition.

*Of* commonly introduces prepositional phrases which are complements of nouns, creating the pattern: noun + *of* + noun. This pattern is very common, especially to indicate different parts, pieces, amounts and groups:

- *Lima is the capital **of** Peru.*
- *Twenty-four-hour TV news makes sure we all know the main events **of** the day.*
- *Would you like some more pieces **of** toast?*

We also commonly use *of* as a preposition after different adjectives (*afraid of*, *generous of, proud of*) and verbs (*approve of*, *dream of, think of*):

- *I never thought she could take a flight on her own at her age. I feel very proud **of** her.*
- *Best of luck with the interview tomorrow. We’ll be thinking **of** you.*

We use the structure determiner + *of* + noun in expressions of quantity:

- *Most **of** the new workers in the country are from Turkey.*
- *Some **of** my best friends are computer scientists.*

*Of* is optional with *all, both*, *half* except before the object pronouns *me, you, it, him, her, us, them*:

- *Both (**of**) the finance ministers have decided to resign.*
- *All **of** them will be able to travel on the bus.*
- Not: *~~All them will be able to~~* …
