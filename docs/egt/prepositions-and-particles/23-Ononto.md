# On, onto

*On* and *onto* are prepositions.

We use *on* when we refer to a position on a surface (*on the table, on the ocean, on the moon, on the roof, on the bus*):

- *Your keys are **on** the table.*
- *The men were standing **on** the roof.*

We use *onto* to talk about direction or movement to a position on a surface, usually with a verb that expresses movement:

- *The cat climbed **onto** the roof.*
- *She emptied the suitcase full of clothes **onto** the floor.*

We use *on* to describe a position along a road or river or by the sea or by a lake:

- *The hotel is **on** the road opposite the beach.*
- *They have a fabulous house **on** a lake in Ireland.*

We use *onto* to describe movement towards an end position along a road or river:

- *The path leads **onto** the main road.*

We use *on* or *onto* with very little difference in meaning to refer to attachment or movement of something to something else. *Onto* gives a stronger feeling of movement:

- *Thereâ€™s a battery pack with the camera that you can clip **onto** a belt.*
- *You can save the data **onto** your hard disk.*
- *Have you put the pictures **on** your memory stick?*
