## Over: typical errors

*Over*, when used with periods of time, refers to the period from start to finish, not to any one moment during that time:

- *I arrived during the afternoon.*
- Not: *~~I arrived over the afternoon.~~*

*Over* as a prefix meaning ‘too much’ is connected to the word that comes after it, sometimes with a hyphen; we don’t write two separate words:

- *The nightclub was **overcrowded**.*
- Not: *~~The nightclub was over crowded.~~*
