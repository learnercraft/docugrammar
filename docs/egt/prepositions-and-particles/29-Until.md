# Until

*Until* is a preposition and a conjunction. *Until* is often shortened to *till* or *’til. Till* and *’til* are more informal and we don’t usually use them in formal writing.

## Until as a preposition

*Until* as a preposition means ‘up to (the time that)’:

- *We played chess **until** midnight.* (up to midnight)
- *The film didn’t end **till** eleven o’clock.*

We use *from* with *until* or *till* to talk about when something begins and when it ends:

- *I worked out at the gym **from** 6 pm **till** 7.30 pm.*
- *The road outside our house will be closed **from** 6 am **until** 6 pm tomorrow.*

We use *by*, not *until*, to talk about something that will happen before a particular time or deadline:

- *The movie will be finished **by** 9 pm.*
- Not: *~~The movie will be finished until/till 9 pm~~*.

We don’t use *until* or *till* to talk about quantity or numbers. We use *up to*:

- *The taxi can take **up to** five people.*
- Not: *~~The taxi can take until five people.~~*

We don’t use *until* or *till* to talk about distance. We use *as far as*:

- *Larry drove me **as far as** the shop and I walked the rest of the way home.*
- Not: *~~Larry drove me until the shop~~* …

## Until as a conjunction

We use *until* as a subordinating conjunction to connect an action or an event to a point in time:

- *Let’s wait here **till** the rain stops.* (*till* + subordinate clause)

:::warning

We don’t normally put the *until*\-clause before the main clause:

- *No one left the room **until** the talk ended.*
- Not: *~~Until the talk ended no one left~~* …

:::

We use present verb forms to refer to the future after *until*:

- *I can’t wait **until** the summer holidays **begin**.*
- Not: … ~~until the summer holidays will begin.~~

We also use the present perfect after *until* to refer to actions or events that will continue up to a point in the future:

- *We’ll sit here **till** Donna **has finished**.*
- Not: … ~~until Donna will have finished.~~

We use the past simple and past perfect to talk about events in the past:

- *He was the headteacher **until** he **retired** in 1968.*
- *We couldn’t put down the new floor **till** the plumber **had finished**.*

:::warning

We can’t use *until* or *till* to mean ‘in advance of’. In this case we use *before*:

- *Please return your registration form **before** you leave the room.*
- Not: *~~Please return your registration form until you leave the room.~~*

## Until: typical errors

We don’t use *until* to talk about things that will happen before a particular time or deadline; we use *by*:

- *All applications must be received **by** Friday, 26 June 2009.*
- Not: … ~~until Friday, 26 June 2009.~~

We don’t use *until* or *till* to talk about quantity; we use *up to*:

- *The theatre can hold **up to** two hundred people.*
- Not: *~~The theatre can hold until two hundred people.~~*

We don’t use *until* or *till* to talk about distance; we use *as far as*:

- *We had to drive **as far as** Liverpool for the last hockey match that I played.*
- Not: *~~We had to drive until Liverpool~~* …

Take care to spell *until* with only one *l* at the end: not ‘untill’.
