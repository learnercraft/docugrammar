# Within

*Within* is a preposition.

## Within: space

*Within* means ‘inside or not further than a particular area or space’:

- *People who live **within** the city pay higher local taxes than people who live just outside the city.* (= the people who live no further than the city boundary or limits)
- *We’ve always lived **within** ten miles of the coast. We love the sea.* (We’ve always lived no further than ten miles from the coast.)

## Within: time

We can use *within* to refer to time:

- *I’ve booked train tickets on the Internet. They should arrive **within** three days.* (no later than three days from now)
- *I’ve noticed her change **within** a very short time.*

:::warning

*Within* does not mean the same as *in*. *Within* stresses that something is not further than a particular area or space or not later than a particular time:

- *Your shirt is* ***in the drawer.***
- Not: *~~Your shirt is within the drawer.~~*
- *I always have tea **in** the afternoon.*
- Not: *~~I always have tea within the afternoon.~~*
