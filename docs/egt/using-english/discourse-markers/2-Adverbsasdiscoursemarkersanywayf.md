# Adverbs as discourse markers (anyway, finally)

Discourse markers organise longer pieces of conversation or text. They can mark the openings or closings of conversations, changes in topics, and other functions connected with organising a conversation or text. Most discourse markers belong to the class of adverbs.

- ***Anyway****, Iâ€™ve got to go and pick up the children.* (signals that the conversation is finishing)
- ***Finally****, we need to consider the broader economic issues.* (signals the last item in a list of points or arguments)
- ***Right****, now, sorry to keep you waiting.* (signals something new)
- ***So*** *you want to go to Spain, do you?* (focuses on a topic)
