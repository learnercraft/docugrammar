# In fact

*In fact* is a discourse marker.

We use *in fact* to add more detailed information to what has just been said:

- A: *Did she pass her driving test?*
- B: *Yes, she did;* ***in fact***, *she’s now taking an advanced driving test*.

*In fact* is commonly used in front position in a clause, although in informal situations, it may occur in end position:

- *The holiday was really disappointing – a complete disaster, **in fact**. It just rained all the time.*

Other discourse markers which have similar meanings include:

- *in actual fact, as a matter of fact, in point of fact, actually, in truth*.
