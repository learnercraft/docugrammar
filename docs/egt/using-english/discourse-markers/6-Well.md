# Well

*Well* is a discourse marker, adverb or adjective.

## Well as a discourse marker

Spoken English:

In speaking, we often use *well* at the start of what we say. Its main function is to show that we are thinking about the question that we have been asked:

- A: *How was your meeting?*
- B: ***Well***, *it’s difficult to say. I think they liked our presentation but I am not sure*.
- A: *How long would it take to drive from Dundee to here?*
- B: ***Well***, *let me see. I’d say it would take at least three hours, if not more*.

Spoken English:

We can use *well* to show a slight change in topic, or when what we are about to say is not quite what is expected:

- A: *Have you found a house yet?*
- B: ***Well***, *we’ve stopped looking actually. Nadia’s company has offered her another contract and we’ve decided to stay in Edinburgh for another year*.
- A: *Did you like that book?*
- B: ***Well***, *it was interesting, but war stories are not really my favourite*.

We can use *well* when we want to change what we have said slightly, or say something in another way:

- *I’m not going on a hiking holiday. I hate walking. **Well**, I hate being out in the cold weather.*
- *Fiona is feeling better. **Well**, she’s much better than she was. She’ll be back to work on Monday.*

We can use *well* when we admit or acknowledge that something is correct or true:

- A: *It’ll take four hours to get to Glasgow*.
- B: *It’ll take more than that. We’ll have to stop for a break somewhere*.
- A: ***Well***, *that’s true*.

:::warning

We can use *well* with a rising intonation as a type of question when we want someone to tell us something. In this case, it means *tell me* or *tell us*. Be careful when you use this, as it can sound very direct:

- A: *There’s something I have to tell you*.
- B: *What is it?*
- A: \[silence\]
- B: ***Well?***
- ***Well?*** *What did you say to her?*

## Well as an adverb

We use *well* as an adverb when something is done to a good standard or in a good way:

- *He drives very **well**.*
- *I work very **well** late at night.*

We often use *well* before *\-ed* forms, often with a hyphen:

- *This table isn’t very **well-made**.*
- *I like my steak **well-cooked**.* (I like my steak cooked for a long time.)
- A: *I’ve passed my driving test!*
- B: ***Well done***.

### Well and good

*Well* and *good* have a similar meaning, but *good* is not used as an adverb. It is used as an adjective.

## Well as an adjective

We use *well* as an adjective, normally after a linking verb such as *be, look* or *get*, to mean ‘in good health’:

- A: *How are you?*
- B: *I’m very* ***well***, *thanks. And you?*
- *Are you feeling OK? You don’t look very **well**.*

In American English, it is common to use *good* instead of *well* in this context. This is less common in British English:

- A: *And how’s your mother?*
- B: *She’s* ***good***. *Thanks for asking*.
