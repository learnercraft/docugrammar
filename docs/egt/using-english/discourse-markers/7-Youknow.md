# You know

We use *you know* very commonly in speaking. It is used to check with our listeners that we share the same knowledge. When we use *you know*, we assume that the listener or listeners do have the knowledge that we want them to have:

- *Well, what can I say, **you know**, I want my career to go far.*
- A: *How was the match?*
- B: *Well, they played OK but the defence was*, ***you know***, *the same as always*.

*You know* is also sometimes used to allow us time to think when we are speaking:

- A: *Did you like the play?*
- B: *Well, Iâ€™m not sure, it was*, ***you know***, *it was interesting*.
