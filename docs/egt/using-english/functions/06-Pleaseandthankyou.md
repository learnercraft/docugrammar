# Please and thank you

*Please* and *thank you* are usually associated with politeness. We use them a lot in English.

## Please

We use *please* to make a request more polite:

- *Can I borrow your pen, **please**?*
- ***Please*** *call our Reservations Department for more information.*

### Word order

We usually put *please* at the end of a request with *could*, *can* and *would*, but we can also put it at the beginning or in the middle. *Please* in the mid position makes the request stronger.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>Could you say that again, </i><b><i>please</i></b><i>?</i><i>Would you say that again, </i><b><i>please</i></b><i>?</i></td><td><b><i>Please</i></b><i> could you do that again?</i><b><i>Please</i></b><i> would you say that again?</i></td><td><i>Could you </i><b><i>please</i></b><i> say that again?</i><i>Can we </i><b><i>please</i></b><i> change the subject?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>This is the most common position for <i>please</i> in a request.</td><td><i>Please</i> in front position can make the request sound stronger, like an order.</td><td><i>Please</i> in mid position makes the request stronger. In this position <i>please</i> is often stressed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

When talking to adults, children often use *please* in front position to adults when making a request or asking for permission.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>[child to teacher]<b><i>Please</i></b><i> can I leave early today, Sir?</i></td><td>[employee to boss]<i>Can I leave early today, </i><b><i>please</i></b><i>?</i>Not: Please can I leave early today?</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Please with imperatives

We use *please* with the imperative form of a verb to express a polite request or order. We often find this in a classroom situation or in polite notices or written requests using the imperative. We usually put *please* in front position, at the beginning of the request, particularly in written requests and notices:

- \[in a classroom\]
- ***Please*** *turn to page 10.* (or *Turn to page 10*, ***please***.)
- ***Please*** *note that credit cards are not accepted.*
- ***Please*** *send your application, including details of your skills, qualifications and work achievements, to …*

In speaking, we often use *please* to make an order less direct:

- *Pass the salt, **please**.*

We often use *please* to accept something politely, particularly with food and drink:

- A: *What would you like to drink?*
- B: *Orange juice*, ***please***.
- A: *I’m making a cup of tea. Would you like one?*
- B: *Ooh, yes*, ***please***.

- A: *Do you want a lift to the station?*
- B: *Yes*, ***please***. *That would be great*.

We use *please* to encourage or, more strongly, to beg someone to do something:

- A: *I’ll give you a call if I hear anything more*.
- B: ***Please*** *do*.
- ***Please*** *believe me.*
- *But, **please**, don’t worry about it.*

We can use *please* on its own to express disbelief, surprise or annoyance:

- A: *They took a taxi 100 metres down the road*.
- B: *Oh*, ***please***. *I can’t believe that*.
- ***Please****. Just stop doing that. It’s really irritating.*

### Please as a verb

We use *please* as a verb:

- *You can come and go as you **please**.* (as you like)
- *She was very hard to* ***please.*** (to make happy)

## Thank you and thanks

We use expressions with *thank you* and *thanks* to respond to something politely and to show we are grateful for something. *Thanks* is more informal than *thank you*. We often add other words to make the response stronger:

- *Thanks.*
- *Thank you.*
- *Thank you very much (indeed).*
- *Thanks very much (indeed).*
- *Thanks a lot.*
- Not: *~~Thank you a lot.~~*

We use *thank you* and *thanks* to answer a polite question or to reply to a comment:

- A: *How are you today?*
- B: *I’m fine*, ***thank you***.
- A: *Your hair looks good*.
- B: ***Thanks very much***.

We use *thank you* and *thanks* to accept or receive something and *no, thank you* or *no, thanks* to refuse something.

:::warning

*Thank you* on its own as a reply to an offer means that we accept:

- A: *Would you like some more soup?*
- B: ***Thank you***. (This means *yes*.)

:::

We use *thank you* and *thanks* to say that we are grateful for something:

- ***Thank you*** *for the flowers.*
- \[the phone is ringing; A offers to answer it\]
- A: *I’ll get the phone*.
- B: ***Thanks***.
- \[from a radio phone-in programme\]
- *Frank, **thank you** very much indeed for joining us on the programme this morning.*

We use *thank you* even when we are receiving something that is ours:

- \[in a shop, at the checkout\]
- A: *Here’s your change*.
- B: ***Thank you***.

In informal speaking, we can use *cheers* or (very informally) *ta* to say *thanks*:

- A: *There’s a coffee for you in the kitchen*.
- B: ***Cheers***. (or ***Ta*** *very much!*) (very informal)

### Thank you for \+ -ing form

*Thank you* *for* or *thanks for* can be followed by the *\-ing* form:

- ***Thank you for*** *helping us.*
- ***Thanks for*** *sending a card.*

### Thank you as a noun

We can use *thank you* as a noun, often with *big*:

- *A big **thank you** to all those who helped with the sale.*

### Thank as a verb

We can use *thank* as a verb, always with an object and often with *for* + noun and *for* + -*ing*:

- *I **thank** you for your advice.* (quite formal)
- *We would like to **thank** everyone for their generosity.*
- *I’d like to **thank** you for coming here tonight.*

### Thank God

We say *thank God*, not *thanks God*, when we are pleased that something has happened which we feared would not happen, or vice versa:

- ***Thank God*** *you’re home! I was so worried that you’d had an accident.*
- Not: *~~Thanks God you’re home.~~*

### Replying to thanks

We reply to *thanks* with expressions such as *you’re welcome* (more formal), *not at all, no problem*. We don’t use *please* as an answer to *thank you*:

- A: ***Thanks*** *for the flowers. You shouldn’t have*.
- B: ***You’re welcome***.
- Not: *~~Please~~. or ~~Nothing~~*.
- A: ***Thank you*** *for fixing the internet connection*.
- B: ***No problem***.

### Thanks to

We often use *thanks to* to mean ‘because of’. It is more common in writing than speaking:

- \[from a newspaper report; Ipswich is a town in England\]
- *An Ipswich man is back home from hospital and planning his summer wedding, **thanks to** a life-saving heart transplant.*
- ***Thanks to*** *cancer research, John is now fit and well.*
