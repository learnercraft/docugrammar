# Warnings

A warning is something that makes us aware of possible danger. There are a number of ways of warning someone. Warnings can be weak or strong.

## Weak warnings

Weak warnings are similar to advice. We can use a number of phrases:

- ***I wouldn’t*** *swim there **if I were you**.*
- ***I don’t think you should*** *drink the water here.*
- ***I don’t think you ought to*** *say no to the job offer.* (more formal)
- ***A word of warning****, there are snakes on the trails.* (Be careful)

## Strong warnings

We usually use *don’t* in strong warnings:

- ***Don’t*** *cross the road when the pedestrian light is red.*
- ***Don’t*** *try to open the door when the train is moving.*
- *Whatever you do, **don’t** take a lift from an unofficial taxi driver.*

Sometimes we say *I warn you* or *I must warn you*:

- *It’s a wonderful restaurant but, **I warn you**, it isn’t cheap.*
- ***I must warn you*** *it gets very cold at night in the mountains. Make sure to bring some warm clothes.*

## Public warning notices

We often use *beware of*, *caution, warning* and *danger* in public warning notices:

- ***Beware*** ***of*** *the dog.*
- ***Caution****: Wet floor.*
- ***Warning****: this building site is private property.*
- \[near a river where it is dangerous to swim\]
- ***Danger****: Strong currents.*

## Warning of immediate danger

Spoken English:

When we want to say something to warn someone about an immediate danger, we can use phrases like *careful, be careful, watch out, look out, mind*:

- ***Be careful!*** *That chair is broken!*
- ***Watch out!*** *You’re about to hit the car behind you.*
- ***Look out!*** *There’s a rock falling.*
- ***Mind*** *your step!* (pay attention to the step)
