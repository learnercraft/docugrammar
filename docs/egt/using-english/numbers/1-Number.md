# Number

When we use the word *number*, we refer to specific numbers:

- *Here’s the phone **number** of the firm where she works.*
- *She plays in the local hockey team and wears the **number** six.*

We also use the phrases *a number of*, *numbers of* or *the number of* with a plural verb when we mean ‘many’ or ‘several’:

- *There are **a number of** things we need to discuss.*
- ***A*** *significant **number of** people are ill with flu so the performance had to be cancelled.*
- *Large **numbers of** bees have died because of the cold summer.*
- *I couldn’t believe **the number of** cars that were parked outside the hall.*

## Numbers: first, second, third

Numbers such as *first, second*, *third* are ordinal numbers. We use them to put things in an order. We most commonly use ordinal numbers as determiners. When we use ordinal numbers as determiners (before nouns), we commonly use other determiners such as articles (*a/an*, *the*) and possessives (*my*, *your*) in front of them:

- *This was the **fifth** science exam that he had failed.*
- *It’s her **twenty-first** birthday and she’s spending it with friends in Malaysia.*

We use the ordinal numbers to refer to dates. We usually write them in abbreviated form and often in superscript (above the line). We usually say *the* and *of* when we speak, but we often omit them in writing:

- *My birthday is **3rd** January.* (usually spoken as ‘the third of January’)
- *The museum was opened on **25th** June 2008.*
- *What are you doing on the **2nd** of May? Do you want to join us at the theatre?*

We also use ordinal numbers as nouns:

- *All three singers in the competition were excellent but I’m voting for the **third**.*

Ordinal numbers are also used as adverbs:

- A: *He came **tenth** in the New York marathon*.
- B: *That’s fantastic! Did he really?*
- ***First****, let me introduce you to my brother Jack.*

## Numbers: one, two, three

Numbers such as *one, five, eleven, two hundred* are cardinal numbers. We most commonly use cardinal numbers as determiners (before nouns). When we use them in this way, we can use other determiners such as articles (*a/an*, *the*) and possessives (*my*, *your*) in front of them. We can use cardinal numbers + *of* before determiners (*one of my friends*):

- *She loves animals and has **two** dogs, **three** cats and **one** rabbit.*
- *My **two** best friends are Amy and Louise.*
- ***Three*** *of his colleagues were sacked yesterday.* (sacked = lost their jobs)

We also use cardinal numbers as nouns:

- *The children arrived in **twos** and **threes**.*

### Large numbers

We normally say *a hundred, a thousand, a million*. We only say *one hundred, one thousand* and *one million* when we want to emphasise the number:

- *What would you do if you won **a*** ***million** euros?* (preferred to *one million euros*)
- *The city is about **a hundred** kilometres from the capital.*

Numbers such as *100, 200, 1,000*, etc. do not take a plural -*s* when we use them as determiners:

- *There were about two **hundred** people at the meeting.*
- Not: *~~There were about two hundreds people~~* …

However, we use the plural forms *hundreds*, *thousands*, *millions* + *of* + noun to refer to large, non-specific numbers:

- *It’s happened **hundreds*** ***of** times.*
- ***Millions*** ***of*** *people live in poverty.*

We often use commas in writing to separate long numbers of a thousand or more into each thousand part:

- *The repairs cost £1,250.*
- *A total of $5,000,000 was spent on the project.*
