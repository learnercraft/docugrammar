# Names and titles: addressing people

When we talk to someone directly, we use names and titles:

- *Hello, **John**, how are you?*
- ***Professor Sana****, there’s someone to see you.*

When we are talking about people, we use different forms depending on our relationship with them.

We use first names only in informal situations:

- A: *I saw **Mel** earlier today*.
- B: *Did you? I haven’t seen her for weeks*.

We use first name + family name (surname) when we are not sure if the person we are talking to knows who we’re talking about:

- *Do you know **Simon Perry**?*
- ***Joy Goodfellow*** *had to go to hospital today. I’m not sure why.*

We use a title (*Mr*, *Mrs*, *Ms*, *Dr*, *Prof*) and the surname in more formal situations. We don’t usually use the title alone, or the title and first name (although we sometimes use a job title):

- ***Dr O’Donnell****, can I ask you a question?*
- Not: *~~Dr David, can I ask …?~~*

- *Could you ask **Mrs Zatta** to call me when she gets back?*
- Not: *~~Could you ask Mrs to call me …?~~*

We use *Mr* /ˈmɪstə(r)/ for men. We do not usually write ‘Mister’ in full. We use *Mrs* /ˈmɪsɪz/ for married women.

*Ms* /məz/ does not indicate if the person is married or not. Some women take on their husband’s surname and the title *Mrs* when they get married. Some women prefer to keep their surname and use the title *Ms*.

In formal contexts, we sometimes use *Master* for boys and *Miss* for girls. *Miss* also indicates single status (not married). The use of *Miss* is becoming less common among younger women, and *Master* now sounds old-fashioned.

### Parents and grandparents

We use *mother* (usually formal), *mum, mam, mummy* (less formal) *mom* (American English) to talk to a mother, and *father* (usually formal), *dad, daddy, papa* (less formal) to address a father. For a grandmother we use *gran, grandma, nana, nan*, and for grandfather we use *grandad*, *grandpa, granpy, gramps*, *pops*:

- ***Mum****, you’re going to be really pleased to hear this.*
- *I can borrow your car, can’t I, **Gran**?*

### Terms of endearment

We use terms of endearment for people we are very close to or to whom we want to show affection or friendship. They include: *darling, dear, poppet* (usually to a little child), *love, luvvie, sweetheart*. They may combine with names:

- *Can you lock the car, **darling**?*
- *Peter, **love**, could you take this to the post-box for me?*

### Groups of people

We use *folks, guys, everyone/everybody, children, boys, lads, girls, ladies, gentlemen* to address groups. Some of these are more formal. For example, *ladies and gentlemen* is more formal than *folks* or *guys*. *Guys* is used more and more for groups of both sexes, not just males:

- *OK, **boys**, could you all wait in the main hall, please.*
- ***Everybody****, could you all hand in your evaluations as you leave, please.*
- *Come, on **guys**, come and help!*

### Very polite terms of address

We use *sir* or *madam* most often in places such as shops or hotels where a service is being given. We use *sir* and *miss* to address male and female school teachers (but not teachers in higher education):

- \[in a shop: a shop assistant is addressing a customer\]
- *How can I help you, **madam**?*
- \[in a school classroom: a pupil is addressing the teacher\]
- ***Sir****, she keeps talking all the time.*

### Addressing strangers

English does not have a standard polite way of addressing strangers. For example, it is very difficult to know how to attract the attention of a stranger. *Hello, sorry* or *excuse me* are most likely to be used. *Sir! Madam!* are not commonly used:

- ***Sorry****, you’ve dropped your scarf.*
- ***Excuse me****, are you a friend of Sheila’s?*

### Job titles

We don’t normally call people by the name of their job or profession. Some jobs or professions which we can use as terms of address are: *doctor* (medical), *driver, nurse, minister, officer, waiter*:

- *Do you think it’s serious, **doctor**?*
- *Now, **minister**, can you explain this policy to us?*
- *Excuse me, **waiter**, sorry, could I have some more bread, please?*

We use *Dr* /ˈdɒk.tə(r)/ for medical doctors and people with a doctorate qualification (PhD). We use a wide range of titles for jobs. Some common ones in business management are:

- Chief Executive Officer CEO /si: i:əʊ/
- Managing Director MD /em ˈdi:/
- Financial Director FD /ef di:/
- Chief Technical Officer CTO /si: ti: əʊ/
- Vice-President VP /vi: ˈpi:/ (especially in the USA)
- Chair/Chairperson/Chairman /ˈtʃeəmən/

We often use abbreviations:

- *Kapor was founder and **CEO** of Lotus.*
