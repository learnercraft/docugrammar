# Adverbs as short responses (definitely, certainly)

## Attitude and viewpoint

Spoken English:

We often use some adverbs in speaking as short responses to show attitude or viewpoint:

- A: *You know DVDs? Can you record onto them?*
- B: ***Absolutely***.
- A: *Dr Kahn is very nice. He’s very interested in his patients*.
- B: *Oh, do you think so?*
- A: ***Definitely***.
- A: *There might be a film on at 2 pm that we could watch*.
- B: *Yeah*, ***probably***.
- A: *Mandy isn’t going because she just doesn’t like Rick*.
- B: ***Exactly***.
- A: *Maybe she bought two of the same sweaters in case something happened to one*.
- B: *Yeah*, ***possibly***.
- A: *It should be called ‘English Test’ not ‘Test of English’*.
- B: ***Precisely***.

Spoken English:

We often use *not really* in this way to soften a *no*\-answer:

- A: *Do you not like chocolate?*
- B: *No*, ***not really***.

## Replies to requests

We use *certainly* and *of course* typically as a reply to a request for a service or favour:

- A: *Can I have the bill please?*
- B: ***Certainly***.
- \[in a clothes shop\]
- A: *Is it OK if I try these on?*
- B: ***Of course***.

## Intensifying adverbs

We often use adverbs that make the meaning stronger (*very, extremely, really*) as a short response:

- A: *He’s an intelligent dog, isn’t he?*
- B: *Yes*, ***very****/**extremely**/****highly***.
