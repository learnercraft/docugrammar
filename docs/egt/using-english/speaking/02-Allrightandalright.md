# All right and alright

*All right* is an adjective or adverb.

## All right as an adjective

We use *all right* as an adjective after verbs such as *be, feel, seem* or *look*, but not before a noun (predicative adjective). It means ‘well’, ‘OK’, ‘satisfactory’:

- A: *How are you?*
- B: *I’m* ***all right***.
- A: *Is everything **all right**?*
- B: *Yes, fine thanks*.
- *Was your meal **all right**?*
- Not: *~~Was it an all right meal?~~*

*All right* may be written as *alright*, but *all right* is more common:

- *There was an accident and the bus driver was injured, but all the passengers were **alright**.*

## All right as an adverb

We use *all right* as an adverb to mean ‘well’, ‘OK’, ‘satisfactorily’:

- *Jill is really worried about her driving test, but I think she’s doing **all right**.*
- A: *Is everything going **all right** for you these days?*
- B: *Yes, business is good*.

## All right as a discourse marker

We use *all right* to show that we want to begin a new topic or a new action:

- ***All right****, can we start the music now please?*

We also use *all right* to show that we accept a point of view, or agree with what needs to be done:

- ***All right****, you have a point but I still think we need to get more advice.*

We can also use *all right* as a question to follow up a statement. This is informal:

- A: *I think I’ll leave at 5*. ***All right****?*
- B: *Yes, that’s okay with me*.
