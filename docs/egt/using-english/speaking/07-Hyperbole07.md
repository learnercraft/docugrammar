# Hyperbole

We use hyperbole /haɪˈpɜ:bəlɪ/ to exaggerate. We sometimes do this to emphasise something, to add humour or to gain attention. When we use hyperbole, we often make statements which are obviously untrue:

- *We drove for hours without stopping and I nearly **died of** hunger.*
- \[two students talking about a university town\]
- *I have lived in Nottingham since I came here to study at the university. Been here for about **a thousand** years.*

We often use hyperbole to stress a particular feature such as amount, size, shape and movement:

- *I’ve got **tons** of homework to do.*
- *You have to wait for **hours** in that bank.*
- *Every car in America is **at least ten times** the size of ones in Europe.*
- \[A talks about unexpectedly discovering a special Sunday sale at a department store. The department store is called Woolworth’s.\]
- A: *There were **millions** of people in Woolworth’s*.
- B: *Really? On a Sunday!!*
- *There were **millions** of people in town on Saturday.*
