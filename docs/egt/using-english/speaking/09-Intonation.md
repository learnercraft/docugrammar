# Intonation

Intonation describes how the voice rises and falls in speech. The three main patterns of intonation in English are: falling intonation, rising intonation and fall-rise intonation.

## Falling intonation

Falling intonation describes how the voice falls on the final stressed syllable of a phrase or a group of words. A falling intonation is very common in *wh*\-questions.

- *Where’s the nearest p*↘*ost-office?*
- *What time does the film f*↘*inish?*

We also use falling intonation when we say something definite, or when we want to be very clear about something:

- *I think we are completely l*↘*ost.*
- *OK, here’s the magaz*↘*ine you wanted.*

## Rising intonation

Rising intonation describes how the voice rises at the end of a sentence. Rising intonation is common in *yes-no* questions:

- *I hear the Health Centre is expanding. So, is that the new d*↗*octor?*
- *Are you th*↗*irsty?*

## Fall-rise intonation

Fall-rise intonation describes how the voice falls and then rises. We use fall-rise intonation at the end of statements when we want to say that we are not sure, or when we may have more to add:

- *I do*↘*n’t support any football team at the m*↘*om*↗*ent.* (but I may change my mind in future).
- *It rained every day in the firs*↘*t w*↗*eek.* (but things improved after that).

We use fall-rise intonation with questions, especially when we request information or invite somebody to do or to have something. The intonation pattern makes the questions sound more polite:

- *Is this your cam*↘*er*↗*a?*
- *Would you like another co*↘*ff*↗*ee?*
