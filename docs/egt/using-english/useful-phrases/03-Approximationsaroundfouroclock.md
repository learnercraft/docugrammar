# Approximations (around four o’clock)

When we speak, we often try not to be too exact or factual because it can sound very direct. As a result, we add expressions to make what we say more approximate or vague.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>I’ve lived here </i><b><i>for two years and four months</i></b><i>.</i></td><td>This might sound too factual or exact.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I’ve lived here </i><b><i>for almost two and a half years</i></b><i>.</i></td><td>This is more approximate and sounds less factual and exact.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Before a number

- *We’ll pick you up **around** six.*
- *In this country, we usually have dinner at **about** seven o’clock.*
- A: *How long have you been living here?*
- B: *For **about** three years*.
- ***Roughly*** *30 people are coming to my graduation party.*
- ***Up to*** *20 people are still missing after the earthquake.*
- *She said she’d call here **at or around** ten o’clock.*

We also use approximation in formal speech and writing:

- *The accident occurred at **approximately** 9 am.*
- ***In the region of*** *40 jobs are to be lost at the factory.*
- ***As many as*** *300 people were on the train when it broke down.*

## After a number

### Number + -odd

- ***Forty-odd*** *people turned up at the demonstration.* (at least 40 and maybe more)
- A: *How much oil does the tank hold?*
- B: *I’m not sure*. ***Fifty-odd*** *litres, I’d say*. (at least 50 litres and maybe more)

We do not use *\-odd* to talk about time:

- *It’s **about** seven o’clock at least.*
- Not: … ~~seven-odd o’clock~~ …

### Number + head noun \+ or so

- A: *Can I have a lift to town with you?*
- B: *Absolutely. I’ll be leaving in* ***ten minutes or so***.

### Number + head noun \+ or something

- A: *What’s the weight limit for luggage?*
- B: ***20 kilos or something***.

### Number + head noun \+ or thereabouts (more formal)

- \[someone is giving directions\]
- *Once you get to the school, turn left and our house is the first one on the left, **half a mile, or thereabouts**, up that road.*

### Number + more or less (informal speaking)

- *This is going to cost **four hundred pounds, more or less**.* (preferred to *This is going to cost more or less four hundred pounds*.)

### Using or between numbers

- *The bus from the airport usually costs just **three or four** pounds.*

### Adding the suffix -ish (informal speaking)

- A: *What time are we going out?*
- B: *I think Linda said that she’d pick us up at* ***sixish***.
- A: *What age are Gabriela’s children?*
- B: *Her daughter is **fourish** and her son must be at least seven*.
