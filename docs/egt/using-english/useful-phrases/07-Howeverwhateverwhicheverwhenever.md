# However, whatever, whichever, whenever, wherever, whoever

## It doesn’t matter how, what, when, etc

If we add -*ever* to *wh*\-words like *how, what, which, when, where* and *who*, we change their meaning.

***However*** *you try to explain it, I still can’t understand it.* (Any way at all that you try to explain it … /It doesn’t matter how you try …)

*Please take **whatever** you want from the fridge if you feel hungry.* (anything at all that you want)

***Whatever*** *you do, don’t lose this key.*

*Choose **whichever** time suits you best then write your name against that time on the list.*

*Call in **whenever** you like. I’m always at home.* (at any time at all that you like)

***Wherever*** *you live, you have the right to a good postal service.* (it doesn’t matter where you live)

***Whoever*** *you ask, you will get the same answer: no.* (any person you ask/it doesn’t matter who you ask)

## Emphasising questions

We can use *wh*\-words with -*ever* to ask very emphatic questions. In speaking, we stress -*ever*:

- ***However*** *will you manage to live on such a small income?* (stronger than *How will you manage* …*?*)
- *Charlie, **whatever** are you doing?* (stronger than *What are you doing?*)
- ***Whenever*** *are you going to stop complaining? You’re getting on everyone’s nerves!*

## Being vague: whatever, whenever, wherever, whoever

We can use *whatever, whenever, wherever* and *whoever* alone to refer in a non-specific way to people and things:

- A: *Shall I send you all the dates and times?*
- B: *Yes*, ***whatever***. *That would be useful. Thanks*. (it doesn’t matter what you send)
- A: *What time shall I come?*
- B: ***Whenever***, *really*. (no specific time/it doesn’t matter)
- *If you talk to the manager **or whoever**, you’ll be able to find out what’s happening.* (talk to the manager or a similar, unspecified person)

Sometimes people use *whatever* in a sarcastic or disrespectful way, usually saying it in an exaggerated way, to show they are not interested (for example, with exaggerated intonation):

- Parent: *You’d better start saving money if you want to go to university!*
- Teenager: ***Whatever!***

## Whatsoever

*Whatsoever* is an emphatic form of *whatever*. It is most common after a negative phrase:

- *He seems to have no ambitions **whatsoever**.*
- *I can see no reason **whatsoever** why she should not attend classes.*
