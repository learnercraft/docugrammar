# More or less

*More or less* means ‘mostly’, ‘nearly’ or ‘approximately’. We use it in mid position (between the subject and main verb, or after the modal verb or first auxiliary verb, or after *be* as a main verb). It is slightly informal:

- *We had **more or less** finished, so we decided to go for lunch.*

We commonly use it after numbers and measurements:

- *It should cost you about £100, **more or less**.*

:::warning

We don’t normally use *more or less* before people’s ages:

- *She’s **about** 35, I think.*
- Not: *~~She’s more or less 35.~~*
