# Point of view

We use the expression *from x’s point of view* to talk about a way of considering something and/or how it affects someone or something:

- ***From my point of view****, nine-thirty would be better than nine o’clock, as I have to drop the children off at school for nine.*
- Not: *~~To/In my point of view,~~* …
- ***From an environmental point of view****, a hybrid car is better than a petrol or diesel car.*

We use the noun phrase *point of view* to mean ‘opinion’. The plural is *points of view*:

- *We all have different **points of view** on how we should prevent crime.*
