# It, this and that in paragraphs

We use *it*, *this* and *that* to introduce further information about a topic already mentioned. However, the words have different uses.

We use *it* to continue to refer to the topic we are already writing or speaking about:

- *The heart is the central organ in our bodies. **It** is used to pump oxygen around the body through the bloodstream.* (*It* refers back to *The heart*)
- *The new album by ‘The Noughts’ went on sale yesterday. **It** is their third album in three years and is set to become as great a success as previous releases.*

:::warning

We don’t use *it* when we first give information about a topic, for example immediately after a chapter or section title in a text:

- *(b) Green application form*
- ***This*** *must be signed by all applicants and returned by 30 November 2009.*
- Not: *~~It must be signed~~* …

:::

We can use *this* to refer back to whole clauses and sentences and to previous parts of a text. *This* highlights the information referred to much more strongly than *it*. Writers often use *this* when a point or idea is to become an important part of the discussion that follows:

- *More and more people are discovering that Tai Chi is one of the most valuable forms of exercise. **This** has led to a big demand for classes.* (*This* refers back to a whole sentence.)
- *Heavy rains and stormy conditions throughout the summer have led to severe shortages in strawberries and other soft fruits. **This** has led to price rises in many supermarkets and shops.*

We use *that* in a similar way to *this*. However, when we use *that*, we distance ourselves more from the topic or from aspects of the topic:

- *For many traditional football supporters, it is a problem that so many young girls and women attend football matches these days. **That** is a sexist attitude of course.*

*That* is also used to refer to ideas associated with another person:

- *The chairman apologised for the poor performance of the company and promised a better future for investors. **That** was a promise many people felt he could not possibly keep.*
