# Verbs: formation

## Identifying verbs

It is not always possible to identify a verb by its form. However, some word-endings (suffixes) can show that the word is probably a verb.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>suffix</td><td>examples</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>-ate</i></td><td><i>appreciate, celebrate, congratulate</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>-en</i></td><td><i>frighten, soften, widen</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>-ify</i></td><td><i>identify, specify, qualify</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>-ise/-ize*</i></td><td><i>realise, recognise, modernize</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

\*Both forms are used, but the -*ise* form is more common in British English and the -*ize* form is more common in American English.

## Typical verb prefixes

Verbs often also have these typical prefixes.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>prefix</td><td>examples</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>ad-</i></td><td><i>adapt, admit, advance</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>de-</i></td><td><i>deceive, deform, describe</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>im-/in-</i></td><td><i>impose, increase, inform</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>per-</i></td><td><i>perform, persuade, perceive</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>re-</i></td><td><i>recall, receive, reproduce</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

However, some words beginning with these prefixes may belong to other word classes (e.g. *increase* \[noun\], *reception* \[noun\]). A good learner’s dictionary will tell you whether a word is a verb.

Verbs sometimes have the same form as nouns or adjectives.

### Verbs related to nouns

- *Could you **hand** me the dictionary?*
- *We should **position** the noticeboard where everyone can see it.*
- *I’ll **email** Sally to see if she is free on Thursday.*

### Verbs related to adjectives

- *I needed to **calm** my nerves before the interview.*
- *The government hopes to **slow** the growth in road traffic over the next five years.*
- *As they get older, most people’s hair starts to **thin**.*

## Compound verbs

Compound verbs are two words which combine to make one meaning. The first word is usually a noun, an adjective or a preposition, and the second word is a verb. The words are sometimes written as one word and sometimes joined by hyphens. A good learner’s dictionary will tell you how the compound is normally written:

- *hand-wash (noun + verb)*
- *highlight (adjective + verb)*
- *overcome (preposition + verb)*
- *Sorry, I was **daydreaming**. What did you say?*
- *Do you have to **hand-wash** this sweater or can it go in the washing machine?*
- *The airline **upgraded** me to business class.*

Compound verbs are much less common than compound nouns or compound adjectives.
