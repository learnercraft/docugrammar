# Finite and non-finite verbs

Finite verb forms show tense, person and number (*I go, she goes, we went*, etc.):

- *She **was waiting** in the room before he **came** in.*
- ***Does*** *your brother **know** my brother?*
- *The night before he **had** to leave, they **sat** on the small sofa in the living-room and **looked** at old family photos.*
- ***Aren’t*** *you a bit late?*

Non-finite verb forms do not show tense, person or number. Typically they are infinitive forms with and without *to* (e.g. *to go, go*), -*ing* forms and -*ed* forms (e.g. *going, gone*):

- *She tiptoed round the house so as not **to wake** anyone.*
- *You need to paint the whole cupboard, **starting** from the bottom.*
- \[from a biography\]
- ***Taken*** *prisoner by the British in December 1776, he was held in New York City for a year …*
