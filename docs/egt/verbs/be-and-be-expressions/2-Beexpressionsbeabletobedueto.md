# Be expressions (be able to, be due to)

## Be about to

*Be about to* is used to talk about things which are going to happen very soon:

- *I**’m about to** eat. Can I phone you back?*

It is often used with *just*:

- *We**’re just about to** set off for a walk. Do you want to come?*

When used in the past, *be about to* can refer to things that were going to happen but didn’t:

- *I **was about to** complain but he came over and apologised.*

We don’t use *be about to* with time expressions:

- *I **was about to** call you.*
- Not: *~~I was about to call you in ten minutes.~~*

## Be able to

### Abilities

*Be able to* is like *can*. We use it to talk about abilities. We often use it in places where it is not possible to use *can*. For example, it isn’t possible to use *can* after another modal verb:

- *She **won’t be able to** concentrate.*
- Not: *~~She won’t can concentrate.~~*

- *He **should be able to** work in a team.*
- Not: *~~He should can work in a team.~~*

*Be able to* is a more formal alternative to *can*:

- *I am very sorry but I **am not able to** give you that information.* (or, less formal: *I cannot give you that information*.)

### Past achievement: could or was/were able to?

We usually use *was/were able to*, not *could* to talk about past achievements in affirmative clauses. This is because they are facts, rather than possibilities:

- *Only one person **was able to** beat the record.*
- Not: *~~Only one person could beat the record.~~*

We use *couldn’t* or, more formally, *wasn’t/weren’t able to* in negative clauses:

- *We **weren’t able to** finish the marathon in under four hours.* (or *We **couldn’t** finish the marathon …*)

## Be due to

*Be due to* is used to talk about things that are expected or planned to happen at a certain time. We often use it with a time expression:

- ***Are*** *you **due to** hand in homework today?*
- *The train is **due to** arrive at Glasgow Central at 12:12.*

## Be likely to

*Be likely to* is used to talk about how probable things are:

- ***Are*** *parents who have a lot of money **likely to** spoil their children?*

It is often used to make comparisons with words like *more* and *less*:

- *I think men **are more likely to** spend a lot of money on food than women are.*
- A: *I liked Budapest as well*.
- B: *Yeah. I**’m** probably **less likely to** go back there than to Prague*.

We also use *it’s likely* followed by *that* + clause:

- ***It’s likely that*** *sales will rise.*

We form the negative of *be likely to* and *be likely that* either with *not* or with *unlikely*. *Unlikely* is more formal:

- *The company is **not likely to** make a profit in the second half of the year.*
- *People are **unlikely to** listen to him now because they know he lied.*

## Be meant to

*Be meant to* is used to talk about what is desirable, expected or intended:

- A: *It looks green to me*.
- B: *Oh*, ***is*** *it **meant to** be a different colour?*
- *It **was meant to** be like a quiz and we were all in different teams and there **was meant to** be a fantastic prize.*

## Be supposed to

*Be supposed to* is used to talk about obligations and arrangements:

- *Where were you? You **were supposed to be** at the party!*
- *You**’re supposed to have** an hour for lunch. That’s the law.*

It’s also used to talk about people’s expectations or beliefs about something:

- \[talking about some medicine\]
- A: *Take some of this*.
- B: *What**’s** it **supposed to** do?* (*What does it do to you?*)
- *And then I’m gonna get a train over to Brussels which takes all day as well. It**’s supposed to** be a nice route with forests and mountains and things.* (*gonna* represents ‘going to’, as it is pronounced in informal speaking.)
