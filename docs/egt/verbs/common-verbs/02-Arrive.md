# Arrive

We use the verb *arrive* with *at* or *in* to talk about ‘coming to’, ‘getting to’ or ‘reaching’ a place where a journey ends. If we see the destination as a point, we say *arrive at*. If we see it as a larger area, we say *arrive in*:

- *We **arrived at** the art gallery just as it was closing.* (The gallery is seen as a point.)
- *Immigrants who **arrived in** the country after 2005 have to take a special language test.* (The country is seen as a larger area.)

:::warning

We don’t say *arrive to* a place:

- *I always **arrive at** college about half an hour before my classes start.*
- Not: *~~I always arrive to college~~* …
