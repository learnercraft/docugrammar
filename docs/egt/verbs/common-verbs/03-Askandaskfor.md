# Ask and ask for

## Ask

*Ask* is a verb meaning ‘put a question or seek an answer from someone’:

- *Can I **ask** you a question?*
- *He **asked** me what age I was.*
- *‘How are you?’ she **asked**.*

### Ask \+ to-infinitive

We can use *ask* with the *to-*infinitive to talk about requesting something:

- *She **asked to see** Professor Fenton.* (ask + *to*\-infinitive)
- *We **asked** the City Council **to help** us organise a sports day.* (ask + object + *to-infinitive)*.

## Ask for

If you *ask for* something, it means that you want someone to give you something:

- *I always **ask for** extra tomato sauce on my pizza.*
- *They **asked** their boss **for** more money, but he refused.*

:::warning

Don’t confuse *ask for* and *demand. Demand* means ‘ask for something forcefully’, in a way that shows we are not expecting a refusal:

- *We are writing to **ask for** your help in finding suitable accommodation in New Haven.*
- Not: *~~We are writing to demand~~* …

:::

## Ask and ask for: typical error

We use *for* when we request someone to give us something:

- *I called them to **ask for** more details.*
- Not: *~~I called them to ask more details.~~*
