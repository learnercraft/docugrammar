# Enable

When you *enable* something, you make it possible for something to happen:

- *The new machines have **enabled** the company to increase production by over 20%.*
- *Text messages **enable** people to keep in contact easily and cheaply.*

*Enable* can be used in the passive voice:

- *As a result of the procedure, oxygen **is enabled** to pass into the bloodstream.*

*Enable* is followed by direct object and the *to*\-infinitive:

- *I shall always be grateful. He **enabled** me to have confidence in my ability to paint.*
- Not: … ~~enabled me have confidence~~ …
