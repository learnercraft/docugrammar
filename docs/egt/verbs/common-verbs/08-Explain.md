# Explain

We use the verb *explain* to mean ‘make something clear or easy to understand, by describing or giving information about it’.

We can use *explain* with a direct object or with a direct object and a prepositional phrase with *to* (direct objects are underlined):

- *Could you* ***explain*** this diagram*, please?*
- *Can you **explain*** the route ***to me**?*
- Not: *~~Can you explain me the route?~~*
- *We **explained*** the situation ***to the team**.*
- Not: *~~We explained the team the situation.~~*

:::warning

We don’t use the indirect + direct object construction with *explain*:

- *Would you please **explain** these numbers to me?*
- Not: *~~Would you please explain me these numbers?~~*

:::

We don’t use *explain* to mean ‘describe’. *Describe* means ‘say or write what someone or something is like’. If we explain something, we give a reason for it or say how it works:

- *To **describe** myself, I am very honest and a workaholic.*
- Not: *~~To explain myself~~* …
