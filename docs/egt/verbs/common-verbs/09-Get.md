# Get

*Get* is an irregular verb. Its three parts are *get, got, got*. In American English, the -*ed* form *gotten* is common.

*Get* is a very common verb, especially in informal speaking and writing. *Get* has many different meanings and is used in many idioms. We use it less often in formal writing. *Get* has many different grammatical patterns depending on the meaning.

## Get meaning ‘fetch’, ‘receive’, ‘obtain’

We commonly use *get* + object or *get* + indirect object + direct object when we mean, very generally, ‘fetch’ or ‘receive’ or ‘obtain’. In these examples the object is underlined:

- *When are you going to* ***get*** your new car*?*
- *They were all dismissed from the firm but two of them managed to* ***get*** new jobs *within a week.*

These examples have an indirect object (io) and a direct object (do):

- *Can you **get** \[IO\] me \[DO\] an ice-cream? Thanks.*
- *Can we stop here? I need to **get** \[IO\] Fiona and Steven \[DO\] some cash from the cash machine.*

## Get meaning ‘become’

We commonly use *get* + adjective to mean ‘become’ or to describe a change of state or situation:

- *Put your coat and scarf on or you’ll **get** cold.*
- *Let’s hope she **gets** better soon.*
- *It’s **getting** dark.*

## Get describing negative events

We can use *get* + *\-ed* form to describe things that happen to us, often things which are unfortunate and which we don’t want to happen. We call this pattern the *get passive*:

- *The cottage **got** really badly damaged in the floods last year.*
- *Sorry we’re late. The train **got** delayed for over an hour outside Manchester.*

## Get meaning ‘cause something to happen’

When we use *get* + object (o) + *\-ed* form, we say that we cause something to happen or to be done. It is a less formal way of saying *have something done*:

- *I’m **getting** the computer **repaired** on Monday.*
- *I’m going to the supermarket so I’ll **get** your jacket **cleaned** if you like.*

We also use *get* + noun phrase object (o) + object complement (oc) to mean that we cause something to happen:

- \[at a hotel reception desk\]
- *Sorry to keep you waiting. We’re just **getting** \[O\] the bill \[OC\] ready for you now.*

*Get* + object + infinitive with *to*, and *get* + object + -*ing* form have similar meanings of ‘cause or persuade to happen’:

- *They **got** me **to talk** to the police, even though I knew it wouldn’t help.* (They persuaded me to talk to the police …)
- *Can you help me **get** this printer work**ing**?*
