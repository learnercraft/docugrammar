# Happen

*Happen* means ‘occur’ and most commonly ‘occur by chance’:

- *What will **happen** if it rains?*
- *Will someone tell me what’s **happened**?*
- A: *You haven’t been out in ages. When did you last go to the cinema?*
- B: *It just **happened** that we went to see that new film last night*.

*Happen* + *to*\-infinitive is common in polite requests or to describe something that occurs by chance:

- *You don’t **happen** to have any stamps, do you?*
- *They just **happened** to be driving past so they stopped and had lunch and told us all about their holiday.*

We use *happen* + *to* + object to say that something occurs unexpectedly or something occurs that we do not want:

- *Something’s* ***happened to*** my bike*. The brakes keep squeaking.*
- *What’s **happened** to your jacket? It’s all covered in mud.*
