# Hate, like, love and prefer

We can use *hate, like, love* and *prefer* with an -*ing* form or with a *to*\-infinitive:

- *I **hate** to see food being thrown away.*
- *I **love** going to the cinema.*
- *I **prefer** listening to the news on radio than watching it on TV.*
- *He **prefers** not to wear a tie to work.*

In American English, the forms with *to*\-infinitive are much more common than the -*ing* form.

There is a very small difference in meaning between the two forms. The *\-ing* form emphasises the action or experience. The *to*\-infinitive gives more emphasis to the results of the action or event. We often use the -*ing* form to suggest enjoyment (or lack of it), and the *to*\-infinitive form to express habits or preferences.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>I </i><b><i>like</i></b><i> making jam.</i><i>He </i><b><i>likes</i></b><i> telling jokes.</i><i>They don’t </i><b><i>like</i></b><i> sitting for too long.</i></td><td>emphasis on the experience/action</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>We have a lot of fruit in the garden. I </i><b><i>like</i></b><i> to make jam every year.</i><i>I </i><b><i>prefer</i></b><i> to sort out a problem as soon as I can.</i><i>If you </i><b><i>prefer</i></b><i> not to go camping there are youth hostels nearby.</i></td><td>a habit or preference</td></tr></tbody></table>

The -*ing* form is more common than the *to*\-infinitive form after *hate* and *love*:

- *I **hate** decorating. I’d rather pay a professional to do it.*

## Would \+ hate, like, love, prefer

When we use *would* or *’d* with *hate, like, love, prefer*, we use the *to*\-infinitive, not the *\-ing* form:

- *We **would love** to hear you sing.*
- Not: *~~We would love hearing you sing.~~*

- *They**’d hate** to cause a problem.*
- Not: *~~They’d hate causing a problem.~~*

- *I’**d prefer** not to give you my name.*
- Not: *~~I’d prefer not giving you my name.~~*
