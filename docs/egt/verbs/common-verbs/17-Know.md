# Know

We commonly use the verb *know* with a noun phrase, with a *that*\-clause or with a *wh-*clause (e.g. *who*, *where*, *why*):

- *Do you **know** the music shop just by the market square?* (+ object)
- *We **know** that this must be a difficult decision for you.* (+ *that* clause)
- *Do you **know** where to buy batteries for the watch?* (+ *wh-*clause)

We don’t use continuous forms of *know*:

- *She’s a really good teacher and **knows** the names of over two hundred of her students.*
- Not: … ~~and is knowing the names of~~ ….

- *We’ve **known** each other since we were children.*
- Not: *~~We’ve been knowing each other~~* …

## Know how \+ infinitive

We do not commonly use *know* + *to-*infinitive. We use *know how* + *to-*infinitive:

- *Does he **know how to play** classical guitar music?*
- Not: *~~Does he know to play~~* …

## Know \+ object + infinitive

In very formal English, we use *know* + object + *to-*infinitive:

- \[extract from a reference for a job\]
- *I have worked with John Davidson for five years and **know him to be** reliable and hard-working.*
- *Weather experts have never **known it to snow** as heavily as it has this spring.*

## Know without an object

To refer to general knowledge, we use *know* without an object:

- A: *They’re opening a new terminal at Amsterdam airport*.
- B: *Yes, I* ***know***. (I know that they are opening a new terminal.)

We use *know* + object to refer to what we know from personal experience:

- A: *They’re opening a new terminal at Amsterdam airport*.
- B: *Yes, I **know** it*. (I know the one you mean. I have been there and seen the airport.)

We also sometimes use *know about* or *know of* when we say what we know from general experience (*know of* is more formal):

- *What do you **know about** the origins of the American Civil War?*
- Not: *~~What do you know the origins~~* …

## You know

We use *you know* very often in speaking as a discourse marker. We use it to check that the people we are speaking to share the same knowledge as us and understand what we are saying:

- *It’s impossible to find time to go to the gym, **you know**, every day, isn’t it?*
