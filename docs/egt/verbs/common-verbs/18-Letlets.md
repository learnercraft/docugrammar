# Let, let’s

## Let: permission

We use *let* to talk about permission. *Let* is followed by an object and an infinitive without *to*:

- *She **let** me look at the photos.*
- Not: *~~She let me to look~~* …
- *She’d live on pizzas if we **let** her.*

:::warning

We don’t use *let* in the passive with this meaning:

- *They didn’t **let** us take photographs inside the theatre.* (or *We weren’t allowed to take photographs* …)
- Not: *~~We weren’t let (to) take photographs~~*

## Let’s, let: suggestions, offers, imperatives

*Let us* is the first person plural imperative, which we only use in very formal situations. *Let’s* is the short form, which we often use to make suggestions which include ourselves:

- *It’s midday. **Let’s** stop now and have some lunch, shall we?*
- Not: *~~Lets stop now~~* …
- *Okay. We’re all ready. **Let’s go**.*

We also use *let me* (the first person singular imperative) to give a direct, more formal suggestion or offer:

- ***Let me*** *move these books out of your way.*

We use *let* for third person imperatives and for impersonal imperatives:

- ***Let*** *them walk home on their own.* (third person)
- ***Let*** *there be no doubt about it.* (impersonal)

There are two negative forms of *let’s*: *let’s not* and *don’t let’s*. *Let’s not* is more common:

- ***Let’s not*** *argue about money. We can share the costs.*
- ***Don’t let’s*** *throw away the good books with the damaged ones. We can sell them.*

We can use the full forms *let us, let us not* and *do not let us* in very formal situations such as political documents and speeches, and religious and other ceremonies:

- ***Let us*** *remember all those who have died in this terrible conflict.*
- *We must forgive, but **let us not** forget, what happened on that day ten years ago.*
- ***Do not let us*** *deceive ourselves that our economic problems can be easily solved.*

## Let meaning ‘rent’

We use *let* with a direct object meaning ‘rent something to someone’:
