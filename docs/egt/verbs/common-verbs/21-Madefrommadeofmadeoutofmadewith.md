- B: *It’s oak, American white oak*.
- A: *It’s lovely*.

## Made out of

We usually use *made out of* when we talk about something that has been changed or transformed from one thing into another:

- *In the 1970s, it was popular to have candle-holders **made out of** wine bottles.*
- *They were living in tents **made out of** old plastic sheets.*

## Made with

We use *made with* most often to talk about the ingredients of food and drink:

- *This dish is **made with** beef, red peppers and herbs.*
- *Is sushi always **made with** raw fish or do the Japanese use cooked fish too?*
