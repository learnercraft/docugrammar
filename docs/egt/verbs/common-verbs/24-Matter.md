# Matter

We can use *matter* as a verb or a noun. It is a very common word with a number of different uses and grammatical patterns.

## Matter as a verb

### Matter in the negative

The most common use of the verb *matter* is in the expression *it doesn’t matter* (and the less common forms *it didn’t matter, it wouldn’t matter* and *it won’t matter*). *It doesn’t matter* means ‘it is not important’, ‘I don’t mind’ or ‘it is not a problem’:

- A: *I forgot to buy milk when I was in town*.
- B: ***It doesn’t matter***. *We’ve got enough till tomorrow*.
- ***It doesn’t matter*** *if you can’t be here by nine o’clock. We can start without you and you can join us later.*
- ***It wouldn’t matter*** *if we didn’t invite Paul and Jan to the wedding. They wouldn’t expect to be invited.*

### Matter in questions

We can ask questions with *matter*, often followed by an *if*\-clause. Questions with *matter* usually mean ‘Is it a problem?’:

- ***Does it matter*** *if I leave my computer on all night?*
- ***Would it matter*** *which flight we got?*
- A: *I forgot to copy Chris in on the email to Margaret*.
- B: ***Does it matter?***
- A: *I suppose not*.

### Matter in affirmative statements

Less commonly, we can use *matter* in affirmative statements to say that something is important for a particular person, often with *to*:

- A: *Sally says the school buildings are in a bad state*.
- B: *Well, the local authority doesn’t care. Nobody cares*.
- A: *Well* ***it matters to Sally***. *She has to work there*.
- ***It matters to me*** *that my children should be polite to adults.*

## Matter as a noun

### What’s the matter (with …)?

We can use *what’s the matter (with …)?* to ask someone about a problem or to ask for an explanation of a situation that looks problematic:

- \[adult to little child\]
- ***What’s the matter****, darling? Why are you crying?*
- ***What’s the matter with*** *Derek these days? He’s acting so strangely.*

:::warning

We don’t say *the matter is* …, we say *the problem is* …

- *He’d like to live in the USA. **The problem is** he can’t get a visa.*
- Not: *~~The matter is~~* …

:::

When we reply to the question *What’s the matter?*, we don’t use *matter*, we use *problem*:

- A: *What’s the matter with Greg?*
- B: ***The problem*** *is he’s just broken up with his girlfriend. They’ve been together for a long time*.

### Matter as a countable noun

We can use *matter* as a countable noun to mean ‘question, problem or issue’:

- *This is a **matter** for the police. We cannot deal with it ourselves.*
- *It’s only a **matter** of time before everyone will get bored with reality TV shows.*
- *Are there any other **matters** to discuss today, or shall we finish?*

### Matter as an uncountable noun

*Matter* as an uncountable noun means ‘the physical substance that makes up the universe’:

- *How much **matter** is there in the entire universe? Scientists are not absolutely sure.*

### As a matter of fact

We can use the expression *as a matter of fact* to emphasise that something is different from what has been said before, or from what people think or expect:

- A: *I don’t think you like Hilary, do you?*
- B: *No, that’s just not true*. ***As a matter of fact***, *I’m very fond of her. It’s just that she irritates me sometimes*.

### In a matter of \+ time expression

We can use the expression *in a matter of* with a time expression to refer to something that happens very quickly, or which can be done very quickly:

- *It used to take an hour to get to the airport, but now with the new metro line you can get there **in a matter of** minutes.*

## No matter

We can use *no matter* to link two clauses as a conjunction. It is a short form of *it does not matter*. We can use *no matter* with *what, when, where, which, who* and *how* to refer to a situation that cannot be changed, even though we try:

- ***No matter what*** *I wear, I always feel dull and old-fashioned.*
- ***No matter where*** *she looked, she could not find the missing paper.*
- *He never answers emails, **no matter how** many you send him.*

If there is just one clause, we use *it doesn’t matter* before *what*, *when*, *where*, *which*, *who* and *how*:

- A: *There are three phone numbers here for the tax office. Which one do I call?*
- B: ***It doesn’t matter*** *which one you use*.
- Not: *~~No matter which one you use.~~*

We don’t use *no matter* as a conjunction with *if*. We say *it doesn’t matter if*:

- ***It doesn’t matter if*** *you wear a smart suit, they still won’t let you in without a tie.*

## Matter: typical errors

The noun *matter*, meaning ‘question, problem or issue’, is countable:

- *I have some important **matters** to discuss.*
- Not: … ~~some important matter~~ …

The conjunction form is *no matter*. We don’t say *not matter*:

- *I’ll get a job, **no matter** how long it takes.*
- Not: … ~~not matter how long~~ …

- *However*, *whatever*, *whichever*, *whenever*, *wherever*, *whoever*
