# Need

*Need* is a semi-modal verb because in some ways it is like a modal verb and in other ways like a main verb.

We use *need* mostly in the negative form to indicate that there is no obligation or necessity to do something:

- *You **needn’t** take off your shoes.*

## Need: form

### Affirmative form

Affirmatives with the semi-modal *need* are not common and they are used in formal contexts. There is almost always a negative word (e.g. *no one, nobody, nothing*) or phrase in the clause, even if the verb phrase is affirmative:

- *No one **need** think that we are doing this every week.* (we are not doing this every week)
- *Nobody **need** know the name of the person who made the complaint.*
- *Not a thing **need** change on this page.*

*Need* comes first in the verb phrase (after the subject and before another verb):

- *Let’s forget about it. No one **need** know about it.*

We can’t use another modal verb with *need*:

- *No one **need** read this.*
- Not: *~~No one need must read this~~. or ~~No one must need read this~~*.

### Negative form

:::warning

We form the negative by adding *not* after *need*. *Need not* can be contracted to *needn’t*. We don’t use *don’t*/*doesn’t/didn’t* with the semi-modal verb *need*:

- *You **need not** spend a lot of money on presents.* (formal) (or *You needn’t spend a lot of money on presents*.)
- Not: *~~You don’t need spend a lot of money on presents.~~*

### Question form

The question form of the semi-modal *need* is not very common. It is rather formal. The subject and *need* change position to form questions. We don’t use *do/does/did*.

- ***Need*** *we write this down?*
- Not: *~~Do we need write this down?~~*

## Need: use

### No obligation (needn’t)

The semi-modal *need* is most common in the negative. We use it to show that there is no obligation:

- *We **needn’t** spend much time on this topic. It’s not going to be in the exam.*
- *Cans of soup **needn’t** be kept in the fridge.*

### No obligation in the past

The semi-modal *need* has no past simple form. Instead, we use *didn’t need to* or *didn’t have to* when we express no obligation in the past:

- *I **didn’t need to** buy any books. They were all in the library.* (main verb *need* + *to*)
- (or *I **didn’t have to** buy any books. They were all in the library*.)
- Not: *~~I didn’t need buy any books. They were all in the library.~~*

### Unnecessary events

We use *needn’t have + -ed* form to refer to events which happened but which the speaker considers were unnecessary:

- *You **needn’t have waited** for me.* (You waited for me but it wasn’t necessary.)
- *You **needn’t have bought** so much food. There are only three of us staying for the weekend.* (You bought a lot of food but it wasn’t necessary.)

## Semi-modal need and main verb need

We can use main verb *need* as an alternative to semi-modal *need*. Main verb *need* is followed by *to* and it changes with person, number and tense (*I, you, we, they need to; she, he, it needs to; I, you, she, he, it, we, they needed to*).

:::warning

We must use the main verb *need* when it is followed by a noun phrase or -*ing* clause:

- *You **don’t need** \[noun phrase\]an umbrella.*
- Not: *~~You needn’t an umbrella.~~*

- *My hair **doesn’t need** \[-ing clause\]cutting for at least another month.*
- Not: *~~My hair needn’t cutting for at least another month.~~*

:::

## Typical error

The main verb *need* is followed by *to* when used with another verb.

- *I **need to** have my hair cut.*
- Not: *~~I need have my hair cut.~~*
