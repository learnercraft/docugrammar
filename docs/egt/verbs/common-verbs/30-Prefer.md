# Prefer

## Expressing preference

We use *prefer* to say we like one thing or activity more than another. We can use a prepositional phrase with *to* when we compare two things or actions:

- *I **prefer** tea **to** coffee.*
- *We **prefer** going by ferry **to** flying.*

We don’t use *than* after *prefer*:

- *She **prefers** books **to** magazines.*
- Not: *~~She prefers books than magazines.~~*

We can use a *to*\-infinitive or an *\-ing* form after *prefer*. A *to*\-infinitive is more common.

- *She’s not keen on coffee. She **prefers** to drink tea.* (or *She **prefers** drinking tea **to** coffee*.)

## Would prefer

We use *would prefer* or *’d prefer*, followed by a *to*\-infinitive or a noun, to talk about present and future preferences:

- *I**’d*** ***prefer** to go by myself.*
- ***Would you prefer*** *a quieter restaurant?*
- *She**’d*** ***prefer** not to drive at night.*

When we want to say that we would like to do one thing more than another, we can introduce the second thing with *rather than*, followed by an infinitive without *to*:

- ***I’d prefer*** *to go skiing this year **rather than** go on a beach holiday.*

When we are talking about our preferences for the actions of another person, we can use *would prefer* + object pronoun + *to*\-infinitive or *would prefer it if* + past simple:

- *They**’d prefer**us to come later.* (or *They**’d prefer it if** we came later*.)
- ***Would*** *you **prefer** me to drive?* (or ***Would*** *you **prefer it if** I drove?*)

## Typical errors

We use a *to*\-infinitive after *prefer*, not an infinitive without *to*:

- *I **prefer** to drive.*
- Not: *~~I prefer drive.~~*

- *Whenever I have time I like to read but I **prefer** not to read in the evening.*
- Not: … ~~but I prefer not read in the evening.~~

We make comparisons using *to* or *rather than*, not just *than*:

- *A lot of young people **prefer** computer games **to** football.* (or *A lot of young people prefer computer games **rather than** football*.)
- Not: *~~A lot of young people prefer computer games than football.~~*
