# Suggest

We can use the verb *suggest* with a noun phrase, a *that*\-clause, the -*ing* form of a verb or a *wh*\-question word (*where*, *what*).

## Suggest \+ noun phrase

We can use a noun phrase as the object of *suggest*:

- *Can you **suggest** a good restaurant in this part of town?*

If we need to mention the person who receives the suggestion, we use a *to-*construction:

- *My teacher **suggested** an exam I could take at the end of the year.* (or *My teacher **suggested** an exam **to me** which I could take at the end of the year*.)
- Not: *~~My teacher suggested me an exam~~* …

## Suggest \+ that\-clause

When we suggest an action to someone, we can use a *that*\-clause. In informal situations, *that* is often left out:

- *I **suggest** (**that**) you leave here around four o’clock. The traffic gets very bad from about 4.30 onwards.*

When *suggest* is in the past, we can use *should* in the *that*\-clause:

- *Her doctor **suggested*** ***that** she **should** reduce her working hours and take more exercise.*

## Suggest \+ -ing form

We can use *suggest* with the -*ing* form of a verb when we mention an action but do not mention the person who will do it, because it is understood in the context:

- *She **suggested** travell**ing** together for safety, since the area was so dangerous.*

## Suggest \+ wh-question word

We can use *suggest* with a question word such as *where, what, who, how*:

- *Could you **suggest where** I might be able to buy a nice sweater for Mark?*
- *Can anyone **suggest how** we might attract more people to the next event?*

## Typical errors

We don’t use *suggest* + indirect object + *to*\-infinitive when we suggest an action to someone:

- *He **suggested*** ***that** I should apply for a job in a bank or insurance company.*
- Not: *~~He suggested me to apply~~* …

We don’t use *suggest* + *to*\-infinitive:

- *Henry wanted to tell everyone, but Dora **suggested** wait**ing** until the news had been announced officially.*
- Not: *~~Dora suggested to wait~~* …
