# Infinitives with and without to

## Form

The infinitive of a verb has two forms: the *to*\-infinitive and the infinitive without *to*. The *to*\-form consists of *to* plus the base form of the verb:

- *I want **to speak** to you.*
- *We came here **to work**, not **to play**.*

The form without *to* consists of the base form of the verb:

- *She made us **wait** for half an hour.*
- *John lets the dog **sleep** on the sofa.*

## To\-infinitive

We use the *to*\-infinitive after a number of common main verbs. These include:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>agree</i></td><td><i>demand</i></td><td><i>long</i></td><td><i>pretend</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>aim</i></td><td><i>fail</i></td><td><i>love</i></td><td><i>promise</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>arrange</i></td><td><i>forget</i></td><td><i>manage</i></td><td><i>propose</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>ask</i></td><td><i>hate</i></td><td><i>mean</i></td><td><i>refuse</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>begin</i></td><td><i>help</i></td><td><i>need</i></td><td><i>remember</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>choose</i></td><td><i>hope</i></td><td><i>offer</i></td><td><i>try</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>claim</i></td><td><i>intend</i></td><td><i>plan</i></td><td><i>want</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>continue</i></td><td><i>learn</i></td><td><i>prefer</i></td><td><i>wish</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>decide</i></td><td><i>like</i></td><td><i>prepare</i></td><td><br/></td></tr></tbody></table>

*We arranged **to see** the bank manager and applied for a loan.*

*Mrs Harding asked us **to call** in on our way home.*

*Did you remember **to post** the letter to your mother?*

*He just wants everyone **to be** happy.*

Some of these verbs are also often followed by *\-ing*.

:::

We can use the *to*\-infinitive in a clause with a verb that has no subject (a non-finite clause). The *to*\-infinitive focuses on the idea of an action or the results of an action, rather than the action in itself:

- ***To work*** *in a developing country had always been her ambition.*
- ***To get*** *there before lunch, you would have to take the seven o’clock train.*

## Infinitive without to

We use the infinitive without *to* after modal verbs *can*, *could*, *may*, *might*, *will*, *shall*, *would*, *should*, *must*:

- *She can **sleep** in the guest room tonight.*
- *Will you **need** to rent a car during your stay?*

We also use the infinitive without *to* after *let*, *make* and (optionally) *help*:

- *He lets us **use** some of his land to grow vegetables.*
- *You can’t make a cat **do** anything it doesn’t want to do.*
- *I just want to help you **(to) understand** the situation better.*

## Typical errors

We don’t use the *to*\-infinitive after modal verbs:

- *We might buy a new sofa.*
- Not: *~~We might to buy a new sofa.~~*

We don’t use the infinitive (with or without *to*) after prepositions:

- *Lemon juice is useful **for cleaning** stained surfaces in the kitchen.*
- Not: … ~~is useful for clean~~ … or … ~~for to clean~~ …
