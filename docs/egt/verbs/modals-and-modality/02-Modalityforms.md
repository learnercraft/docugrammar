# Modality: forms

## Modal verbs

Core modal verbs have only one form. They have no *to*\-infinitive form, -*ing* form, past form or -*ed* form. We have to reword what we want to say by using other expressions:

- *I’d love to be able to see the Taj Mahal one day.*
- Not: *~~I’d love to can see the Taj Mahal one day.~~*

- *They had to sell their house.*
- Not: *~~They musted sell their house.~~*

### Affirmative (+) forms

Modal verbs are placed first in the verb phrase (after the subject) and are followed by a verb in the base form. The next verb may be a main verb or an auxiliary verb (*be*, *have*):

Modal verbs do not change form for tense or person. Modal verbs can be followed by the substitute verb *do*:

- A: *We thought he **might** sell the house*
- B: *Yes, he* ***could do***.

Modal verbs cannot be used with another modal verb:

- *Windsurfing **can** be difficult.*
- Not: *~~Windsurfing can might be difficult.~~ or ~~Windsurfing might can be difficult.~~*

Modal verbs always go before other verbs in a verb phrase:

- \[in a restaurant after a meal\]
- *I think the bill **could** be expensive.*
- Not: *~~I think the bill could expensive.~~*

- *You **can** go swimming, go for a long walk or visit the exhibition.*
- Not: *~~You can swimming, go for a long walk or visit the exhibition.~~*

Modal verbs can only be used alone when the main verb is clearly understood:

- A: *She **could** take the bus*.
- B: *Yeah, that’s true. She* ***could***. (She could take the bus.)
- A: *He may be wrong, you know*.
- B: *Yes, he* ***may***. (Yes, he may be wrong.)

### Negative (−) forms

:::warning

Negatives are formed by adding ‘not’ after the modal verbs. We don’t use *don’t*/*doesn’t/didn’t* with modal verbs:

- *We* ***can’t hear very well at the back.***
- Not: *~~We don’t can hear very well~~* …

:::

### Question (?) forms

:::warning

The subject and the modal verb change position to form questions. We don’t use *do/does/did*:

- ***Could*** *you help me?*
- Not: *~~Do you could help me?~~*

- ***Will*** *it be a problem?*
- Not: *~~Does it will be a problem?~~*

- *Why **can’t** you come too?*
- Not: *~~Why don’t you can come too?~~*

:::

We use modal verbs in question tags:

- *You **can’t** live like that, **can** you?*
- *It **could** be any of those things, **couldn’t** it?*

### Contracted forms

In speaking *shall* and *will* are often contracted to ’*ll* and *would* is contracted to ’*d*, especially when they follow a pronoun:

- *I’**ll** see you later.*
- *We**’ll** never get there.*
- *I knew they**’d** love it.*

The negative forms of modal verbs are often contracted.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>modal verb</td><td>uncontracted negative</td><td>contracted negative</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>can</i></td><td><i>cannot</i> (usually written as one word not two)</td><td><i>can’t</i> /kɑnt/</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>could</i></td><td><i>could not</i></td><td><i>couldn’t</i> /ˈkʊdənt/</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>may</i></td><td><i>may not</i></td><td><br/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>might</i></td><td><i>might not</i></td><td><i>mightn’t</i> /ˈmaɪtənt/</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>will</i></td><td><i>will not</i></td><td><i>*won’t</i> /wəʊnt/ or <i>’ll not</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>shall</i></td><td><i>shall not</i></td><td><i>*shan’t</i> /ʃɑnt/ or <i>’ll not</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>would</i></td><td><i>would not</i></td><td><i>*wouldn’t</i> /ˈwʊdənt/ or <i>’d not</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>should</i></td><td><i>should not</i></td><td><i>shouldn’t</i> /ˈʃʊdənt/</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>must</i></td><td><i>must not</i></td><td><i>mustn’t</i> /ˈmʌsənt/</td></tr></tbody></table>

\* is the more common of the two forms.

### Modal verbs and adverbs

We usually put adverbs in mid position between the modal verb and the main verb:

- *Loud noises may **sometimes** frighten dogs and other animals.*
- *You’ll **probably** notice something different about the house.*

When the main verb is understood, we can put the adverb between the subject and the modal verb:

- A: *I can **never** remember Flo’s number*.
- B: *I **never** can either*. (I can never remember Flo’s number either.)

## Dare, need, ought to and used to (semi-modal verbs)

*Dare, need, ought to* and *used to* are often called semi-modal because in some ways they are formed like modal verbs and in some ways they are like other main verbs.

Like modal verbs, *ought to* and *used to* do not change form for person. *Needn’t* and *daren’t* do not have a third person *\-s* in the present:

- *It **used to** be so easy. It **ought to** be easy now.*
- *She **needn’t** worry.*
- *John **daren’t** tell Ruth about the accident.*

Like main verbs, the negative form of *need*, *dare* and *used to* is made by using *do*. But it can also be made without using *do* (like modal verbs).

The negative form of *ought to* is not made with *do*:

- *We **oughtn’t to** spend so much money.*
- Not: *~~We don’t ought to spend so much money.~~*

Like main verbs, the question form for *need, dare* and *used to* is made by using *do*:

- ***Does*** *she **need** to get a camera before she goes away?*
- ***Did*** *you **use to** play football when you were a child?*

Question and negative forms of *ought to* are rare.
