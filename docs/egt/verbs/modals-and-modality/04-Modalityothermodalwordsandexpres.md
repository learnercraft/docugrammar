# Modality: other modal words and expressions

## Other modal words

Apart from modal verbs, there are a lot of words which also express modality. They are words which express degrees of certainty or obligation.

### Expressing degrees of certainty

Adjectives: *possible*, *probable*, *certain*, *sure*, *likely, unlikely, definite*, *clear*, *obvious*

Adverbs: *possibly*, *probably*, *certainly*, *surely*, *definitely*, *clearly*, *obviously*

### Expressing degrees of obligation

Adjectives: *necessary*, *compulsory*, *obligatory*, *essential*

Adverbs: *necessarily*, *perhaps*, *maybe*

- \[on the phone\]
- *Is it **possible** to ring us back when my husband is home?* (or *Can/could you (possibly) ring us back when my husband is home?*)
- *I’m thinking of **possibly** buying a house now.* (I might buy a house.)
- \[talking about a computer\]
- A: *It’s a good machine*.
- B: *Yeah. It **certainly** is*. (I agree completely.)

*Necessarily* is often used with *not*.

- *Erm I met Gary in Wales when I was at university there and we ideally wanted to stay in Wales. **Not necessarily** in South Wales.* (not obligatory – it can be South Wales or in another part of Wales)

## Other modal expressions

Spoken English:

These expressions are also very common in informal speaking: *for certain, for sure, for definite*:

- *It’s nice to get something for free, that’s **for sure**.*
- A: *When’s the wedding going to be? April?*
- B: *April the seventeenth* ***for definite***.

We often use *for certain for sure/for definite* with *know*:

- *We think Graham is coming. We don’t know **for certain**.* (or *for sure/for definite*)

### Certainly and surely

:::warning

*Certainly* and *surely* do not have the same meaning. We use *certainly* when we have no doubt about something. We use *surely* when we want agreement:

- *The car is **certainly** more comfortable than the bike.* (I have no doubt about it.)
- *The car is **surely** more comfortable than the bike.* (I’m not certain but this seems likely.)

- A: *When I go to town now in Cardiff, I don’t know anybody*.
- B: *But, Richard*, ***surely*** *you’ve still got lots of friends here*. (The speaker is asking for agreement with something that seems likely.)
