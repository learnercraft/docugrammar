# Modality: tense

## Modal verbs in past, present and future time

Modal verbs do not change in form to make different tenses. All of the modal verbs can refer to present and future time. Only some of them can refer to past time.

- \[ready-made pastry is pastry you can buy which is ready to use\]
- *When I was in school, you **could** get a type of ready-made pastry. I think you **can** still get it now.* (*could* refers to past time; *can* refers to present time)
- *Students on a computer course at the polytechnic **will** get their own laptops next year.* (*will* refers to future time)

## Past and present relations

The modal verbs that only refer to past time are sometimes seen as past forms of the other core modal verbs.

## Politeness

We often use the past forms to be more polite or formal, or less direct.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>Can</i></b><i> you just have a quick look at the pasta?</i></td><td><b><i>Could</i></b><i> you just have a quick look at the pasta?</i></td><td><i>Could</i> is a little less direct.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>Will</i></b><i> you find me another pen?</i></td><td><b><i>Would</i></b><i> you find me another pen?</i></td><td><i>Would</i> is more polite.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>You </i><b><i>may</i></b><i> want to change the formatting.</i></td><td><i>You </i><b><i>might</i></b><i> want to change the formatting.</i></td><td><i>Might</i> is a little more formal and distant.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Past and continuous

We can indicate the past by using a modal verb + *have + -ed* form of the verb which follows:

- *We **should have listened** more carefully.*
- *The fire **could have been** worse. It **could have** spread upstairs.*
- *I suppose we **could have gone** to the hotel. I **would have preferred** the holiday camp.*

We can indicate the continuous by using a modal verb + *be + -ing* form of the verb which follows.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>continuous</td><td><i>They </i><b><i>may be coming</i></b><i> sooner than we expected.</i><i>He </i><b><i>could be staying</i></b><i> with friends in London.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>past and continuous</td><td><i>She </i><b><i>might have been waiting</i></b><i> for us.</i><i>I </i><b><i>must have been chatting</i></b><i> to him for 20 minutes.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>
