# Can

## Can: forms

### Affirmative (+) form

*Can* comes first in the verb phrase (after the subject and before another verb):

- *We \[verb phrase\] **can** take the train to Birmingham.*

*Can* is never used with another modal verb:

- *He **can** hear the music from his room sometimes.*
- Not: *~~He can might hear the music~~ … or ~~He might can might hear the music~~* …

### Negative (−) form

The negative form of *can* is *can’t*. We don’t use *don’t*/*doesn’t*/*didn’t* with *can*:

- *I **can’t** believe you said that!*
- Not: *~~I don’t can believe you said that!~~*

We can use the full form *cannot* (one word) in formal contexts or when we want to emphasise something:

- *I **cannot** understand why she behaves like that.*

### Question (?) form

:::warning

The subject and *can* change position to form questions. We don’t use *do*/*does*/*did*:

- ***Can this*** *really be true?*
- Not: *~~Does this can really be true?~~*
- ***Can’t you*** *ask for another day off work?*

:::

We use *can* and *can’t* in question tags:

- *You can’t take photos inside the museum, **can you**?*
- *Abby can speak Japanese, **can’t she**?*

## Can: uses

### Permission

We often use *can* to ask for or give permission:

- ***Can*** *I take Daisy for a walk?*
- *Students **can** use calculators during the exam.*

We use *can’t* to forbid (say what you must not do):

- *You **can’t** park there.*
- *You **can’t** just take the day off work. You have to have permission in advance.*

:::note[See also]

- *May*

:::

### Ability

We often use *can* to talk about ability to do something in the present or future:

- *I **can** sing one song in Polish.*
- ***Can*** *you sleep on your back?*
- *We **can** go swimming after school tomorrow, if you like.*

We often use *can* with verbs of perception such as *hear, see, smell, taste*, and mental process verbs such as *guess, imagine, picture, understand* and *follow* (in the sense of ‘understand’):

- *I **can** hear you.*
- *I **can** see her coming down the road now.*
- ***Can*** *you smell something burning?*
- *I **can** guess why you’re angry.*
- *We **can’t** follow these instructions for installing this new DVD player.* (We can’t understand these instructions.)

### General truths

We use *can* to talk about things which we think are usually, but not always, true:

- *Reducing cholesterol through diet **can** be difficult.* (It’s not always difficult for everyone, but in general it is difficult.)
- *Fireworks **can** frighten pets.*
- *Swans **can** be very vicious.*

We don’t normally use *could* to talk about what we believe to be true in the present.

- *Could*

### Possibility

We use *can* to express possibility or to question possibilities:

- *We **can** go to Rome in June because both of us have a week off work.* (It is possible for us to go to Rome because we don’t have to work in June.)
- *Well, how **can** you be on a diet if you buy so much chocolate?* (I don’t think it’s possible that you are on a diet because you still buy lots of chocolate.)

### Guessing and predicting: can’t as the negative of must

When we want to guess or predict something, we use c*an’t* as the negative form of *must*. We use *can’t have +* -*ed* form as the negative form of *must have +* -*ed. Can’t* and *can’t have +* -*ed* form express strong possibility:

- A: *Who owns this blue coat? It **must** be yours*.
- B: *It **can’t** be mine. It’s too big*. (A uses *must* to guess that the coat belongs to B. He sees this as a strong possibility. B uses *can’t* to express strong negative possibility. The coat is too big, so it isn’t his.)
- A: *Roy **must** have made a lot of money*.
- B: *He **can’t** have done. He doesn’t even own a house*. (A makes a deduction that Roy has made a lot of money. B sees this as very unlikely and so expresses it as a negative possibility.)

### Reproaches

We use *can’t* as a question form to ask people to stop doing something we don’t want them to do, or to do something they are not doing which we want them to do:

- *Why **can’t** you just be nice to her instead of upsetting her?*

The past of *can* is *could*:

- *In those days, you **could** buy everything in the local shop. Now we have to go to the big supermarket for everything.*

When we question the possibility of something in the past, we use *can’t have* +-*ed* form:

## Can: typical errors

We write *cannot* as one word:

We use *could*, not *can*, to talk about ability in the past.

- Not: *~~They can see a light on in the house~~* …
