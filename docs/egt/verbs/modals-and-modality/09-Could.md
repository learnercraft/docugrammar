# Could

## Could: form

### Affirmative (+) form

*Could* comes first in the verb phrase (after the subject and before another verb):

- *We **could** have lunch early.*

*Could* cannot be used with another modal verb:

- *We **could** drive to France*
- Not: *~~We could might drive to France~~. or ~~We might could drive to France.~~*

### Negative (−) form

The negative form of *could* is *couldn’t*. We don’t use *don’t*/*doesn’t*/*didn’t* with *could*:

- *He **couldn’t** lift that. It’s too heavy.*
- Not: *~~He didn’t could lift that~~* …

We can use the full form *could not* in formal contexts or when we want to emphasise something:

- *Fabio was frightened. He **could not** move his arm. It was stuck.*

### Question (?) form

The subject and *could* change position to form questions. We don’t use *do/does/did*:

- ***Could*** *I pay by credit card?*
- Not: *~~Do I could pay by credit card?~~*

We use *could* and *couldn’t* in question tags:

- *I could come back tomorrow, **couldn’t** I?*

## Could: uses

### Possibility

We often use *could* to express possibility in the present and the future.

### Suggestions

We often use *could* to make suggestions:

- B: *Again? How many times have you done that?*
- A: *I’ve got to be in the meeting at 10 and the train doesn’t get in until 10.15*.
- B: ***Could*** *you get an earlier train?*

### Permission

We use *could* to ask for permission. *Could* is more formal and polite than *can*:

- ***Could*** *I ask you a personal question?*

:::warning

We don’t use *could* to give or refuse permission. We use *can*:

- A: ***Could*** *I leave early today?*
- B: *Yes, you can./No, you can’t*.
- Not: *~~Yes, you could./No, you couldn’t.~~*

## Could: past

We don’t usually use *could* to talk about single events that happened in the past.

### Past achievement

When actual past achievements are mentioned, we usually use *was/were able to* or *managed to* but not *could* in affirmative clauses. This is because they are facts, rather than possibilities:

- *I **was able to/managed to** buy a wonderful bag to match my shoes.*
- Not: *~~I could buy a wonderful bag to match my shoes.~~*
- *We hired a car and we **were able to/managed to** drive 1,000 miles in one week.*
- Not: *~~We hired a car and we could drive 1,000 miles in one week.~~*

### Ability

We use *could* to talk about past ability:

- *When I was young, I **could** easily touch my toes.*

### Possibility

We use *could have + -ed* form to talk about possibility in the past:

- *I **could have been** a lawyer.*
- *They **could have taken** a taxi home instead of walking and getting wet.*
- *Janette **couldn’t have done** any better.*

### Guessing and predicting: couldn’t as the negative of must

When we want to guess or predict something, we use *couldn’t* as the negative form of *must*. We use *couldn’t have +* -*ed* form as the negative form of *must have +* -*ed. Couldn’t* and *couldn’t have +* -*ed* form express strong possibility:

- *She must have made a mistake. It **couldn’t be true**.*
- *A firework **couldn’t have done** all that damage.*

### Could \+ smell, taste, think, believe, etc

We use *could* to refer to single events that happened in the past, with verbs of the senses (*smell*, *taste*, *see*, *hear*, *touch*, etc.) and mental processes (*think*, *believe*, *remember*, *understand* etc.):

- *The food was terrible. I **could taste** nothing but salt.*
- *We knew they were in there. We **could hear** voices inside.*
- *He came and spoke to me, but I **couldn’t remember** his name.*

### Reporting can

We use *could* when reporting clauses with *can* as past events:

- *They told us we **could** wait in the hallway.* (The original words were probably: ‘You can wait in the hallway.’)
- *She said we **could** book the tickets online.* (The speaker remembers hearing ‘You can book the tickets online.’)

### Criticism

We often use *could have* + -*ed* form to express disapproval or criticism:

- *You **could have** called to say you would be late.* (You didn’t call – I think you should have called.)
- *You **could have** tidied your room.*

### Regret

We use *could have* + -*ed* form to talk about things that did not happen and sometimes to expresses regret:

- *He **could have been** a doctor.*
- *I **could have been** famous.*

We often use the expression *how could you/she/he/they?* to show disapproval (to show that we don’t like what someone has done):

- *Grandfather, **how could you**? **How could you** leave me?*
- ***How could you*** *have gone without telling me?*
- A: *We had to give away our dog when we moved to England*.
- B: *Oh*, ***how could you****?*
