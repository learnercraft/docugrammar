# Could, may and might

We use *could, may* and *might* to express degrees of possibility. Many native speakers disagree on which one expresses more or less certainty.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>The restaurant </i><b><i>may</i></b><i> close.</i></td><td>It is likely that the restaurant will close.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>The restaurant </i><b><i>could</i></b><i> close.</i></td><td>It is less likely that the restaurant will close.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>The restaurant </i><b><i>might</i></b><i> close.</i></td><td>There is only a possibility that the restaurant will close but no one is very sure.</td></tr></tbody></table>

The speaker also shows degree of certainty or uncertainty through intonation and stress. If the speaker stresses the modal verb, they are expressing more uncertainty than if they stress the main verb.
