# Dare

*Dare* is both a main verb and a semi-modal verb.

*Dare* can mean ‘challenge somebody’. With this meaning, it is a main verb and requires an object. Any verb that follows it is in the *to*\-infinitive:

- *Go on, I **dare** you.*
- *Some snakes can bite but I **dare** you to hold this big snake.*

*Dare* also means ‘to be brave enough or rude enough to do something’. With this meaning, it can be used as an ordinary main verb which can be followed by a *to*\-infinitive or an infinitive without *to*. Less commonly, it can be used as a semi-modal verb followed by an infinitive without *to*.

### Affirmative statement

*If Sally **dares (to)** go there again, she’ll be in big trouble!* (ordinary verb)

### Negative statement

*He doesn’t **dare (to)** go there.* (ordinary verb)

*No one **dares (to)** go there.* (ordinary verb)

*No one **dare** go there.* (semi-modal verb)

### Affirmative question

*Does anyone **dare (to)** go there?* (ordinary verb)

***Dare*** *anyone go there?* (semi-modal verb)

### Negative question

*Doesn’t he **dare (to)** go there?* (ordinary verb)

***Daren’t*** *he go there?* (semi-modal verb)

## Typical error

We don’t use infinitive with *to* after semi-modal *dare* in the expression *How dare you:*

- *How **dare** you suggest she was lazy!*
- Not: *~~How dare you to suggest~~*…
