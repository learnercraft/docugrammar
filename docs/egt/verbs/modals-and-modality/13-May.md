## May: forms

### Affirmative (+) form

*May* comes first in the verb phrase (after the subject and before another verb):

- *It **may** be possible for him to get home tonight.*

*May* can’t be used with another modal verb:

- *This **may** hurt you.*
- Not: *~~This may could hurt you~~. or ~~This could may hurt you.~~*

### Negative (−) form

The negative form of *may* is *may not*. We don’t use *don’t*/*doesn’t/didn’t* with *may*:

- *We **may not** have enough information at the moment.*
- Not: *~~We don’t may have enough information at the moment.~~*

:::warning

We don’t use *mayn’t* as the contracted form of *may not*:

- *We **may not** yet know what is safe to eat.*
- Not: *~~We mayn’t yet know what is safe to eat.~~*

- ***May*** *I leave the room, please?*
- Not: *~~Do I may leave the room please?~~*

## May: uses

### Permission

We use *may* to ask for, give and refuse permission. It is quite formal.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>asking for permission</td><td>giving permission</td><td>refusing permission</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>May</i></b><i> I leave the room?</i></td><td><i>Yes, you </i><b><i>may</i></b><i>.</i></td><td><i>No, you </i><b><i>may</i></b><i> not.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>May</i></b><i> we use your phone?</i></td><td><i>Yes, you </i><b><i>may</i></b><i>.</i></td><td><i>No, you </i><b><i>may</i></b><i> not.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

*Can, could* and *may* are all used to ask for permission. *May* is the most formal/polite and *could* is more formal and polite than *can*.

- Requests

### Possibility

We use *may* to refer to weak possibility in the present and future:

- *The economy **may** go up or down in the next year.* (I think both are possible, the economy going up or the economy going down. I am not making either one a strong possibility.)
- *I think I **may** go to the doctor today and try to get some antibiotics.* (I am not very sure yet if I will go to the doctor.)

### General truths

We use *may* in formal writing, especially academic English, to describe things which the speaker thinks are generally true or possible. In this case, it is a more formal equivalent of *can*.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>A typical farmer’s cottage </i><b><i>can</i></b><i> be seen in the Ulster Folk Museum.</i></td><td>Both sentences express what the speaker believes to be a general truth about where the cottage is located. The speaker knows that there is a cottage in the museum and a visitor is able to see them there if they want to. <i>May</i> is more formal.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>A typical farmer’s cottage </i><b><i>may</i></b><i> be seen in the Ulster Folk Museum.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>
