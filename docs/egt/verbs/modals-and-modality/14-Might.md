# Might

## Might: forms

### Affirmative (+) form

*Might* comes first in the verb phrase (after the subject and before another verb):

- *She **might** sell her house.*
- *This **might** be true.*
- Not: *~~That might can be true~~. or ~~That can might be true.~~*

### Negative (−) form

The negative form of *might* is *might not* or *mightn’t*. We don’t use *don’t*/*doesn’t/didn’t* with *might*:

- *There **might not** be anyone in the house.* (or *There **mightn’t** be* …)
- Not: *~~There doesn’t might be anyone in the house.~~*

### Question (?) form

The subject and *might* change position to form questions.

:::warning

We don’t use *do/does/did*:

- ***Might*** *this be the key?*
- Not: *~~Does this might be the key?~~*
- ***Mightn’t*** *this be the key?*
- Not: *~~Doesn’t might this be the key?~~*

:::

We can use *might* and *mightn’t* in question tags, but they’re not very common:

- *That might not be a bad idea, **might it**?*
- *That plant might do better by the window,* ***mightn’t it?***

## Might: uses

### Possibility

We use *might* most often to refer to weak possibility:

- *I **might** go to Japan for a month to study Japanese.*
- *The dog **might** bark when we pass by the gate.*
- *They **might** not like very hot food.*

### Permission

We use *might* to refer to permission. It is very formal and is not used very often:

- ***Might*** *I ask your name?*
- ***Might*** *I interrupt you for a moment?*

:::warning

The reply to these will not contain *might*:

- A: ***Might*** *I ask your address?*
- B: *Yes. It’s 41 Ross Avenue*.

- A: ***Might*** *I ask you a question?*
- B: *Yes. Of course*.
- Not: *~~Yes. You might.~~*

### Suggestions

We can use *might* to give advice or make a suggestion sound more polite or less direct, especially when used together with *like, prefer* or *want*:

- \[A waiter politely suggesting a dessert to a customer.\]
- *You **might** like to try one of our wonderful desserts.*
