# Ought to

*Ought to* is a semi-modal verb because it is in some ways like a modal verb and in some ways like a main verb. For example, unlike modal verbs, it is followed by *to*, but like modal verbs, it does not change form for person:

- *I **ought to** phone my parents.*
- *It **ought to** be easy now.*

## Ought to: form

### Affirmative

*Ought to* comes first in the verb phrase (after the subject and before another verb):

- *We **ought to** do more exercise.*

*Ought to* cannot be used with another modal verb:

- *Medicine **ought to** be free.*
- Not: *~~Medicine ought to can be free~~. or ~~Medicine can ought to be free~~*.

### Negative

The negative is formed by adding ‘not’ after *ought (ought not to*). It can be contracted to *oughtn’t to*. We don’t use *don’t*, *doesn’t, didn’t* with *ought to*:

- *We **ought not to** have ordered so much food.*
- Not: *~~We don’t ought to have ordered so much food.~~*

- *You **oughtn’t to** have said that about his mother.*
- Not: *~~You didn’t ought to have said that about his mother.~~*

The negative of *ought to* is not common. We usually use *shouldn’t* or *should not* instead:

- *You **shouldn’t** speak to your father like that.* (preferred to *You oughtn’t to speak* …)

### Questions

The subject and *ought to* change position to form questions. We don’t use *do, does, did*:

- ***Ought*** *she **to** call the police?*
- Not: *~~Does she ought to call the police?~~*
- ***Ought*** *we **to** be more worried about the environment?*
- Not: *~~Do we ought to be more worried about the environment?~~*

:::warning

The question form of *ought to* is not very common. It is very formal. We usually use *should* instead.

## Ought to: uses

### What is desired or ideal

We use *ought to* when talking about things which are desired or ideal:

- *They **ought to** have more parks in the city centre.*
- *We **ought to** eat lots of fruit and vegetables every day.*

We use *ought to have* + -*ed* form to talk about things that were desired or ideal in the past but which didn’t happen. It can express regret:

- *We **ought to have*** ***locked** the gate. Then the dog wouldn’t have got out.* (The ideal or desired thing was that we locked the gate, but we didn’t.)
- *I often think that I **ought to have studied** medicine not pharmacy.* (I would be happier now if I had studied medicine.)

### What is likely

We can use *ought to* when we talk about what is likely or probable:

- *The concert **ought to** only take about two hours so we’ll be home by 12 pm.*
- *There **ought to** be some good films at the cinema this weekend.*

## Ought to or should?

*Ought to* and *should* are similar in meaning. *Should* is more common than *ought to*. *Ought to* is more formal than *should*:

- *There **ought to** be more street lights here.* (means the same as *There **should** be more street lights here*.)
- *I really **ought to walk my dog more. He’s so fat.*** (means the same as *I really* ***should** walk my dog more. He’s so fat*.)

Spoken English:

In speaking, we normally use *should* as a tag for clauses with *ought to*:

- *There **ought to** be a speed limit here, **shouldn’t** there?* (preferred to *There ought to be a speed limit here, oughtn’t there?*)
- *We **ought*** ***not to** have to pay for basic medicines, **should** we?* (preferred to *We* *ought not to have to pay for basic medicines, ought we?*)
