# Shall

## Shall: forms

### Affirmative form

*Shall* comes first in the verb phrase (after the subject and before another verb). We use it mostly with *I* and *we*:

- *I shall **post** it to you tomorrow.*

*Shall* cannot be used with another modal verb:

- *I **shall** have to be at the airport by 5 pm.*
- Not: *~~I shall must be~~ … or ~~I must shall be~~* …

*Shall* can be followed by *have to, need to* and *be able to*:

- *We **shall have to** tell him what happened.*
- *The good news is I **shall be able to** join you at your meeting next week.*

### Negative form

The negative form of *shall* is *shan’t*. We don’t use *don’t*, *doesn’t, didn’t* with *shall*:

- *I **shan’t** be home tomorrow night.*
- *We **shan’t** know the result of the tests till Tuesday.*

We can use the full form *shall not* in formal contexts or when we want to emphasis something:

- \[a public notice in a restaurant\]
- *The management **shall not** be responsible for damage to personal property.*

We don’t often use the negative form.

### Question form

The subject and *shall* change position to form questions.

:::warning

We don’t use *do, does, did*. The question form, with *I* and *we*, is the most common use of *shall*:

- ***Shall*** *I come round to the office?*
- Not: *~~Do I shall come round to the office?~~*

We use *shall* in question tags:

- *I’ll phone you later,* ***shall I?***

## Shall: uses

### Offers, suggestions and advice

We use *shall* *I* and *shall we* to make offers and suggestions, and to ask for advice.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>offer</td><td><b><i>Shall I</i></b><i> carry your bag?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>suggestion</td><td><b><i>Shall I</i></b><i> call again on Thursday?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>seeking advice</td><td><i>What </i><b><i>shall</i></b><i> </i><b><i>we</i></b><i> do with this?</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Predictions and intentions

We use *shall* instead of *will* with *I* and *we* in rather formal contexts to make predictions and to talk about intentions or decisions. It is much less common than *will*.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>formal</td><td>less formal</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>We </i><b><i>shall</i></b><i> remember this day forever.</i></td><td><i>We </i><b><i>will</i></b><i> remember this day forever.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

:::warning

We use *shall* only with the first person pronouns *I* and *we* to make predictions or express intentions:

- *The new business cards **will** be ready at the end of the month.*
- Not: *~~The new business cards shall be ready at the end of the month.~~*

:::

### Commands

:::warning

In very formal contexts, we use *shall* to give commands:

- \[public notice\]
- *This door **shall** be kept closed at all times.*
