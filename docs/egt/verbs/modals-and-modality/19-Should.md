# Should

## Should: forms

### Affirmative form

*Should* comes first in the verb phrase (after the subject and before another verb):

- *I **should go** home now.*

*Should* cannot be used with another modal verb:

- *It **should** probably be sunny at that time of year.*
- Not: *~~It should may be sunny~~ … or ~~It may should be sunny~~* …

### Negative form

The negative form of *should* is *shouldn’t*. We don’t use *don’t*, *doesn’t, didn’t* with *should*:

- *There **shouldn’t** be many people at the beach today.*

We use the full form *should not* in formal contexts or when we want to emphasis something:

- *We **should not** forget those who have given their lives in the defence of freedom.*

### Question form

The subject and *should* change position to form questions.

:::warning

We don’t use *do, does, did*:

- ***Should*** *I turn on the air conditioning?*
- Not: *~~Do I should I turn on the air conditioning?~~*
- ***Shouldn’t*** *you be studying now?*

:::

We use *should* and *shouldn’t* in question tags:

- *I shouldn’t have told her that, **should I**?*
- *They should be getting back on Sunday, **shouldn’t they**?*

## Should: uses

### What is ideal or desired

We use *should* most commonly to talk about what is the ideal or best thing to do in a situation:

- *There **should** be more public hospitals.*
- *They **should** reduce the price of petrol. It’s so expensive.*
- *There **should** be four more candles on the cake.*

We use *should have* + *\-ed* form to talk about things that were ideal in the past but which didn’t happen. It can express regret:

- *Everyone knows that this is a busy restaurant. They **should have made** a reservation.*
- *I **should have studied** harder when I was young. I wish I had gone to college.*

### Advice and suggestions

We often use *should* to give advice and make suggestions:

- *You **should** tell him what you think.*
- *We **should** leave it until tomorrow; it’s late now.*

- *Suggest*
- Suggestions

### What is likely to happen

We also use *should* to talk about what is likely to happen:

- *Shall we start? Luke’s delayed but he says he **should** be here in ten minutes.*
- *There **should** be a very big crowd at the party. Mary has so many friends.*

### Conditional sentences

:::warning

We sometimes use *should* in hypothetical conditional clauses with *if* to express possibility. It is formal:

- \[information leaflet in a hotel room\]
- *If you **should** wish to use the Internet, there is a code available at the reception desk.*
- *If you **should** decide not to go on the trip, you will get a full refund.*

- *If*
- Conditionals
- *If* + *should*

:::

:::warning

We can also use *Should you* as an alternative to *If you should* in these situations by changing the order of the subject and the verb. Compare these two sentences with the examples above. They have the same meaning and they are also formal:

- ***Should you*** *wish to use the Internet, there is a code available at the reception desk.*
- ***Should you*** *decide not to go on the trip, you will get a full refund.*

### Thanking

Spoken English:

In speaking, we often say *you shouldn’t have* when someone gives us a gift:

- A: *I got you something from Texas. A cowboy hat*.
- B: *Oh Ken, you **shouldn’t have**!*

### Surprise or regret

We sometimes use *should* to express surprise or regret about something that happened:

- *I’m amazed that he **should** have done something so stupid.*
- *I’m sorry that he **should** be so upset by what I said.*

## Should and would

We use *should* as a more formal alternative to *would* with *I* and *we* in conditional clauses.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>formal</td><td>neutral</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I/We </i><b><i>should</i></b><i> love to meet her again if I/we had a chance.</i></td><td><i>I/We </i><b><i>would</i></b><i> love to meet her again if I/we had a chance.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

We use *should* as a more formal alternative to *would* when we want to be less direct.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>formal</td><td>neutral</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I </i><b><i>should</i></b><i> think that a lot of people will be interested.</i></td><td><i>I </i><b><i>would</i></b><i> think that a lot of people will be interested.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Should and ought to

*Should* and *ought to* have similar meanings and uses. *Ought to* is more formal and less common than *should*:

- *We **should** clean up the garden.*
- *We **ought*** ***to** clean up the garden.*

*Should* is much more common in negatives and questions than *ought to*:

- ***Should*** *we keep a seat for Margaret?* (more common than *Ought we to keep a seat …?*)
- *He **shouldn’t** speak to his parents in that way.* (more common than *He oughtn’t/ought not to speak …*)
