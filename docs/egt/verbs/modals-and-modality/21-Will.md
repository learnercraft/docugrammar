# Will

## Will: form

### Affirmative form

*Will* comes first in the verb phrase in a statement (after the subject and before another verb). It is often contracted to *’ll* in informal situations:

- *The next Olympic Games **will** be in London.*
- *I**’ll** give you a call at about 6 o’clock.*

*Will* cannot be used with another modal verb:

- *You **will** be obliged to sign a contract before starting employment.*
- Not: *~~You will must sign a contract~~ … or ~~You must will sign a contract~~* …

*Will* can be followed by *have to* or *be able to*:

- *You**’ll have*** ***to** let me know when it arrives.*
- *She **will*** ***be able to** live nearer her parents if she gets the job.*

- *Must* and *have* (*got*) *to*?

:::

### Negative form

The negative form of *will* is *won’t*. We don’t use *don’t*, *doesn’t, didn’t* with *will*:

- *They **won’t** tell us very much until January.*
- Not: *~~They don’t will tell us very much until January.~~*

We use the full form *will not* in formal contexts or when we want to emphasise something:

- *I’ll carry her but I **will not** push a pram.*

### Question form

The subject and *will* change position to form questions. We don’t use *do, does, did*:

- ***Will*** *you be home earlier tomorrow?*
- ***Will*** *I be able to take this brochure home with me?*
- ***Will*** *the number be in the phone book?*
- Not: *~~Does the number will be in the phone book?~~*

We can use *will* and *won’t* in question tags:

- *You won’t forget to take the cake out of the oven, **will** you?*
- *It’ll take quite a long time to get there, **won’t** it?*

### Will or ’ll?

We commonly use *’ll* as the short form of *will* and *shall*. In speaking, *will* and *shall* are usually contracted to *’ll*, especially after subject pronouns (*I*, *we*, *you*, *they*, *he*, *she*, *it*):

- *We**’ll** meet you outside the coffee shop.* (more common in speaking than *We will meet you …*)

However, in some contexts *’ll* is normally the only choice. In such cases, *’ll* is best not seen as a contraction of either *will* or *shall*, but as an independent form.

As an independent form, *’ll* is often used to indicate a personal decision:

- *There’s the cinema. We**’ll** get out here and you can park the car over there.*
- Not: *~~We shall/will get out~~* …
- A: *Anyone want a drink?*
- B: *I**’ll** have a tomato juice, please*.

*’ll* is also used for indicating decisions or arrangements where *will* or *shall* would sound too direct and too formal:

- *OK. My diary says I’m free on Wednesday. So we**’ll** meet next Wednesday.*
- *We**’ll**get the train to Paris and then the Metro to the hotel. Naoe and Dave and the boys**’ll** join us as soon as they’ve finished their meetings.*

:::warning

A noun phrase + *’ll* is not normally acceptable in writing:

- *Jan’s father **will** fetch you from the station.*
- Not: *~~Jan’s father’ll fetch you~~* …

*’ll* is not used in a tag or a short answer:

- \[talking about the offer of a cheap hotel room\]
- A: *But you’ll have to be quick. Everyone will be after it, won’t they?*
- B: *Yeah, they* ***will***.
- Not: *~~Yeah, they’ll.~~*

## Will: uses

### Certainty in the future

One of the main uses of *will* is to refer to things in the future that we think are certain:

- *The rooms **will** be redecorated but all the facilities **will** be the same.*
- A: *He’s still there at the moment*.
- B: *He**’ll** be there until the new guy starts*.
- \[talking to a child\]
- ***Will*** *you be 5 in September?*

### Making predictions

*Will* is used to make predictions about the future:

- A: *Have you decided what you are going to do with the car?*
- B: *No. Father thinks it**’ll** cost a lot of money to fix*.
- *I think they**’ll** be off in January again.* (they’ll be away, possibly on holiday)

Some predictions are about facts – things that we know always happen:

- *It’s all wool. It**’ll** shrink if you wash it in hot water.*

Some predictions are about the present:

- *That**’ll** be Katie shouting.* (The speaker is certain. He or she makes a deduction because of what they know about the situation.)

### Conditional sentences

We often use *will* (or the contracted form *’ll*) in the main clause of a conditional sentence when we talk about possible situations in the future:

- *If she gets the job, she **will** have to move to Germany.*
- *I**’ll** take a day off if the weather’s fine next week.*

### Intentions and decisions

We use *will* for immediate intentions and decisions. We usually use *’ll*, not *will*, after *I think*:

- *When I go and see Marie, I think I**’ll** take her some flowers.*
- *What **will** you do with that soup? **Will** you just put it in the fridge or will you freeze it?*
- *I think I**’ll** have some orange juice, actually.*

We use *will* and *be going to* for decisions, intentions and plans. We use *will* when the decision is immediate and *be going to* when we have already made a plan:

- A: *It’s too expensive to fly on the Friday. Look it’s nearly £200. It’s only £25 to fly on Thursday*.
- B: *We**’ll** fly on Thursday then*.
- A: *Great. That**’ll** save us lots of money*.
- *We**’re******going*** ***to** drive to Birmingham on Friday, and Saturday morning we**’re*** ***going*** ***to** drive to Edinburgh.*

### Willingness and offers

*Will* is often used to express someone’s willingness to do something or to make offers. It is often used with *I* in this context:

- ***I’ll*** *show you where to go.*
- A: *It’s just a leaflet that I’ve got*.
- B: *Just the leaflet. Right*, ***I’ll*** *go and get you a brochure too*.
- ***I’ll*** *give you a lift to the hotel.*

### Promises

We use *will* to make promises:

- *I**’ll** be there for you. Don’t worry.*
- *We**’ll** always love you.*

:::note[See also]

- *Promise*

:::

### Requests and invitations

We often make requests or invitations with *will*:

- ***Will*** *you pass me the salt?*
- *This tastes good. **Will** you give me the recipe?*
- ***Will*** *you come for dinner on Saturday?*

### Commands

We sometimes give commands or orders using *will*:

- ***Will*** *you be quiet, please!*
- ***Will*** *you stop picking your nails!*

It is also used to insist that someone does something:

- *But you **will** have to do it. You’ll have no choice.*
- \[parent to child\]
- *You **will** wear it whether you like it or not.*

### General truths

*Will* is used to describe something the speaker thinks is generally true:

- \[talking about making complaints at hospitals\]
- A: *Do you think they should try and make it easier for people to complain?*
- B: *No, cos some people **will** always complain*. (*cos* = *because* in informal speech)

### Habitual events

We use *will* to refer to events that happen often:

- \[talking about a younger sister, Celia, who doesn’t eat properly; *she* refers to Celia\]
- *Celia **will** start to get upset if she has to eat cabbage or meat like chicken breast. My mum **will** say, ‘Just try it’. And she**’ll**start shaking her head and going, ‘No. I don’t want to’. Mum **will** put it near her mouth and she**’ll** start to cough.*

### Disapproval

*Will* is also used to talk about repeated behaviour which the speaker does not like or approve of. *Will* is normally stressed here:

- *He **will** leave his clothes all over the floor. It drives me mad.* (stronger than *He leaves his clothes all over the floor*.)

### Inanimate objects (things)

*Will* may be used to refer to inanimate objects and how they respond to humans, most typically in the negative form *won’t*:

- *The car **won’t** start.*
- *The door **won’t** open. It’s stuck.*

## Will and shall

We use *will* for all persons, but we often use *shall* with *I* and *we*. *Will* (*’ll*) is generally less formal than *shall* when used with *I* and *we*:

- *Simply complete the form and return it to me, and I **shall** personally reserve your hotel room for you.*
- *We **shall** look at a full report from the centre.*
- *We**’ll** see you in the morning.*

*Shall* also has a special legal use for talking about rules and laws. In these cases, we often use it with third-person subjects:

- *According to the basic principle of human rights, people **shall** not be discriminated against because of their nationality, race, age, sex, religion, occupation and social status.*

*Shall* and *will* are both used to talk about intentions and decisions. *Shall* is more formal than *will*.

*Will* is much more common than *shall* in both speaking and writing.

## Will: typical error

We use *will* or *’ll* to express intentions or decisions, or to make offers, not the present simple:

- *I**’ll** never go to her house again.*
- Not: *~~I never go to her house again.~~*
- *I**’ll** help you with that suitcase.*
- Not: *~~I help you with that suitcase.~~*
