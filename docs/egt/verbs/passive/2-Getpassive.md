# Get passive

We form the standard passive with *be* + *\-ed* form. We form the *get* passive with *get* + *\-ed* form:

- *The trees in the garden **were** damaged in the wind.* (standard passive)
- *The trees in the garden **got** damaged in the wind.* (*get* passive)

We use the *get* passive especially in informal speaking. When we use the *get* passive, we also place a little more emphasis on the nature of the action itself or on the person involved in the action:

- *There were blizzards over night and the whole town **got** snowed in.* (‘Get snowed in’ here means to be unable to leave the town because of heavy falls of snow.)
- *I’ve got good news for you. Jim finally **got** promoted.*
- *They had only known each other for six months when they **got** married in Las Vegas.*

The *get* passive is commonly used in speaking of events that are negative or not desired:

- *They’ve worked there for three years but they still **got** sacked* (lost their jobs).
- *He feels his paintings **are** always **getting** criticised.*
- *Our car **got** stolen last night.*

We sometimes use a reflexive pronoun with the *get* passive. This suggests the subject was at least partly responsible for the event or made it happen:

- *I **got myself** locked out the other day. I stupidly left my keys in the bedroom.* (or *I **got** locked out* …)
