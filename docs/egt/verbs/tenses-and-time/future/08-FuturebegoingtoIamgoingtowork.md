# Future: be going to (I am going to work)

## Be going to: form

We use *be going to* + the base form of the verb:

- *I**’m going to** take a few exams at the end of the year.*
- *It**’s going to** be difficult to get a job during the summer as the tourist industry is suffering from the economic downturn.*

## Be going to: uses

*Be going to* is commonly used in informal styles.

### Intentions

We use *be going to* to talk about future plans and intentions. Usually the decision about the future plans has already been made:

- *She’**s going to** be a professional dancer when she grows up.*
- *I’**m going to** look for a new place to live next month.*

### Predictions

We use *be going to* to predict something that we think is certain to happen or which we have evidence for now:

- *It’s **going to** snow again soon.* (The speaker can probably see dark snow clouds.)
- *Look out! He**’s going to** break that glass.*

### Commands

We use *be going to* when we give commands or state that something is obligatory:

- \[parent to a child\]
- *You’**re going to** pick up all of those toys right now. This room is a mess!*

## Gonna (informal contexts)

Spoken English:

We use *gonna* /gənə/ instead of *going to* in informal contexts, especially in speaking and in song lyrics. We write *gonna* to show how to pronounce it:

- *Are you **gonna** try and get stuff sorted as soon as you can then?* (Are you going to try and get things organised as soon as you can?)
- *One day I’m **gonna** be a star.*

## Be going to or will?

*Will* is often used in a similar way to *be going to*. *Will* is used when we are talking about something with absolute certainty. *Be going to* is used when we want to emphasise our decision or the evidence in the present:

- \[An ‘A’ road is a main road. A ‘B’ road is a smaller road.\]
- *We are now very late so we**’re going to** take the ‘B’ road.* (the speaker refers to the present and emphasises the decision)
- *I know the ‘B’ road **will** be quicker at this time of day.* (the speaker states a fact)
