# Past perfect simple (I had worked)

## Past perfect simple: form

We use *had* + the *\-ed* form of the verb.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>+</td><td><i></i><i>I, she, he, it, you, we, they</i></td><td>(full form)<b><i>had</i></b></td><td><b><i>worked</i></b>.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i></i><i>I, she, he, it, you, we, they</i></td><td>(short form)<b><i>’d</i></b></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>−</td><td><i></i><i>I, she, he, it, you, we, they</i></td><td>(full form)<b><i>had not</i></b></td><td><b><i>worked</i></b>.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i></i><i>I, she, he, it, you, we, they</i></td><td>(short form)<b><i>hadn’t</i></b></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>? +</td><td><b><i>Had</i></b> <i>I, she, he, it, you, we, they</i></td><td><b><i>worked?</i></b></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>? −</td><td>(full form)<b><i>Had</i></b> <i>I, she, he, it, you, we, they</i></td><td><b><i>not</i></b></td><td><b><i>worked?</i></b></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>(short form)<b><i>Hadn’t</i></b> <i>I, she, he, it, you, we, they</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Past perfect simple: uses

### Time up to then

The past perfect refers to time up to a point in the past (time up to then), just as the present perfect refers to something that happened in the time up to the moment of speaking (time up to now):

- *I**’d*** ***seen** all of Elvis Presley’s movies by the time I was 20!*

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>I</i><b><i>’d</i></b><i> </i><b><i>been</i></b><i> to five countries in Europe by 2001.</i></td><td>Past perfect: ‘time up to then’ (<i>2001</i>).</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I</i><b><i>’ve</i></b><i> </i><b><i>been</i></b><i> to five countries in Europe.</i></td><td>Present perfect: ‘time up to now’.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Reported clauses

We commonly use the past perfect in reported clauses where the reporting verb (underlined) is in the past:

- *“Mr Hammond **drove** through a red light.”*
- *The policeman* said *Mr Hammond **had driven** through a red light.*
- *No one* told *me that the shop **had closed**.*
- *I phoned Katie and she* said *the kids **had had** a day off school so she**’d*** ***taken** them ice skating.*

We also use the past perfect when the reporting verb is a verb of perception and is in the past tense:

- *My Dad was really angry because he* heard *I **hadn’t come** home until 3 am!*
- *I* saw *she**’d*** ***bought** the DVD so I asked if I could borrow it.*
- *The doctor* felt *my mother **had got** worse since last week.*

### Talking about changed states

We often use the past perfect to refer to situations which have changed. In speaking, *had* is often stressed:

- A: *Are you going anywhere today?*
- B: *I **had planned** to go to the beach but look at the rain!* (*had* is stressed; the meaning is ‘I have now changed my mind’)
- *I’m very happy working as an engineer but I **had wanted** to be an actor when I was younger.*

### The past perfect in conditional clauses

We must use the past perfect when we imagine a different past in a clause with *if*:

- *I would have helped to paint the house if you**’d*** ***asked** me.* (You didn’t ask me.)
- *Sarah couldn’t come with us to the cinema. She would have loved it if she **had been** there.* (She wasn’t there.)

:::warning

We don’t use the past perfect in the main clause of a conditional sentence. It is only used in the conditional clause:

- *\[conditional clause\] If we **had seen** you walking, \[main clause\] we **would have stopped** to give you a lift.*
- Not: *~~If we had seen you walking, we had stopped~~* …
