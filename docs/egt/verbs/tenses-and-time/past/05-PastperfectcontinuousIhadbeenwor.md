## Past perfect continuous: uses

### Continuing events in the past

We use the past perfect continuous to talk about actions or events which started before a particular time in the past and were still in progress up to that time in the past:

- *It was so difficult to get up last Monday for school. I **had been working** on my essays the night before and I was very tired.*
- (The past perfect continuous focuses on the activity of working on the essays up to a particular time in the past.)

- A: *Why did you decide to go travelling for a year?*
- B: *Well, I**’d*** ***been reading** an amazing book about a woman who rode a horse around South America. I was just halfway through the book when I decided I had to go travelling and that was it. I just took a year out of work and went*.
- (The past perfect continuous focuses on the activity of reading the book at the time when she made her decision. She hadn’t finished the book when she made her decision.)

We can use the past perfect continuous to talk about events which started before a time in the past and which finished, but where the effects or results were still important at a point in the past:

- *It **had been raining** and the ground was still wet.*
