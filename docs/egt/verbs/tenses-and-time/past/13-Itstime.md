# It’s time

We can use the expression *it’s time* + subject + past verb form to refer to the present moment:

- *Gosh! It’s almost midnight. **It’s time we went** home.*
- Not: *~~It’s time we go home.~~*

*It’s time* with a verb in the *to*\-infinitive form can refer to the speaker and the listener together:

- *Come on. **It’s time to start** packing. We have to leave in two hours.* (or ***It’s time we*** ***started*** *packing*.)
