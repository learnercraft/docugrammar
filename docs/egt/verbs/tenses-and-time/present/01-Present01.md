# Present

Present time refers to the time around the moment of writing or speaking (time around now) and to general and permanent time. The two most common ways to refer to present time are the present simple for general facts and regular events, and the present continuous for an event happening now:

- *Water **turns** to ice at below 0°.* (present simple for a general fact)
- ***Does*** *it **rain** a lot in Wales?* (present simple asking about a general fact)
- *I usually **take** the bus to work.* (present simple for a regular event)
- *Take an umbrella with you. It**’s*** ***raining**.* (present continuous for something happening now)
