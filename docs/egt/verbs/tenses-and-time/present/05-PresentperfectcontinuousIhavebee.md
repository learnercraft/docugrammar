## Present perfect continuous: uses

### Recent past activities

We use the present perfect continuous to talk about a finished activity in the recent past. Using the present perfect continuous focuses on the activity.

We don’t give a specific time. Even though the activity is finished, we can see the result in the present:

- *I**’ve** just **been*** ***cleaning** the car.* (The car is wet and clean.)
- *It**’s*** ***been*** ***snowing**.* (The ground is covered in snow.)
- *What **have** you **been buying**?*

### One continuing event

We use the present perfect continuous for a single activity that began at a point in the past and is still continuing:

- *I**’ve*** ***been*** ***reading** your book – it’s great.* (I’m still reading it.)
- *He**’s been living** in the village since 1995.* (He is still living in the village.)
- *She **has been writing** her autobiography since 1987.*

### Repeated continuing events

We use the present perfect continuous to talk about repeated activities which started at a particular time in the past and are still continuing up until now:

- *I**’ve*** ***been going** to Spain on holiday every year since 1987.*
- *I **haven’t been eating** much lunch lately. I**’ve*** ***been*** ***going** to the gym at lunchtimes.*
- *She**’s*** ***been*** ***playing** tennis on and off for three years.*

### How long …?

We often use the present perfect continuous to ask and answer questions about the duration of an activity. We use the question *How long …+* present perfect continuous:

- A: *How long **have** you **been waiting** for me?*
- B: *About ten minutes. Not too long*. (*I’ve been waiting for about ten minutes*.)
