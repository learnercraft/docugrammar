# Present: typical errors

We always use the *\-s* form for third person singular present simple:

- *Good health **depends** on having a good diet.*
- Not: *~~Good health depend on having a good diet.~~*
- *The building **has** three rooms.*
- Not: *~~The building have three rooms.~~*

We don’t use the present simple for actions that are going on at the present time. We use the present continuous:

- *Look, she**’s*** ***winning**!*
- Not: *~~Look, she wins!~~*

We use the present simple, not *will*, for future reference after words like *when*, *before*, *as soon as*, *if* and *whether*:

- *We’ll come and pick you up as soon as you **call**.*
- Not: *~~We’ll come and pick you up as soon as you’ll call.~~*

We don’t use the present continuous for facts and permanent situations. We use the present simple:

- *Six plus four **makes** ten.* (6 + 4 = 10)
- Not: *~~Six plus four is making ten.~~*

We don’t use the present continuous with some verbs, e.g. verbs expressing feelings, describing senses, mental process verbs:

- *Horrible weather, isn’t it? But I **hear** it’s going to get better at the weekend.*
- Not: *~~I’m hearing it’s going to get better.~~*
- *Some children **hate** playing any sport.*
- Not: *~~Some children are hating~~* …

We don’t use the present simple or the present continuous before *since* when we talk about a specific time up to now. We use the present perfect:

- *I**’ve*** ***been** here since 4 o’clock.*
- Not: *~~I’m here since 4 o’clock.~~*
