# Help somebody (to) do

We use *help* with or without an object:

- *Let me **help** you.*
- *Can I **help**?*

We also use *help* with an object and an infinitive with or without *to*:

- *Jack is **helping me to tidy** my CDs. or Jack is **helping me tidy** my CDs.*
- *I am writing to thank you for **helping us find** the right hotel for our holiday.* or *I am writing to thank you for **helping us to find** the right hotel for our holiday.*

:::warning

We don’t use *help* with an *\-ing* form:

- *I am trying to **help him look** for a new bike.*
- Not: *~~I am trying to help him looking~~* …
