# Adjuncts

Adjuncts are one of the five major elements of clause structure. The other four are subject (s), verb (v), object (o) and complement (c). Adjuncts (a) are sometimes called adverbials.

An adjunct is a phrase which is not necessary to the structure of the clause, but which adds some extra meaning to it.

In the sentence *They waited outside for ages*, the phrases *outside* and *for ages* add extra meaning to *waited*. They tell us where, and for how long, the people waited. They are adjuncts:

- *\[S\] They \[V\] waited \[A\] **outside** \[A\] **for ages**.*
- *\[S\] I \[V\] kept \[O\] a copy of the letter \[A\] **in my desk**.*
- *\[S\] She \[A\] **quickly** \[V\] realised \[O\] her mistake.*
- *\[A\] **Suddenly**, \[S\] it \[V\] started to rain.*

## Adjuncts and complements

Adjuncts and complements are different. An adjunct is not necessary, and adds extra information. A complement is necessary in order to complete the meaning:

- *\[S\] He \[V\] put \[O\] some salt \[C\] **in the soup**.*

The verb *put* must have a complement saying *where* something is put. Without the complement (*in the soup*), the clause would not be complete. We cannot just say *He put some salt*.

## Adjuncts and postmodifiers in noun phrases

Adjuncts are different from postmodifiers in noun phrases. An adjunct adds extra information to a clause. A postmodifier tells us more about the noun (n):

- *\[S\] They \[V\] â€™ve closed \[N\] that restaurant \[postmodifier\] on Market Street.*

*on Market Street* is a postmodifier. It is part of the object noun phrase. It tells us which restaurant we are talking about.
