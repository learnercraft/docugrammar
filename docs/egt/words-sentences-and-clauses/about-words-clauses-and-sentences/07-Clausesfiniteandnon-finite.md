# Clauses: finite and non-finite

## Finite clauses

Finite clauses must contain a verb which shows tense. They can be main clauses or subordinate clauses:

- ***Is*** *it **raining**?* (main: present)
- *I **spoke** to Joanne last night.* (main: past)
- *We **didn’t** get any food because we **didn’t** have enough time.* (main: past; subordinate: past)

## Non-finite clauses

Non-finite clauses contain a verb which does not show tense. We usually use non-finite verbs only in subordinate clauses. We usually understand the time referred to from the context of the main clause. We often use a non-finite clause when the subject is the same as the subject in the main clause:

- *I had something to eat **before leaving**.* (I had something to eat before I left.)
- ***After having spent*** *six hours at the hospital, they eventually came home.*
- ***Helped by local volunteers****, staff at the museum have spent many years sorting and cataloguing more than 100,000 photographs.*
- *He left the party and went home, **not having anyone to talk to**.*
- *The person to ask **about going to New Zealand** is Beck.*
- *You have to look at the picture really carefully **in order to see all the detail**.*

### After, although, though, and if

We often use non-finite clauses after some subordinating conjunctions like *after*, *although, though* and *if*:

- *By the end of the day, **although exhausted**, Mark did not feel quite as tired as he had in the past.* (although he was exhausted)
- *The proposal, **if accepted by Parliament**, will mean fundamental changes to the education system.*

### After verbs + \-ing or infinitive with to

We use non-finite clauses as the complements to verbs which take *\-ing* or *to*\-infinitive after them:

- *I don’t **enjoy playing** tennis in the rain.*
- *I’d **hate to travel** to London every day.*

### Relative clauses

A relative clause can be non-finite when the subject of the relative clause is the same as the subject of the main clause:

- *The man **sitting on the sofa over there** is Simon’s brother.* (The man who is sitting …)
- *Don’t forget to fill in the form **attached to the letter**.* (… which is attached to the letter.)
