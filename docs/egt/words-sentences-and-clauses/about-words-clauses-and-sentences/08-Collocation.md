# Collocation

Collocation refers to how words go together or form fixed relationships.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>typical collocations</td><td>incorrect/untypical collocations</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>heavy</i></b><i> rain</i></td><td><s>thick rain</s></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>high</i></b><i> temperature</i></td><td><s>tall temperature</s></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>scenic</i></b><i> view</i></td><td><s>scenic picture</s></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>have</i></b><i> an experience</i></td><td><s>do/make an experience</s></td></tr></tbody></table>

- *She has **blonde** hair.*
- Not: *~~She has beige hair.~~*
- *She was **discharged** from hospital.*
- Not: *~~She was released from hospital.~~*

Collocations may be strong or weak. Strong collocations are where the link between the two words is quite fixed and restricted. Weak collocations are where a word can collocate with many other words.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>strong<i>make</i><i>express +</i> <b><i>a wish</i></b><i>fulfil</i></td><td>Very few words can collocate with the noun <i>wish</i>. This makes <i>wish a</i> strong collocator.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>weak<i>apartment, beach, car, camera, chance</i>,<b><i>big</i></b> <i>+ disappointment, fight, gun, lamp, moon, news</i>,<i>ocean, pain, pity, price, queue, table, umbrella</i>,<i>upset, wait, window</i></td><td><i>big</i> can collocate with hundreds of words, therefore itâ€™s a weak collocator.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Strong collocations

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>whisk an egg</i></td><td><i>curly hair</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>winding road</i></td><td><i>blissfully ignorant</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Weak collocations

1. *big/enormous/large + house/lorry/cup*

2. *fast/shiny/expensive + car/motorbike/aeroplane*

3. *very/really/extremely + interesting/hot/generous*

4. *brown/straight/long + fence/hair/line*

Becoming aware of collocations is part of vocabulary learning. All languages have a large number of collocating words. A good dictionary will help you and dictionaries of collocations are also available.
