# Complements

Complements are one of the five major elements of clause structure. The other four are subject, verb, object and adjunct (complements are in bold):

- *Both the brothers became **doctors**.*
- A: *Have you seen my umbrella?*
- B: *It’s* ***downstairs***, *by the back door*.
- *Playing the guitar always makes me **happy**.*

## Subject and object complements

In clauses with linking verbs (*be, seem, become*), complements which follow the verb and which add information about the subject are called subject complements:

- *Sheila is **a nurse**.* (adding information about Sheila)
- *All of them seemed **surprised**.*

Complements which add more information about an object are called object complements:

- *He makes **me very angry**.* (adding information about me)

## Complements and adjuncts

Complements and adjuncts are different. A complement is necessary in order to complete the meaning. An adjunct is not necessary, and adds extra information.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>He put the cake </i><b><i>in the oven</i></b><i>.</i>Not: <s>He put the cake.</s></td><td><i>put</i> must have a complement to say where something is put. Without the complement, the clause would not be complete.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>We usually go away </i><b><i>in the spring</i></b><i>.</i></td><td><i>in the spring</i> is an adjunct. It is not essential to complete the verb ‘go away’; it adds extra information.</td></tr></tbody></table>
