# Ellipsis

Ellipsis happens when we leave out (in other words, when we don’t use) items which we would normally expect to use in a sentence if we followed the grammatical rules. The following examples show ellipsis. The items left out are in brackets \[ \]:

- *I am absolutely sure \[that\] I have met her somewhere before.*
- A: \[*Have you*\] *Seen my gloves anywhere?*
- B: *They’re in the kitchen*.
- *She sang and \[she\] played the violin at the same time.*
- A: \[*Are*\] *You ready yet?*
- B: *Yes*. \[*I’m*\] *Ready now*. \[*I’m*\] *Sorry to keep you waiting*.

In fact, when we use ellipsis appropriately, no one thinks we have ‘left out’ anything, and ellipsis is normal and very common, especially in informal conversation.

## Textual ellipsis

When we can easily understand everything in the sentence because of the surrounding text, we use textual ellipsis. For example, we know that certain verbs and adjectives can be followed by a *that*\-clause, so if we see a clause without *that* after such verbs and adjectives, we assume that the writer or speaker wants us to understand the same meaning as a *that*\-clause:

- *I knew \[that\] something terrible had happened.*
- *Maureen was glad \[that\] we had called in to see her.*
- *Are you afraid \[that\] you won’t get a job when you leave college?*

The same happens when we do not repeat words in clauses connected with *and*, *but* and *or* (coordinated clauses). We understand what the ‘missing’ items are:

- *We went for a walk and \[we\] took some lovely photographs.*
- *He wrote to \[everyone he could think of who might help\] and \[he\] phoned everyone he could think of who might help.*
- *I can remember his face but \[I\] can’t remember his name.*
- *Do you want to stay in or \[do you want to\] go out tonight?*

We can also leave out the complement of a verb when it is obvious what the complement is:

- A: *Why don’t they move to a bigger place?*
- B: *They don’t want to* \[*move to a bigger place*\]. *They’re happy where they are*.
- A: *Have more coffee*.
- B: *I’d better not* \[*have more coffee*\]. *I won’t be able to sleep later*.

## Situational ellipsis

### Subject pronouns

When we do not need to mention someone or something because it is obvious from the immediate situation, we use situational ellipsis. Situational ellipsis often means we do not need to use the subject pronoun *I*, especially at the beginning of a clause. This is quite informal:

- *\[I\] Wonder where Joe Healey is these days?*
- *Bye! \[I\] Hope you have a nice holiday.*

We can also omit a third person pronoun (*he*, *she*, *it*, *they*) at the beginning of a clause in informal conversation when it is obvious who or what we are referring to:

- A: *I saw Janice in town*. \[*She*\] *Said she’s getting married next year*.
- B: *Really?*
- A: *Yeah*. \[*She*\] *Met some guy and got engaged to him after only a couple of weeks, apparently*.
- *There’s something wrong with the car. \[It\] Started making a funny noise on the way home.*

### Subjects and auxiliary verbs

In informal conversation, we can leave out both a subject pronoun such as *I* or *you* and an accompanying auxiliary verb at the beginning of a clause when the meaning is obvious. This is most common in questions:

- *\[Have you\] Finished with the newspaper?*
- *\[I’ve\] Lost my car keys again. Have you seen them?*

- A: \[*Do you*\] *Want some coffee?*
- B: *Is there any?*
- A: *Yeah*. \[*I’ve*\] *Just made some*.

### Auxiliary verbs

In questions in informal conversation, with the second person pronoun *you*, we can leave out the auxiliary verb only:

- *\[Have\] You finished your essay yet?*
- *\[Are\] You going to the match on Saturday?*

We can also do the same in informal conversation in questions with third person noun subjects:

- *\[Is\] Richard coming tonight?*
- *\[Has\] Claire bought a new car yet? She said she was going to.*

We don’t normally do this with the first person pronoun *I*:

- *Am I making too much noise?*
- Not: *~~I making too much noise?~~*

### Questions with question tags

In questions in informal conversation, we can leave out a subject pronoun, or a subject pronoun and an accompanying auxiliary verb, when we use a question tag:

- *\[He\] Gave up his job, **did he**? I thought he would.*
- *\[You\] Wrote to the local newspaper, **did you**? Good idea.*
- A: *He was asked to leave the room*.
- B: *Yes*. \[*He*\] *Didn’t like it*, ***did he****?*
- A: *No. He wasn’t at all happy*.

- A: *Pat and Cathy certainly had a long break from work*.
- B: *Yeah*. \[*They*\] *Went away for a month*, ***didn’t they****?*

### Articles

In informal conversation, we can sometimes omit articles (*a/an, the*) when they are obvious from the context and when we use them at the beginning of a sentence:

- *\[The\] Dog wants to go out. Can you open the door for him?*

A: *What are you looking for?*

- B: \[*A*\] *Pen. Can you see one anywhere?*
- *\[The\] Postman’s just been. There’s a letter for you.*

### Fixed expressions

We often leave out the first word of a fixed expression in informal conversation because we know the listener will understand the expression:

- *I’d love to go with you. \[The\] **Trouble is**, I’ve got to work on Saturday this week.*
- *I can’t read that. I’m \[as\] **blind as a bat** without my glasses.*

### Substitution

Substitution is similar to ellipsis in many ways, because both enable the speaker to reduce what they are saying. Ellipsis is simply leaving something out that is usually obvious. Substitution involves using words such as *do* and *so* and *not* instead of a clause.
