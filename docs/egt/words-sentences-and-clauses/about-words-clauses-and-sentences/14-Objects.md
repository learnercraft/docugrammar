# Objects

An object is one of the five major elements of clause structure. The other four are subject, verb, adjunct and complement.

Objects are typically noun phrases (a noun or pronoun and any dependent words before or after it). Objects normally follow the verb in a clause:

- *Everyone likes **her**. She knows **everyone**.*
- *They didn’t take **their mountain bikes** with them.*
- A: *Have you seen **the car keys**?*
- B: *Yes I had **them** earlier*.

There are direct objects and indirect objects. A direct object (in bold) is the thing or person that is affected by the action of the verb. An indirect object (underlined) is usually a person (or animal) who receives a direct object:

- *They gave* her ***a present*** *when she left.*
- *Can you get* me ***some butter****?*

## Direct objects

A direct object shows who or what the action of the verb affects:

- *That computer hasn’t got **a mouse**.*
- *Nobody writes **letters** these days.*
- *Does she play **tennis**?*

## Indirect objects

An indirect object is usually a person or an animal. The indirect object (underlined) receives or is affected by the direct object (in bold). An indirect object always needs a direct object with it and always comes before the direct object:

- *She gave* the dog ***its dinner****.*
- *Do I owe* you ***some money****?*

We can often rephrase such sentences with a prepositional phrase using *to* or *for* + the recipient. In this case, the direct object usually comes first.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>indirect + direct object</td><td>direct object + prepositional phrase with <i>to/for</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>He always gives </i>the class<i> </i><b><i>too much homework</i></b><i>.</i></td><td><i>He always gives </i><b><i>too much homework</i></b><i> </i>to the class<i>.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I never buy </i>her<i> </i><b><i>flowers</i></b><i>. She’s allergic to them.</i></td><td><i>I never buy </i><b><i>flowers</i></b><i> </i>for her<i>. She’s allergic to them.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

Here are some verbs that often take an indirect object + direct object or a prepositional phrase with *to*:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>bring</i></td><td><i>lend</i></td><td><i>owe</i></td><td><i>show</i></td><td><i>tell</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>give</i></td><td><i>offer</i></td><td><i>promise</i></td><td><i>teach</i></td><td><i>write</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

Here are some verbs that often take an indirect object + direct object or a prepositional phrase with *for*:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>buy</i></td><td><i>find</i></td><td><i>get</i></td><td><i>make</i></td><td><i>order</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>save</i></td><td><br/></td><td><br/></td><td><br/></td><td><br/></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Verbs and objects

Some verbs (often called transitive verbs) need an object to complete their meaning. Some verbs (often called intransitive verbs) do not take an object. Some verbs need both a direct object and an indirect object. Some verbs can take a *wh*\-clause or a *that*\-clause as an object.

Some examples of verbs and objects:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>verb + object</td><td><i>We really enjoyed </i><b><i>the evening</i></b><i>. Thanks.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>verb + no object</td><td><i>Paula smiled and left.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>verb + two objects</td><td><i>They gave </i>us<i> </i><b><i>coffee</i></b><i>.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>verb + <i>wh</i>-clause</td><td><i>I can’t believe </i><b><i>what he told me</i></b><i>.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>verb + <i>that</i>-clause</td><td><i>I know (</i><b><i>that) you’re telling the truth</i></b><i>.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

Many phrasal verbs (underlined below) take an object:

- *We won’t* give out ***your email address*** *to other companies.*
- *They’ve* put ***the price of fuel*** up *again.*

All prepositional verbs (underlined below) take an object after the preposition:

- *I don’t* listen to ***the radio*** *much.*
- *It* depends on ***the*** ***weather****.*

### No objects with linking verbs

We don’t use objects with linking verbs (*appear, be, become, look, seem*, etc.). We use adjective phrases, noun phrases, adverb phrases or prepositional phrases as subject complements (underlined below), to give more information about the subject:

- *This is Lucy. She****’s*** my sister-in-law*.*
- *I* ***felt*** really tired*.*
- *I* ***was*** in the garden *when you rang.*
