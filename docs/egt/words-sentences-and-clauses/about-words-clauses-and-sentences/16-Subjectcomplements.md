# Subject complements

A subject complement gives us more information about the subject. It usually comes after linking verbs and sense verbs (including *be, seem, smell, taste*), and after change of state verbs (including *go, get, become*).

## Subject complements: parts of speech

Subject complements can be adjective phrases, noun phrases, adverb phrases or prepositional phrases:

- *That rice tastes **quite sweet**.* (subject + adjective phrase)
- *It seems **a long time** since this morning.* (subject + noun phrase)
- A: Where are you?
- B: *I’m* ***upstairs***. (subject + adverb phrase)
- *It still smells **of paint** in here.* (subject + prepositional phrase)

Subject complements are not the same as objects.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>He married</i> <b><i>a famous writer</i></b>.</td><td><i>a famous writer</i> is a different person = the object</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>He became</i> <b><i>a famous writer</i></b>.</td><td><i>become</i> is a linking verb; <i>a famous writer</i> describes the subject = the same person as <i>he</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

Complements and adjuncts are different. A complement is necessary in order to complete the meaning. An adjunct is not necessary, and adds extra information.

## Pronouns as subject complements

When we use a pronoun as a subject complement after *be*, we usually use an object pronoun (e.g. *me, him, us*):

- *The dog barked before we even came to the door. He knew it was **us**.*
- Not: *~~He knew it was we~~*.

- *You know the girl I was telling you about? Well, that’s **her** over there.*
- Not: *~~Well, that’s she over there~~*.

In some formal contexts we use the subject pronoun (e.g. *I, he, they, we*):

- *I can’t exactly remember whether it was **he** who asked me to go with them.* (less formal: *… whether it was **him** who …*)
