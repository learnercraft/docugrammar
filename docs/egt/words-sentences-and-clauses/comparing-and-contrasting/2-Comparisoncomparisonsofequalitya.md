# Comparison: comparisons of equality (as tall as his father)

## As … as …

If two things are equal in some way, we can use a comparison with *as* … *as* …. The comparisons may involve adjectives (adj) or adverbs (adv) after the first *as*, and noun phrases (np) or clauses after the second *as*:

- *He’s grown so much. He’s **as*** tall ***as*** his father ***now**.* (adj + noun phrase)
- *The team is still* ***as*** good ***as*** it was five years ago*.* (adj + clause)
- *The second game didn’t go* ***as*** well ***as*** the first one*.* (adv + noun phrase)
- *The company is not performing* ***as*** successfully ***as*** it did when Arthur Carling was the President*.* (adv + clause)

When the second part of the comparison is a clause, the clause is often a reduced clause (a clause with ellipsis) or one with a substitute verb *do* or a modal verb:

- *If the sales figures are **as bad as predicted**, the company will probably go bankrupt.*
- (…as bad as economists have predicted…)

- *I worked as hard **as I had ever done in my life** for my final exam.*
- (…as hard as I had ever worked in my life …)

- *We tried as hard **as we could**.*

## Noun phrases

If we use *as … as* … with a noun phrase, we must use *much* or *little* + uncountable noun or *many* or *few* + plural noun:

- *She had **as much work** as she needed and did not want to take on any more.*
- *There are **as many students** in Class 2A as there are in 2B.*
- *He spent **as little money** as he could.*

## Negative forms

We can form the negative of *as … as* … with *not as … as* …, or with *not so … as* … The form *not as … as* … is more common:

- *He did**n’t** run **as fast as** he did in the European Championship.*
- *He did**n’t** pay **as much tax** this year **as** last year because he earned less.*
- *She’s **not*** ***so shy as** she used to be.* (less common)
- *I do**n’t** read **so many novels** now **as** I used to.* (less common)
