# Conditionals

## Conditionals: imagined situations

Conditional sentences consider imagined or uncertain situations and the possible results of these situations. The most common types of conditional sentences involve *if*:

- *\[imagined situation\] **If** I get the job in Milan, \[result\] I’ll be pretty happy.*
- *\[outcome\] We’ll have the party in the garden \[imagined situation\] **as long as** it doesn’t rain.*
- (or … ***if*** *it doesn’t rain*. or … ***on*** ***condition*** *that it doesn’t rain*.)

## Conditional sentences

Conditional sentences consist of a conditional clause and a main clause:

- *\[conditional clause\] **If** a lot of people come, \[main clause\] we’ll have to get extra chairs.*
- *\[conditional clause\] **Unless** you book weeks in advance, \[main clause\] you won’t get a flight.*

The verb in the conditional clause reflects the speaker’s point of view on whether the imagined situation is likely or impossible:

- *If you **win** the next match, **will** you be in the semi-final?* (present simple + *will* indicates the speaker thinks winning the match is possible or likely)
- *If I **won** a million pounds, I **would give** this job up tomorrow!* (past simple + *would* indicates the speaker thinks winning a million pounds is not likely to happen)
- *If we **had won** the competition, we **would have had** a free trip to Moscow.* (past perfect + *would have* refers to an impossible condition – the event did not happen)

## Order of clauses

Conditional clauses usually come before main clauses but they may also come after them:

- ***If you see Dora****, will you give her a message?* (conditional clause first; a comma is normally used in writing)
- *I’ll go to Bristol tomorrow **if the weather is good**.* (conditional clause second; a comma is not normally used in writing)

## Verb forms in the conditional clause

The verb in the conditional clause may be in the simple form or the continuous form, depending on the meaning:

- *If you **owe** money, you must pay it back immediately.* (simple)
- *If you’**re feeling** hungry, we can go and get something to eat.* (continuous)
- *If he **had** time, he always called in to see us.* (simple)
- *If they **were working**, we always tried not to disturb them.* (continuous)
