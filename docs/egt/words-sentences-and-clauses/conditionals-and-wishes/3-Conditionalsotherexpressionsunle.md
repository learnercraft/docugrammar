# Conditionals: other expressions (unless, should, as long as)

## Unless

Conditional clauses can begin with *unless*. *Unless* means something similar to ‘if … not’ or ‘except if’.

The verb forms in the examples are similar to sentences with *if*: we use the present simple in the *unless*\-clause and *shall, should, will, would, can, could, may* or *might* in the main clause:

- ***Unless*** *I **phone** you, you **can** assume the train’s on time.* (If I do not phone you /except if I phone you, you can assume the train is on time.)
- *We’ll have to cancel the show **unless** we **sell** more tickets at the last minute.* (We’ll have to cancel the show if we do not sell more tickets/except if we sell more tickets at the last minute.)

:::warning

We don’t use *unless* for impossible conditions:

- ***If*** *the government had **not** raised food prices, there would not have been so many protests.*
- Not: *~~Unless the government had raised food prices~~* …

:::warning

We don’t use *unless* and *if* together:

- *We’ll go to the coast tomorrow **unless** it rains.*
- Not: *~~We’ll go to the coast tomorrow unless if it rains.~~*

- *If so*, *if not*

## Should you (Should with inversion)

In formal situations, we can use *should* + subject (s) + verb (v) instead of *if*:

- ***Should*** ***you*** *wish to cancel your order, please contact our customer service department on 02317 6658932.* (or *If you should wish to cancel your order* …)
- ***Should*** ***your child*** *become anxious or nervous about any activity, it is a good idea to inform the team-leader.* (or *If your child should become* …)

## Had you (Had with inversion)

In formal situations, we can use *had +* subject + verb instead of *if* in third conditional sentences:

- ***Had*** ***I*** *known you were waiting outside, I would have invited you to come in.* (If I had known you were waiting outside …)
- ***Had*** ***Margaret*** *realised she would be travelling alone, she would never have agreed to go.*

## If + were to

In formal situations, we can use *if + were to* when we talk about things that might happen but which we think are unlikely:

- ***If*** *the Prime Minister **were to** resign, there would have to be a general election within 30 days.*

In even more formal styles, we use *were* + subject-verb inversion + *to-*infinitive:

- *\[V\] **Were** \[S\] **we** \[to -INF\] **to give up** the fight now, it would mean the end of democracy in our country.* (If we gave up the fight now …)
- *\[V\] **Were** \[S\] **the economy** \[to -INF\] **to slow down** too quickly, there would be major problems.* (If the economy slowed down too quickly …)

## As long as, so long as, providing, etc

Sometimes we need to impose specific conditions or set limits on a situation. In these cases, conditional clauses can begin with phrases such as *as long as, so long as, only if, on condition that, providing (that*), *provided (that*).

*As long as* is more common in speaking; *so long as* and *on condition that* are more formal and more common in writing:

- \[to a group of children\]
- *You can play in the living room **as long as** you don’t make a mess.*
- ***So long as*** *a tiger stands still, it is invisible in the jungle.*
- *The bank lent the company 100,000 pounds **on condition that** they repaid the money within six months.*

*Providing (that*) is more common in speaking; *provided (that*) is more formal and more common in written language:

- \[talking about rail travel in the UK\]
- *You can get a senior citizen’s reduction **providing** you’ve got a railcard.*
- *They may do whatever they like **provided that** it is within the law.*

## Or and otherwise

We often use *or* and *otherwise* with conditional meanings:

- *You’ve got to start studying, **or** you’ll fail all those exams.* (If you don’t start studying, you will fail the exams.)
- \[talking about sending a package by mail\]
- *We’d better send it express, **otherwise** it’ll take days.* (If we do not send it express, it will take days.)

## Supposing

*Supposing* may be used with a conditional meaning. It can be used in first, second or third conditional sentences. The speaker invites the listener to imagine a situation:

- ***Supposing*** *I don’t arrive till after midnight, will the guest-house still be open?* (Imagine if I don’t arrive till after midnight …)
- ***Supposing*** *you lost your passport, you’d have to go to the embassy, wouldn’t you?*
- ***Supposing*** *he hadn’t recognised us – he might never have spoken to us.*
