# If only

We use *if only* to express a strong wish that things could be different. It means the same as *I wish* but is stronger. We use it to talk about past, present and future unreal conditions.

We use *if only* + past verb forms to talk about a wish for the present:

- ***If only*** *he knew the truth.* (he doesn’t know the truth, but he wishes he did)
- Not: *~~If only he knows the truth.~~*
- ***If only*** *there was something she could do or say to help.*
- Not: *~~If only there is something she could do or say to help.~~*

We sometimes use *were* instead of *was* in more formal situations:

- ***If only*** *she weren’t so tired.* (If only she wasn’t so tired.)

To talk about a wish for the future or to show a contrast between how things are and how we would like them to be, we use *if only* + *would* + infinitive without *to*:

- ***If only*** *someone would buy the house.*
- ***If only*** *they would talk to each other.*

We use *if only* + past perfect to talk about a wish to change something that has already happened:

- ***If only*** *he had listened to what his friends had been telling him.* (He didn’t listen.)
- ***If only*** *Anna had been able to come.* (Anna wasn’t able to come.)
