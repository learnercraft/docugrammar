# Conjunctions

Conjunctions are linking words like *and, or, but, then* and *because*:

- *They knocked down all the houses **and** they built a car park.*
- *Are there four **or** five people living in that house?*
- *My shoes look great **but** are not very comfortable.*

## And, but, either … or, etc. (coordinating conjunctions)

Coordinating conjunctions connect items which are the same grammatical type, e.g. words, phrases, clauses. The most common coordinating conjunctions are *and, or, but*.

### One-word conjunctions

Connecting words

- *Which do you prefer? \[word\] Red **or** \[word\] blue?*

Connecting phrases

- *The meal was \[phrase\] very expensive **and** \[phrase\] not very nice.*

Connecting clauses

- *\[clause\] There are seats outside **but** \[clause\] some people don’t like sitting outdoors.*

Connecting sentences

- *My grandmother’s name was Wall. **But** she became Jenkins when she got married to my grandfather.*
- (In very formal writing, we don’t normally start a sentence with *but*.)

Connecting prefixes

- *\[prefix\] Pro- **and** \[prefix\] anti-government supporters waited outside the parliament.*
- (*Pro- and anti-government supporters waited outside the parliament.*)

### Two-word conjunctions

Some coordinating conjunctions have two parts: *either … or* …, *neither … nor* …, *both … and* …:

- *You can drink chocolate milk **either** hot in the winter **or** cold in the summer.*
- ***Neither*** *Lisa **nor** Helena had been to Italy before.* (Lisa hadn’t been to Italy before and Helena hadn’t been to Italy before.)
- ***Both*** *you **and** I know what really happened.* (You know and I know what happened.)

:::warning

Apart from two-word conjunctions, we only use one conjunction to connect words or phrases:

- ***Because*** *my alarm didn’t go off, I was late for work.*
- Not: *~~Because my alarm didn’t go off, so I was late for work.~~*

## After, although, as soon as, etc. (subordinating conjunctions)

Common subordinating conjunctions are: *after, (al)though, as, before, if, since, that, until, when, whereas, while, once, so, as soon as, provided that*. When a clause follows these conjunctions, it becomes a subordinate clause, which needs a main clause to make a complete sentence.

### One-word conjunctions

- *\[subordinate clause\] **After** we had talked on the phone, \[main clause\] I wrote down what we had decided.*
- *\[main clause\] Everyone enjoyed the fishing trip \[subordinate clause\] **although** no one caught any fish!*
- *\[subordinate clause\] **Before** we left at four o’clock, \[main clause\] we had something to eat.*

When the subordinate clause comes before the main clause, we usually put a comma at the end of the clause. When the main clause comes first, we don’t need to use a comma.

- *As*
- *As* … *as*
- *Before*
- *If*
- *Once*
- *Since*
- *So*
- *That*
- *Until*
- *When*
- *Whereas*
- *While* and *whilst*

### Conjunctions with more than one word

Some subordinating conjunctions consist of more than one word: *as long as*, *as soon as*, *except that*, *in order that*, *so as to*, *provided that*:

- ***As long as*** *the waves are high enough, we can go surfing.*
- ***Provided that*** *he pays a fine, he will not have to go to jail.* (formal)

### Conjunctions that can be modified by adverbs

Some subordinating conjunctions may be modified by adverbs (underlined). For example, *just when, ever since, only if, just as, simply because, right before*:

- *The phone rang* just ***when*** *I’d gone to bed.*
- *I have been afraid to swim in the sea* ever ***since*** *I was young.*

### Position of subordinating conjunctions

Words and phrases such as *above all*, *anyway*, *as a result*, *as well*, *eventually*, *firstly*, *however*, *overall*, *rather*, *then*, *therefore*, *though*, *on the contrary* (linking adjuncts) can create similar meanings to conjunctions (e.g. adding, cause and effect). These words are adverb phrases and can come in any position which an adverb can occupy:

- *He left home late. **(As a result**) he **(as a result**) didn’t arrive until 8 pm **(as a result**).*

We cannot do this with subordinating conjunctions, which must come at the beginning of the clause. Subordinating conjunctions create a grammatical connection between two clauses, making one dependent on the other.

Compare

- Subordinating conjunction *so*

| Sentence          | Explanation                           |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| *He couldn’t get money from the bank* ***so*** *he couldn’t buy a house.*        | These two sentences mean the same thing but they are connected differently:<br/>*So* makes a subordinating link between the cause/reason (*He couldn’t get money from the bank*) and the result (*he couldn’t buy a house*). This is a grammatical link. The position of *so* cannot change.          |

- Linking adjunct *as a result*

| Sentence               | Explanation       |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|
| *He couldn’t get money from the bank. **As a result** he couldn’t buy a house.*       | *As a result* creates a link between two clauses based on meaning. We can move *as a result* (*He couldn’t get money from the bank. He couldn’t buy a house **as a result**.*)           |
