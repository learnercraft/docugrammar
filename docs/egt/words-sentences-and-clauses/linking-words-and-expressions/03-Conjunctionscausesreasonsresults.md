# Conjunctions: causes, reasons, results and purpose

Conjunctions describing causes, reasons, results and purpose are subordinating conjunctions.

## Conjunctions: causes, reasons and results

The following conjunctions are commonly used to connect causes/reasons and results. *Because, as* and *since* are very similar in meaning.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>conjunction</td><td>cause/reason</td><td>result</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Because</i><i>Since</i><i>As</i></td><td><i>our local shop has closed,</i></td><td><i>I have to go a supermarket two miles away to get my groceries.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

Or

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>result</td><td>conjunction</td><td>cause/reason</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I don’t buy the paper every morning any more</i></td><td><i>because</i><i>since</i><i>as</i><i>now (that)</i></td><td><i>our local shop has closed.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

:::note[See also]

- *As*, *because* or *since*?

:::

Or

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>cause/reason</td><td>conjunction</td><td>result</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Our local shop has closed</i></td><td><i>so</i></td><td><i>I don’t buy the paper every morning any more.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

:::warning

When we use a *so-*clause to connect a cause or reason to a result, the *so-*clause must come second:

- *I’m on a diet **so** I have stopped eating chocolate.*

:::

## Conjunctions: purpose

We use the following conjunctions to talk about purposes or goals. *So* and *so that* are more common than *so as* and *in order that*. *So as* is rather informal. *In order that* is more formal than the others.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>action</td><td>conjunction</td><td>purpose/goal</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I asked him to move</i></td><td><i>so</i><i>so that</i><i>so as</i><i>in order that</i> (formal)</td><td><i>I could see the screen better.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

We don’t usually put the subordinating clause first. When we do, it is more formal.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>conjunction</td><td>purpose/goal</td><td>action</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>So</i><i>So that</i><i>In order that</i></td><td><i>I could see the screen better,</i></td><td><i>I asked him to move.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>
