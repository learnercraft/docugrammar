# Conjunctions: contrasting

The conjunctions *but* and *although*/*though* connect ideas that contrast. *Whereas* is also used but it is not as common:

- *The new city hall is amazing **but** it’s going to cost a lot.*
- *He’s quite short, **whereas** his sister is tall.*

## But

*But* is a coordinating conjunction used to connect ideas that contrast. Coordinating conjunctions connect items which are the same grammatical type.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>main idea</td><td><br/></td><td>contrast</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>The meal was good</i><i>I want to lose weight</i><i>Lara cooked roast beef for me</i><i>Edinburgh is an interesting place</i></td><td><i>but</i></td><td><i>expensive.</i><i>I hate diets</i>.<i>I don’t eat meat</i>.<i>it takes a long time to get there</i>.</td></tr></tbody></table>

:::warning

We can’t use *however* as a conjunction instead of *but* to connect words and phrases:

- *My teacher is very nice **but** a bit strict.*
- Not: *~~My teacher is very nice however a bit strict.~~*

## Although/though

*Although/though* can be used to contrast ideas. *Although/though* are subordinating conjunctions used to connect a subordinate clause to a main clause, like *after, as, before, if, since, that, even though, even if*.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>main idea</td><td><i>although</i><i>though</i></td><td>contrast</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Grace is an excellent athlete</i></td><td><i>she injured her leg recently</i>.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Harry is a great friend</i></td><td><i>we don’t see each other often</i>.</td></tr></tbody></table>

The *although/though* clause can come first.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><br/></td><td>contrast</td><td>main idea</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Although</i></td><td><i>the car was destroyed,</i></td><td><i>no one was injured in the crash</i>.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Though</i></td><td><i>people say it’s dangerous</i>,</td><td><i>I think it’s an amazing country</i>.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## But or although?

*But* cannot be used in the same way as *although/though*. We use *but* to connect items which are the same grammatical type (coordinating conjunction).

:::warning

The order of clauses connected by coordinating conjunctions cannot be reversed:

- ***Although*** *it rained a lot, we’ve still enjoyed our holiday.*
- *We’ve still enjoyed our holiday, **although** it rained a lot.*
- *It rained a lot **but** we’ve still enjoyed our holiday.*
- Not: *~~But it rained a lot, we’ve still enjoyed our holiday.~~*

:::

*Although* can sound more formal than *but*. *Though* is much more common in speaking than in writing. *Although* is much more common in writing than in speaking.

## Even though, even if

*Even though* and *even if* are also used as subordinating conjunctions in the same way as *although/though. Even though* is similar to *although* but it makes a stronger contrast:

- ***Even though*** *I cycle to work, I don’t feel very fit.*

*Even if* means ‘whether or not’:

- ***Even if*** *you run, you’ll still be late.* (You’ll be late whether you run or not.)
- *I feel tired **even if** I go to bed early.* (I feel tired whether I go to bed early or not.)

- *Whether*

## Conjunctions: typical errors

We use *and* to connect words in a list and to connect phrases and clauses in a sentence:

- *He loves cycling, hiking **and** ball games.*
- Not: *~~He loves cycling, hiking, ball games.~~*

- *And*
- Adding with *and*

:::

After conjunctions referring to time, such as *when, once* and *as soon as*, we use the present simple when we refer to the future:

- *It will be summer **when we see** you again.*
- Not: … ~~when we will see you again.~~

- *They’ll leave **once the lecture finishes**.*
- Not: … ~~once the lecture will finish.~~

- ***As soon as I hear*** *any news, I’ll call you.*
- Not: *~~As soon as I’ll hear any news~~* …

*During* is a preposition, not a conjunction, so it must be followed by a noun or a pronoun:

- *She studies **while** she is on the train.*
- Not: *~~She studies during she is on the train.~~*

:::

When we use a *so-*clause to connect a cause/reason to a result, the *so-*clause must come second:

- *I bought a new computer game **so** I have no money left.*
- Not: *~~So I have no money left I bought a new computer game.~~*

:::

We use *although/though*, not *but*, to connect a subordinate clause to a main clause:

- ***Although*** *I’m tall, I’m not as tall as Bill.*
- Not: *~~But I’m tall, I’m not as tall as Bill.~~*

- *But* or *although?*

:::

When *as well as* or *in addition to* are followed by clauses, the verb is in the *\-ing* form:

- \[from a brochure advertising an English course in London\]
- ***As well as living*** *with a family, you practise your English.*
- Not: *~~As well as you live with a family~~* …

- ***In addition to being*** *a wonderful seafood restaurant, it had an amazing view.*
- Not: *~~In addition to it was a wonderful seafood restaurant~~* …

- Adding with *as well as* and *in addition to*

We cannot use *however* to connect words and phrases:

- *The area around Cannes has small **but** nice beaches.*
- Not: … ~~has small however nice beaches.~~

We only use one conjunction to connect words or phrases:

- Not: *~~Since she had the day off work, so she went out for lunch~~* …
