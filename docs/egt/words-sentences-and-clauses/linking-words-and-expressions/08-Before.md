# Before

*Before* is a preposition, an adverb and a conjunction. *Before* means earlier than the time or event mentioned:

- *Can you call me back **before** 5 pm, please?*
- *I met her just **before** she left.*

:::warning

In writing, when we refer back to something that we have already written, we use *above* not *before*:

- *As the graph **above** shows, the rate of inflation has risen by 15%.*

## Before as a preposition

We use *before* most commonly with noun phrases to refer to timed events:

- *I like to go for a run **before** breakfast.*
- *You can check in online but you have to do it at least four hours **before** your flight.*

We use *before* to refer to place, especially when it is seen as part of a journey or as part of a sequence of events in time:

- *Get off the bus just **before** Euston Station.*
- *Just **before** the end of the poem, there is a line where the poet expresses his deepest fears.*

## Before, by, till, until

If you have to do something *before* a certain point in time, then when that point arrives, the action must already be completed:

- *I need to have the letter* ***before Friday.*** (Friday is too late. I need it in advance of Friday.)

If you have to do something *by* a certain point in time, then that time is the last moment at which the action can be completed:

- *Can we finish this meeting **by 5 pm**. I have to get to the station **by 5.30 pm**.* (5 pm is the latest that I want the meeting to finish and 5.30 pm is the latest that I can arrive at the station.)

If something is done or happens *till* or *until* a point in time, it happens over a duration of time, starting before that time and continuing up to that point:

- \[out-of-office auto-reply message on an email\]
- *I’ll be out of the office **until 17th** May. I will reply to your email after that date.* (I will be back on 17 May, but not before.)

## Before as an adverb

*Before* often comes after nouns such as *day, morning, night, week, month, year* to refer to the previous day, morning, etc.:

- *Two people were ill at work yesterday and three people **the day before**!*
- A: *Did you graduate in 1989?*
- B: *No, actually, I finished college* ***the year before***.

When we refer to a period of time that is completed and goes from a point in the past up to now, we use *ago*, not *before*:

## Before as an adjunct

We use *before* to connect earlier events to the moment of speaking or to a point of time in the past:

- *I’m so looking forward to the trip. I haven’t been to Latin America **before**.* (up to the moment of speaking)
- *I introduced Tom to Olivia last night. They hadn’t met* ***before.*** (up to that point in the past)

## Before as a conjunction

We use *before* as a subordinating conjunction. We commonly use *before* with the past simple tense. It suggests that the second event happened soon after the first one. The *before* clause, which indicates the second action, can be at the end or at the beginning of the sentence:

- ***Before*** *she left, she gave everyone a present.*
- *She gave everyone a present **before** she left.*

### Before with present tenses

When we use *before* in clauses in the present tense, the clause can refer to the future:

- ***Before*** *I go to work, I jog for at least an hour.*
- Not: *~~Before I will go to work~~* …

### Before with past tenses

We sometimes use *before* clauses in a variety of tenses to say that the action or event in the *before* clause did not or may not happen:

- ***Before*** *I had a chance to thank him, he’d gone.*
- *You’re interrupting her **before** she has even spoken.*
- ***Before*** *he had finished his training, he was sacked.*
- *We should stop shopping now **before** we spend all our money.*

## Before with -ing

A non-finite clause with *before* + *ing*\-form is more formal:

- ***Before bringing*** *the milk to the boil, add the egg.* (more formal than *Before you bring* …)

## Just before, immediately before

We can use adverbs such as *just, immediately, shortly* and *long*, and expressions involving words such as *days, weeks, months, years* in front of *before*:

- *We got home **just before** it rained.*
- *The deadline for the essay was 5 pm. I got mine in **shortly before** five o’clock but Lily had hers in **days before** the deadline.*

## Beforehand

We can use *beforehand* as an alternative to *before* as an adverb, especially when the reference to time is less specific.

Spoken English:

*Beforehand* is more common in informal speaking than in writing:

- *I love singing but I always get so nervous **beforehand**.*

In front of *beforehand*, we can put adverbs such as *immediately, just* and *shortly*, and other time expressions such as *days, weeks, months, years*:

- ***Months beforehand****, Dominic had bought five tickets for the concert.*

We use *before* meaning ‘in front of’ in more formal contexts:

- *Brian was twenty years old. He had his whole life **before** him.*
- *The Prime Minister went **before** the people to tell them that he was going to resign.*

### Before long meaning ‘after a short time’

Especially in writing, we use *before long* to mean ‘after a short time’:

## Before: typical errors

We use *above* not *before* when we refer back to something we have already written:

- *As stated **above**, there are four key findings from the study.*
- Not: *~~As stated before, there are~~* …

When we refer to a period of time that is completed and which goes from a point in the past up to now, we use *ago*, not *before*:
