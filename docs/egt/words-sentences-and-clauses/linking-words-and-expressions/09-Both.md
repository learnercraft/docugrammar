# Both

We use *both* to refer to two things or people together:

- ***Both*** *those chairs are occupied, I’m afraid.* (The two chairs are occupied.)
- *Are **both** your parents going to Chile?* (Are your mother and father going to Chile?)

## Both with nouns

When we use *both* before a determiner (e.g. *a/an, the, she, his*) + noun, *both* and *both of* can be used:

- *She knew **both my children**.* (or … *both of my children*.)
- ***Both her brothers*** *are living in Canada.* (or *Both of her brothers …*)

We can use *both* before a noun:

- *This button starts **both engines** at the same time.* (or … *both of the engines …*)
- *Are* ***both cats female?***

## Both with pronouns

### Pronoun + both

We can use *both* after a subject pronoun or an object pronoun:

- ***We both*** *prefer classical music.*
- *Let’s open **them both** now.*

### Both of \+ object pronoun

When we use *both* as part of a subject or object which is a pronoun, it may be followed by *of* + an object pronoun:

- ***We both*** *dislike soap operas.* (subject pronoun + both) or ***Both*** ***of us*** *dislike soap operas*. (*both* + *of* + object pronoun)
- *She looked at **both of us**.*

We usually use *both of* + object pronoun after prepositions:

- *He shouted at **both of them**.* (preferred to *He shouted at them both*.)
- *That’ll be so nice **for both of you**.* (preferred to *That’ll be so nice for you both*.)

## Both as a pronoun

We can use *both* on its own as a pronoun:

- *There are two youth hostels in the city. **Both** are described as expensive, dirty, with poor lighting and poor security.*
- *Applicants for this course must speak French or German, preferably **both**.*

## Both: position

If *both* refers to the subject of a clause, we can use it in the normal mid position for adverbs, between the subject and main verb, after a modal verb or the first auxiliary verb, or after *be* as a main verb:

- *They **both wanted** to sell the house.* (between the subject and the main verb)
- *They **had both been refused** entry to the nightclub.* (after the first auxiliary or modal verb)
- *They **were both** very nice, kind and beautiful.* (after *be* as a main verb)
- Not: *~~They both were very nice~~* …

## Both in short answers

We use *both* on its own in short answers:

- A: *Would you like something to drink?*
- B: *A coffee and a tea, please*.
- A: ***Both****?*
- B: *Yeah, one for me and one for Brenda. She’s joining us in a minute*.
- A: *Are you working on Monday or Wednesday next week?*
- B: ***Both****!*
- Not: *~~The both.~~*

## Both of or neither of in negative clauses

We usually use *neither of* rather than *both of … not* in negative clauses:

- ***Neither of*** *them can swim.* (preferred to *Both of them can’t swim*.)
- ***Neither of*** *my brothers lives at home any more.* (preferred to *Both of my brothers don’t live at home any more*.)

When a negative verb is used, we use *either (of*). In informal speaking, we often use a plural verb after *either*, even though it is a singular word:

- *She didn’t like **either** dress.* (She looked at two dresses.)
- A: *Are Yvonne and Lesley **both** coming?*
- B: *We don’t know if **either** of them are coming*. (or, more formally, … *if either of them **is** coming*.)

- *Either*

## Both … and as a linking expression

We use *both* … *and* to emphasise the link between two things. This makes a stronger connection than *and* alone:

- ***Both*** *Britain **and** France agree on the treaty.*
- (stronger link than *Britain and France agree on the treaty.*)

- *She played **both** hockey **and** basketball when she was a student.*
- (stronger link than *She played hockey and basketball when she was a student.)*

## Both: typical errors

We don’t use *both* with a negative verb; we use *either* instead:

- *There was **not** a considerable difference in percentages for **either** sex in terms of having a Bachelor’s degree.*
- Not: *~~There was not a considerable difference in percentages for both sex in terms of having a bachelor’s degree.~~*

When we use the verb *be* as a main verb, *both* comes after the verb:

- *These films are **both** famous with people of all ages …*
- Not: *~~These films both are famous~~* …
