# But

*But* is a conjunction.

## But as a linking word

We use *but* to link items which are the same grammatical type (coordinating conjunction). *But* is used to connect ideas that contrast.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>main idea</td><td><i>but</i></td><td>contrast</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I love fruit</i><i>They’ve bought a house in Manchester</i></td><td><i>I am allergic to strawberries.</i><i>they still haven’t sold their house in London.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

The phrase *but not* is common:

- *The room has been painted **but not** in the colour that I asked for.*
- *I’d love to go for a pizza with you **but not** tonight.*

## But meaning ‘except’

*But* means ‘except’ when it is used after words such as *all*, *everything/nothing*, *everyone/no one*, *everybody/nobody*:

- *I arrived at the airport and realised that I’d brought **everything but** my passport!*
- ***Everyone but*** *Anna has checked in.*
- ***Nobody but*** *the receptionist was left in the lobby of the hotel.*

We use object pronouns after *but* (*me, you, him, us*, etc.) even in subject position:

- ***Everybody but me*** *has paid.*
- ***No one but him*** *would get a job like that.*

In formal situations, we can use subject pronouns after *but*:

- ***Everyone but she*** *knew how the drama was going to end.*

## But for \+ reason

*But for* is used to introduce the reason why something didn’t happen:

- ***But for*** *the traffic, I would have been here an hour ago.*
- (The traffic was very heavy – if it weren’t for the traffic, I’d have been here an hour ago.)
- *They would have been badly injured **but for** the fact that they were wearing seat belts.*
- (They were wearing seat belts – if it weren’t for the fact that they were wearing seat belts, they would have been badly injured.)

## All but meaning ‘almost completely’

- *His parents had **all but** given up hope of seeing him again.*
