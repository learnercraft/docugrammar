# Either … or…

*Either… or*… connects two choices:

- *I’ve saved some money to buy **either** \[choice 1\] a DVD player **or** \[choice 2\] an MP3 player.*

We use *either… or*… to connect items which are the same grammatical type, e.g. words, phrases, clauses:

- *We can **either** pre- **or** post-date the document. I don’t mind.* (connecting prefixes)
- *It’s **either** black **or** grey. I can’t remember.* (connecting words)
- *You can stay **either** with me **or** with Janet.* (connecting phrases)
- ***Either*** *I drive to the airport **or** I get a taxi.* (connecting clauses)

The opposite of *either… or*… is *neither… nor*…. We use it to make negative statements connecting items:

- *We got so wet. We had **neither** umbrellas **nor** raincoats with us!*
- ***Neither*** *our families **nor** our friends know that we are getting married!*
