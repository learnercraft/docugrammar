# In order to

*In order to* is a subordinating conjunction.

We use *in order to* with an infinitive form of a verb to express the purpose of something. It introduces a subordinate clause. It is more common in writing than in speaking:

\[main clause\] *Mrs Weaver had to work full-time* \[subordinate clause\] ***in order to*** *earn a living for herself and her family of five children.*

*We all need stress **in order to** achieve and do our best work.*

The negative of *in order to* is *in order not to*:

*They never parked the big van in front of the house **in order not to** upset the neighbours.*
