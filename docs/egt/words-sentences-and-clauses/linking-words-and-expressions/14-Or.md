# Or

*Or* is a conjunction that connects two or more possibilities or alternatives. It connects words, phrases and clauses which are the same grammatical type:

- *Which do you prefer? Leather **or** suede?*
- *You can have some freshly baked scones **or** some chocolate cake **or** both.*

We use *or* after the negative form of a verb, instead of *and*.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>I like tea </i><b><i>and</i></b><i> coffee.</i></td><td>I like both tea and coffee.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I don’t like tea </i><b><i>or</i></b><i> coffee.</i></td><td>I don’t like tea and I don’t like coffee.</td></tr></tbody></table>

When we connect two or more nouns using *or*, we use a singular verb with singular nouns, and a plural verb with plural countable nouns:

- *A banjo **or** a mandolin **is** what we need.* (singular nouns)
- *I think more pictures **or** ornaments **are** needed in this room.* (plural nouns)

## Either … or

For emphasis, we can use *either* … *or*:

- *You can pay **either** by cash **or** by credit card.* (the same as: *You can pay by cash or by credit card*.)

:::warning

The negative form of *either … or* is *neither … nor*:

- ***Neither*** *Joe **nor** Maria will be at the wedding.*

:::

In more formal language we sometimes use *nor* instead of *or*, even when *neither* is not used. It sometimes comes after a pause when someone adds another option:

- *No one knew from where they came – **nor** to where they went.*

## Typical errors

We use *or*, not *and*, after the negative form of a verb:

- *There weren’t any facilities at all. There were no bathrooms, telephones **or** even pillows.*
- Not: *~~There were no bathrooms, telephones and even pillows.~~*

We only use *or* to connect alternative possibilities. We use *and* when we mean ‘in addition to’:

- *In this essay, I will discuss both the advantages **and** disadvantages of killing animals for food.*
- Not: *~~I will discuss both the advantages or disadvantages~~* …

- *And*
