# While and whilst

## While or whilst?

*While* and *whilst* mean the same when we use them as conjunctions. They both mean ‘during the time that something else happens’, or ‘in contrast with something else’. *While* is much more common than *whilst*, and *whilst* sounds more formal:

- *Would you like something to eat **while** we’re waiting?*
- (less common: *… **whilst** we’re waiting?*)
- (during the time we’re waiting)

- *British English prefers an ‘s’ for words like realise, organise and industrialise, **while** American English prefers ‘z’ (realize, organize, industrialize).*
- (less common: *… **whilst** American English prefers ‘z’ …*)
- (expressing a contrast between British and American English)

## While or when?

*While* (or *whilst*) means ‘during the time when something else happens’. *When* can mean the same as *while*, but *when* can also refer to a point in time.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>during the time something happens</td><td>a point in time</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>The phone rang </i><b><i>while</i></b><i>/</i><b><i>when</i></b><i> we were having dinner.</i></td><td><b><i>When</i></b><i> the phone rang, she answered it immediately.</i>Not: <s>While the phone rang</s> …</td></tr></tbody></table>

## While as a noun

*A while* means ‘an unspecified period of time’:

- *We spent **a while** looking at the boats in the harbour before going for lunch.*
- *I haven’t seen Andrew for **a while**. I wonder if he’s okay.*
- *It’s **a** long **while** since anyone lived in that house – maybe ten years. It’s a ruin now.*

## Typical error

*While* does not mean the same as *when*:

- *Always keep some change with you. It’s useful **when** buying a bus ticket.*
- Not: … ~~while buying a bus ticket.~~
- ***When*** *I came home, I made some dinner then watched TV.*
- Not: *~~While I came home~~* …
