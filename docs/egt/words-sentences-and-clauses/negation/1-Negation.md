# Negation

When we want to say that something is not true or is not the case, we can use negative words, phrases or clauses. Negation can happen in a number of ways, most commonly, when we use a negative word such as *no*, *not, never, none*, *nobody*, etc:

- A: *Is there a bus at ten o’clock?*
- B: ***No***. *The last one goes at nine forty-five*. (*No* = There isn’t a bus at ten o’clock.)
- *Kieran does**n’t** play the piano.* (It is not true that Kieran plays the piano.)

The most common negative words are *no* and *not*. Other negative words include:

*neither, never, no one, nobody, none, nor, nothing, nowhere*:

- *She’s **never** been abroad.*
- *There were **no** newspapers left in the shop by one o’clock.*
- ***Nobody*** *came to the house for several days.*
- ***None*** *of my cousins live near us.*
- *Most children do**n’t** walk to school any more.*

- *Neither, neither … nor* and *not … either*
- *So am I*, *so do I*, *Neither do I*
- *Never* or *not … ever*?
- *No one*, *nobody*, *nothing*, *nowhere*
- *No*, *none* and *none of*
- *Not any* and *no*

:::

We can also make negative meanings using prefixes (e.g. *de*\-, *dis*\-, *un*\-) and suffixes (-*less*):

- *He was very **disrespectful** to the teacher.*
- *This new printer is **useless**; it’s always breaking down.*

We can also use the following words to make negative or negative-like statements:

- *few, hardly, little, rarely, scarcely, seldom*.
- *There are **rarely** ducks in this pond.*
- *We **seldom** hear any noise at night.*

:::note[See also]

- *Little*, *a little*, *few*, *a few*
- *Hardly*
- *Hardly ever*, *rarely*, *scarcely*, *seldom*
- *Scarcely*

:::

Negation is more common in spoken than in written language because negative forms can be used in face-to-face interactions to make what we say less direct:

- ***I’m not sure*** *if this is the right desk. I’m looking for information on the train times to Liverpool.* (less direct than *Is this the right desk?)*

## Forming negative statements, questions and imperatives

### Negative statements

We form negative statements with *not* or *n’t* after *be*, modal and auxiliary verbs. *n’t* is the contracted form of *not*. In informal language we can add *n’t*, without a space, to *be*, to modal verbs (except *may*) and to auxiliary verbs (*do* and *have*). The negative contracted form of *will* is *won’t*. The uncontracted form of *can* + *not* is *cannot*.

- *Jan **isn’t** coming. She’s not feeling very well.*
- *She **might not** be joking. It could be true.*
- *They **don’t** go to school on Wednesday afternoons.*
- *Living in a small flat **does not** make it easy to have pets.*
- *I **hadn’t** decided whether to take the train or go in the car.*
- *They **can’t** be hungry again. They’ve only just eaten.*

### Negative questions

We use *not* or *n’t* to form negative questions. When there is no modal verb or *be*, we use auxiliary verb *do* + *n’t* (*don’t, do not, doesn’t, does not, didn’t*):

- *Why **didn’t** you ask Linda?*
- *What **don’t** you understand?*
- ***Won’t*** *we able to see the film?*
- ***Isn’t*** *that Mike’s brother?*

### Negative imperatives

We use *do + not* or *don’t* + the base form of a verb to form negative orders or commands:

- ***Do not*** *open until instructed.*
- ***Don’t*** *take the car. Go on your bike.*

- Declarative clauses
- *Not* and *n’t* in questions (*Did you* *not* …? *Wasn’t she* …?)
- *Don’t, Do not*: orders and instructions
- *Let*’s, *let*: suggestions, offers, imperatives

## Negation: two negatives

Standard English does not have two negatives in the same clause (double negatives). Words such as *never, nobody, no one, none, nothing, nowhere*, etc. already have a negative meaning, so we don’t need another negative with the verb:

- *There was **no one** in the office so I left a message.*
- Not: *~~There wasn’t no one~~* …

- ***Nobody*** *likes to think they are worthless.*
- Not: *~~Nobody doesn’t like to think~~* …

If we use *not* with the verb, we use words such as *ever*, *anybody*, *anyone*, *anything*, *anywhere*, instead of *never*, *nobody*, *no* *one*, *nothing*, *nowhere*:

- *I **haven’t** seen Ken **anywhere** today. In fact I **don’t** think **anyone’s** seen him for the last couple of days.*
- Not: *~~I haven’t seen Ken nowhere~~ … or ~~I don’t think no one’s seen him~~* …

You may hear some speakers using two negatives in the same clause, but many people consider this to be incorrect.

### Not … I don’t think

There are some cases where we can use reporting verbs such as *imagine, suppose* and *think* in end position, after the reported clause. In such cases, both clauses may have a negative verb:

- *He’s **not** a teacher, I **don’t** think.* (or *I **don’t think** he’s a teacher*.)
- Not: *~~I don’t think he’s not a teacher.~~*

- *I **won’t** be very late tonight, I **shouldn’t** imagine.* (or *I **shouldn’t imagine** I’ll be very late tonight*.)
- Not: *~~I shouldn’t imagine I won’t be late.~~*

Sometimes we use *not* in front position where a following reduced clause (a clause with something omitted but which is understood) also has a negative form:

- A: *Have you seen Leila?*
- B: ***Not*** *today, I have****n’t***. (I haven’t seen Leila/her.)
- A: *Is Tony working at the university?*
- B: ***Not*** *now, he is****n’t***. *He used to*.

## Negative clauses with any, anybody, anyone, anything, anywhere

We don’t use not with *some*, *someone*, *somebody*, *something*, *somewhere* in statements. We use *any*, *anyone*, *anybody*, *anything*, *anywhere*:

- *There are**n’t*** ***any** seats left. You’ll have to stand.*
- Not: *~~There aren’t some seats left.~~*

- *Tell them I **don’t** want to see **anyone**.*
- Not: *~~Tell them I don’t want to see someone.~~*

After verbs with a negative meaning like *decline* or *refuse*, we use *anything* rather than *something*:

- *They refused to tell us **anything** about it.* (preferred to *They refused to tell us something about it*.)

:::note[See also]

- *Any*
- *Anyone*, *anybody* or *anything*?

## Negation in non-finite clauses

Non-finite clauses are clauses without a subject, where the main verb is in the *to*\-infinitive form, the -*ing* form or the *\-ed* form. To make the negative of a non-finite clause, we can use *not*.

Compare (non-finite clauses are underlined)

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>affirmative non-finite clause</td><td>negative non-finite clause</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>To have given up such a good job<i> would have been foolish.</i></td><td>Not to have invited James to our little party<i> would have been impolite.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Thinking of my own situation<i>, I decided it was time to talk to Dennis.</i></td><td><i>She left the house very quietly, </i>not wishing to alarm anyone<i>.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Cooked in a slow oven<i>, this dish is delicious with baked potatoes.</i></td><td>Not funded by any government grants<i>, the research team have to raise money from companies and individuals.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

In non-finite clauses with a *to*\-infinitive verb, we can use *not* after *to*. However, many speakers consider such ‘split infinitives’ (where something comes between *to* and the verb) to be bad style:

- ***To not realise*** *what was happening was stupid. She should have noticed something was wrong.* (or ***Not to realise*** *what was happening …*)
- *I was thinking it would be nice **to not have*** ***to** go out and just stay in and watch TV.* (or … *it would be nice **not to have*** ***to** go out …*)

## Negative prefixes and suffixes

We use these prefixes most commonly in negation: *de*\-, *dis*\-, *il*\-/*im*\-/*in*\-/*ir*\-, *mis*\-, *non*\-, *un*\-:

- *What he said was very **im**polite.*
- *There was a **mis**understanding about who should sign the contract.*
- *The refugees also need **non-**food items such as tents and blankets.* (items which are not food)

*\-less* is the most common suffix for negation:

- *Too many people are home**less** in this city.*
- *We just have end**less** meetings at work – they’re so boring.*

## Negative adverbs: hardly, seldom, etc

Some adverbs (e.g. *hardly*, *little*, *never*, *only*, *scarcely* and *seldom*) have a negative meaning. When we use these at the beginning of the clause, we invert the subject and verb:

- ***Hardly*** *had we left the hotel when it started to pour with rain.*
- Not: *~~Hardly we had left the hotel~~* …
- ***Little*** *did we know that we would never meet again.*
- ***Only*** *in spring do we see these lovely little flowers.*

We also invert the subject and verb after *not* + a prepositional phrase or *not* + a clause in front position:

- ***Not*** *for a moment did I think I would be offered the job, so I was amazed when I got it.*
- ***Not*** *till I got home did I realise my wallet was missing.*

## Negation: emphasising

When we want to emphasise something negative, we often use *at all*. We normally use *at all* immediately after the word or phrase we are emphasising:

- *There’s **nothing*** ***at all** left in the fridge.*
- *I’d rather **not** be here **at all**.*
- *We had **no** rain **at all** this summer and now we have floods!*

*Not at all* can come before an adjective:

- *She was **not at all** happy with the result.*

:::note[See also]

- *All*

:::

We can also use *whatsoever* for emphasis after *no +* noun, *nobody, no one, none* and *nothing*. Its meaning is similar to *at all*, but it is stronger. We can use *whatsoever* to add emphasis to any negative noun phrase:

- ***No*** *food or drink **whatsoever** must be brought into the classroom.*
- A: *Did any of her family go to the wedding?*
- B: *No*. ***None whatsoever***.

We can also use *not a bit*, *a little bit*, *one bit*, *in the least*, *the least bit* to emphasise negatives:

- *Setting off the alarm was supposed to be a joke but **no one** found it **one bit** funny.*
- *We suggested going to the cinema but they did**n’t** seem **the least bit** interested, so we just took them shopping instead.*

:::note[See also]

- *A bit*

:::

We often add emphasis to negation to make what we say more polite. When someone makes a request using the phrase *Do you mind if* or *Would you mind if*, instead of replying with *No* (I don’t mind) we often say *not at all* or *not in the least* when we reply:

- A: *Do you mind if I sit here?*
- B: ***Not at all***.
- A: *Would you mind if I check my emails on your computer?*
- B: ***Not in the least***.

When someone says *thanks* or *thank you*, we often reply *not at all*:

- A: *Thanks so much for lunch, Rachel*.
- B: ***Not at all***. *It was my pleasure*.

- Requests
- *Please* and *thank you*

## Negation of think, believe, suppose, hope

When we use verbs like *think, believe, suppose* (mental process verbs) to express uncertainty about something, we usually use *not* with the mental process verb rather than with the verb in the following clause:

- *I **don’t think** I’m going to pass my exams.* (preferred to *I think I’m not going to pass my exams*.)

:::

However, we don’t normally use a negative with *hope* and *wish*:

- *I **hope** I’m **not** going to fail.*
- Not: *~~I don’t hope I’m going to fail.~~*

- *I **wish** I had**n’t** sent that email to Joan.*
- Not: *~~I don’t wish I had sent~~* …

:::note[See also]

- *So* and *not* with *expect*, *hope*, *think*, etc.
- *No* or *not*?
- *Neither, neither … nor* and *not … either*
- *Not*
