# No one, nobody, nothing, nowhere

*No one*, *nobody*, *nothing* and *nowhere* are indefinite pronouns.

We use *no one, nobody, nothing* and *nowhere* to refer to an absence of people, things or places. We use them with a singular verb:

- ***Nobody*** *ever goes to see her. She’s very lonely.*
- *You usually have to wait for a long time. **Nothing** happens quickly.*
- *There was **nowhere** to park the car.*

We often use the plural pronoun *they* to refer back to (singular) *no one* or *nobody* when we do not know if the person is male or female:

- ***No one*** *remembers the titles of the books they’ve read.*

### No one or nobody?

*No one* and *nobody* mean the same. *Nobody* is a little less formal than *no one*. We use *no one* more than *nobody* in writing:

- *I knew **nobody** at the party.*
- ***No one*** *moved; **no one** said anything.*

We write *no one* as two separate words or with a hyphen: *no one* or *no-one* but not noone.

### Nobody or not … anybody, etc

*Nobody, no one, nothing, nowhere* are stronger and more definite than *not* … *anybody/anyone/anything/anywhere*:

- *I did **nothing**.* (stronger than *I didn’t do anything*.)
- *She told **no one**, not even her mother.* (stronger than *She didn’t tell anyone …*)

We don’t use *not* + *anyone/anything/anywhere* as the subject of a clause:

- ***Nothing*** *will make me change my mind.*
- Not: *~~Not anything will make me change my mind.~~*

We don’t use *nobody*, *no one, nothing, nowhere* after *no*, *not*, *never* or other words which have a negative meaning (*hardly*, *seldom*). We use *anyone, anybody, anything, anywhere*:

- *I ca**n’t** do **anything**.*
- Not: *~~I can’t do nothing.~~*
- *She talks to **hardly anyone**.*
- Not: *~~She talks to hardly no one.~~*
