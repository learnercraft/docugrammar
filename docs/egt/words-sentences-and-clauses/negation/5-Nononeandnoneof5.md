# No, none and none of

*No* and *none of* are determiners. *None* is a pronoun. *No*, *none* and *none* *of* indicate negation.

## No

We use *no* directly before nouns:

- *I’ve got **no** time to waste.*
- *There are **no** people I recognise here.*
- *She says she has **no** friends.*

## None

*None* is the pronoun form of *no*. *None* means ‘not one’ or ‘not any’. We use it as a pronoun to replace countable and uncountable nouns. We use it as subject or object:

- *Slorne stared … and seemed to try to find some strength which would let her speak. But **none** came*. (No strength came.)
- *My mother had two brothers. My father had **none**.* (My father didn’t have any brothers.)
- A: *What reasons did he give?*
- B: ***None***.

When *none* is the subject, the verb is either singular or plural depending on what it is referring to.

- *I’m always looking for inspiration. **None** ever **comes**.*
- *She’s always looking for ideas. **None** ever **come**.*

:::warning

We don’t use *none* where we mean *no one* or *nobody*:

- *They had a wonderful time and luckily **no one** was injured.*
- Not: … ~~and luckily none was injured.~~

:::

## None of

We use *none* with *of* before *the*, demonstratives (*this, that*), possessives (*my, your*) or pronouns:

- ***None*** ***of*** *his old friends knew what had happened to him.*
- *It doesn’t matter. **None of** it was your fault.*

We don’t use *none of* when there is already a negative word (*not, n’t*) in the clause:

- *She doesn’t remember **any*** ***of** us.*
- Not: *~~She doesn’t remember none of us~~*.

:::warning

When we are referring to two things or people, we use *neither of* rather than *none of*:

- *We sat down at the table, just the two of us. He carried on eating his food. **Neither of** us said anything.*
- Not: *~~None of us said anything.~~*

:::

In formal styles, we use *none of* with a singular verb when it is the subject. However, in informal speaking, people often use plural verbs:

- ***None of*** *that surprises me.*
- *Indeed, **none of** his novels is well shaped or well written.*
- ***None of*** *the products have been tested on animals and all the bottles are recyclable.* (informal)

## Typical error

We don’t use *none* directly before nouns. We use *no* + noun or *none of* + noun:

- ***No*** *children in my group caused any trouble.* (or ***None of*** *the children in my group …*)
- Not: *~~None children in my group~~* …

- *No* or *not*?
