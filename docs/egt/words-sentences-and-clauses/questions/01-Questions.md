# Questions

A question is anything we write or say which requires a response. In writing, questions are usually followed by a question mark:

- A: ***Where do you live?***
- B: *Near the station, number 41 Station Road, to be exact*.
- A: ***Would anyone like to go for lunch now?***
- B: *Yeah, me for sure*.
- C: *Me too*.

Typical question clauses are called interrogatives and the normal word order is auxiliary/modal verb (aux/mod) + subject (s) + main verb (v) + x, where x is any other element present (e.g. object/predicative complement):

- *\[AUX\] Do \[S\] you \[V\] like \[X\] my new hairstyle?*
- *\[MOD\] Must \[S\] you \[V\] make \[X\] that noise?*

Questions can be affirmative or negative:

- *Are you ready yet? Aren’t you ready yet?*
- *Why did you leave? Why didn’t you leave?*

In speaking, questions usually have a particular type of intonation that tells the listener that they are questions.

## Questions that don’t need an answer (rhetorical questions)

In speaking and writing, we sometimes ask questions which do not require a spoken or written response, but they usually require a mental response. The listener or reader thinks about the answer but does not say or write it; the speaker or writer answers the question in their mind. We often use these questions in academic lectures and texts:

- *Knowing taxation laws is important.* ***Why is that? These laws help us …***
- ***Why was Freud so influential? This is an interesting question which this essay will explore in detail.***
