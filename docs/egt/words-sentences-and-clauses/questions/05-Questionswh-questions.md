# Questions: wh-questions

*Wh-*questions begin with *what, when, where, who, whom, which*, *whose*, *why* and *how*. We use them to ask for information. The answer cannot be *yes* or *no*:

- A: ***When*** *do you finish college?*
- B: *Next year*.
- A: ***Who*** *is your favourite actor?*
- B: *George Clooney for sure!*

## Forming wh-questions

### With an auxiliary verb

We usually form *wh-*questions with *wh-* + an auxiliary verb (*be, do* or *have*) + subject + main verb or with *wh-* + a modal verb + subject + main verb:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>Be: When </i><b><i>are</i></b><i> you leaving?</i></td><td><i>Who</i><b><i>’s</i></b><i> </i><b><i>been</i></b><i> paying the bills?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Do: Where </i><b><i>do</i></b><i> they live?</i></td><td><i>Why </i><b><i>did</i></b><i>n’t you call me?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Have: What </i><b><i>has</i></b><i> she done now?</i></td><td><i>What </i><b><i>have</i></b><i> they decided?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Modal: Who </i><b><i>would</i></b><i> she stay with?</i></td><td><i>Where </i><b><i>should</i></b><i> I park?</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Without an auxiliary verb

:::warning

When *what, who, which* or *whose* is the subject or part of the subject, we do not use the auxiliary. We use the word order subject + verb:

- ***What*** *fell off the wall? **Which** horse won?*
- ***Who*** *bought this? **Whose** phone rang?*

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>Who owns this bag?</i></td><td><i>Who</i> is the subject of the sentence and <i>this bag</i> is the object. We use no auxiliary verb.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Who do you love most?</i></td><td><i>Who</i> is the object of the sentence and <i>you</i> is the subject. We use the auxiliary verb <i>do</i>.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Responding to wh-questions

*Wh-*questions ask for information and we do not expect a *yes*\-*no* answer to a *wh*\-question. We expect an answer which gives information:

- A: *Where’s the coffee machine?* (We expect an answer about the location of the coffee machine.)
- B: *It’s in the room next to the reception*.

- A: *How old is your dog?* (We expect an answer about the age of the dog.)
- B: *She’s about five. I’m not very sure*.

## Adding emphasis to wh-questions

We can add emphasis to *wh-*questions in speaking by stressing the auxiliary verb *do*. We usually do this when we have not already received the information that we expected from an earlier question, or to show strong interest.

When the *wh*\-word is the object of the sentence, the *do* auxiliary is stressed to make it more emphatic:

- A: *How was your weekend in Edinburgh?*
- B: *I didn’t go to Edinburgh*.
- A: *Really. Where **did** you go?*
- B: *We decided to go to Glasgow instead*.

When the *wh-*word is the subject of the sentence, we can add the auxiliary *do* to make it emphatic. We stress *do*:

- A: *Ronald Price lives in that house, doesn’t he?*
- B: *No. He moved out*.
- A: *So who **does** live there?* (non-emphatic question: *So who lives there?*)
- B: *Actually, his son is living there now*.

## Negative wh-questions

When we ask negative *wh-*questions, we use the auxiliary verb *do* when there is no other auxiliary or modal verb, even when the *wh-*word is the subject of the clause:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>Affirmative with no auxiliary</td><td>Negative with auxiliary <b><i>do</i></b></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>Who</i></b><i> wants an ice cream?</i></td><td><b><i>Who doesn’t</i></b><i> want an ice cream?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>Which</i></b><i> door opened?</i></td><td><b><i>Which door didn’t</i></b><i> open?</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Adding a wh-word at the end of a statement to make a question

Spoken English:

In speaking, we can sometimes turn *wh-*questions into statement questions:

- *What’s today’s date? or Today’s date is what?*

We do this especially when we are checking information that we have already been given or when we want to quickly check a particular detail. These are less formal than full *wh*\-questions:

- A: *So we’re all going to be there at eight?*
- B: *Right, I’m travelling with Larry*.
- A: ***You’re travelling with who?*** (more formal: *Who are you travelling with?*)
- B: *With Larry. We’re actually going on our bikes*.

- A: *Is your sister here too or just your mother?*
- B: *Just my mother*.
- A: ***And she’s here until when?*** (more formal: *And when is she here until?* or even more formal: *Until when is she here?*)

## Intonation and wh-questions

The intonation of *wh-*questions is normally falling. The falling intonation is on the most important syllable:

- *Where are the keys to the back **do***↘***or**?*
- *Why are the lights **re***↘***d**?*

When we ask *wh-*questions to check or clarify information that has already been given, we may use rising or fall-rising intonation:

- ***Wh***↗***at*** *did you say the time was?* (I know you’ve told me before but I’ve forgotten.)
- ***Wh***↘***o*** *p*↗*aid for the meal?*

## Prepositions and particles with wh-questions

We can use *wh-*words and phrases after prepositions in more formal questions:

- ***Where*** *will the money come **from**?*
- ***From*** ***where*** *will the money come?* (formal)

Spoken English:

In informal styles, especially in speaking, the preposition may be separated and placed at the end of the question clause:

- ***What*** *will I talk to her **about**?*
- ***Who*** *should we send the invitation **to**?* (informal)
- ***Whom*** *should we send the invitation **to**?* (formal)
- ***To whom*** *should we send the invitation?* (more formal)
- ***For what reason*** *did she leave him?* (formal: preposition + *wh*\-phrase)

When we make questions shorter, we usually put the preposition and its complement together:

- A: *We’re all meeting up tonight*.
- B: ***At what*** *time?*
- Not: *~~What time at?~~*

- Questions: short forms

:::

When we ask questions using verbs consisting of a main verb + particle, e.g. *get up, set out* (phrasal verbs), we do not separate the verb from the particle or preposition:

- *When did you **wake up** this morning?*
- Not: *~~Up when did you wake?~~*
