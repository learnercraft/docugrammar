# Questions: yes-no questions (Are you feeling cold?)

Questions that need either a *yes* or a *no* answer are called *yes-no* questions:

- *Do you like vanilla ice cream?* (answer: *yes* or *no*)
- *Have you ever seen a ghost?* (answer: *yes* or *no*)

## Forming yes-no questions

### With an auxiliary verb

We form *yes-no* questions with an auxiliary verb (*be, do* or *have*) + subject + main verb or with a modal verb + subject + main verb:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>Be: </i><b><i>Is</i></b><i> she working very hard?</i></td><td><b><i>Were</i></b><i> they travelling together?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Do: </i><b><i>Does</i></b><i> that taste okay?</i></td><td><b><i>Did</i></b><i> you go to the concert?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Have: </i><b><i>Have</i></b><i> they eaten yet?</i></td><td><b><i>Had</i></b><i> they visited Rome before?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Modal: </i><b><i>Could</i></b><i> you help me lift this?</i></td><td><b><i>Should</i></b><i> I open the window?</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

Where there is no auxiliary verb *be*, *have* or modal verb already present in the statement, we use the auxiliary *do, does, did*:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>Statement form (no auxiliary)</td><td>Question form</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>You usually walk to work</i>.</td><td><b><i>Do</i></b> <i>you usually walk to work?</i>Not: <s>Walk you…?</s></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>You liked disco music in the 70s</i>.</td><td><b><i>Did</i></b> <i>you like disco music in the 70s?</i>Not: <s>Liked you…?</s></td></tr></tbody></table>

We don’t use an auxiliary verb when we use *be* as a main verb:

- ***Is she*** *your sister?*
- Not: *~~Does she be your sister?~~*

:::warning

When there is more than one auxiliary verb or a modal verb plus auxiliary verb(s), we only put the first auxiliary or the modal verb before the subject and the others after the subject:

:::

Auxiliary + subject + auxiliary + verb

- ***Is*** *this phone call **being** recorded?*
- Not: *~~Is being this phone call recorded?~~ or ~~Is being recorded this phone call?~~*

Auxiliary + subject + auxiliary + verb

- ***Has*** *the garden **been** looked after while you were away?*
- Not: *~~Has been the garden looked after while you were away?~~ or ~~Has been looked after the garden while you were away?~~*

Modal + subject + auxiliary + auxiliary + verb

- ***Should*** *we **have** been writing this down?*
- Not: *~~Should have we been writing this down?~~*

We only put auxiliary and modal verbs, not main verbs, before the subject:

- *Where **did** you find the keys?*
- Not: *~~Where did find you the keys?~~*

- *Be*
- *Have*

### Without an auxiliary verb

When we ask *yes-no* questions using the main verb *be*, we don’t use an auxiliary verb. The word order is: *be* + subject:

- ***Is the weather*** *nice in Turkey in the winter?*
- ***Was she*** *angry when you told her about the accident?*

When we ask *yes-no* questions with the main verb *have*, we can also use the word order verb + subject, but it sounds rather formal. We use *have got* and *do* as more neutral or informal alternatives:

- ***Have*** *you an identity card?* (formal)
- ***Do*** *you **have** an identity card?* (neutral)
- ***Have*** *you **got** an identity card?* (informal)

:::warning

When we ask questions with the main verb *have* in the past to refer to possession, we use *did … have* rather than *had … got*:

- ***Did*** *you **have** your glasses with you when you left the car?*
- ***Had*** *you **got** your glasses with you when you left the car?* (less common)

## Responding to yes-no questions

Other ways of saying *yes* and *no* include *yeah, yep, mm, okay*, and *nah, nope*. These are informal:

- A: *Would you like to play tennis with me later?*
- B: ***Okay***. (meaning *yes*)
- A: *Have you seen Greg?*
- B: ***Nope***. (meaning *no*)

We can also give more than just a *yes* or *no* answer. We sometimes add more information:

- A: *Can I grow potatoes in a pot?*
- B: *Yeah. They grow really well in pots*.
- A: *Will you be going to Ryan’s party?*
- B: *No. I’m actually going to be away on Friday night*.

Sometimes we don’t use *yes* or *no* as a reply but the answer that we give means *yes* or *no*:

- A: *Do you know Tina Gomez?*
- B: *We’ve known each other for years. We went to the same school*. (meaning *yes*)
- A: *Do you have the Thrills latest album?*
- B: *I’m afraid we’ve just sold the last one!* (meaning *no*)

We sometimes respond using the auxiliary verb from the question instead of *yes* and *no*:

- A: *Hey Tim, did you go fishing today?*
- B: *I* ***did***. *I went with the boys*.
- A: *Has Jason had breakfast?*
- B: *He* ***hasn’t***. *He’s still in bed*.

## Negative yes-no questions

We usually use negative *yes-no* questions to check or confirm something we believe or expect to be the case, or when we consider that something is the best thing to do:

- ***Isn’t*** *that Pauline’s car?* (I’m pretty sure that this is correct. I’m asking for confirmation.)
- ***Shouldn’t*** *we be leaving?* (I think that we should leave now.)

We form negative *yes-no* questions with *not*. We usually use the contraction *n’t*. If we use *not* in its full form, the question sounds very formal:

- *Is**n’t** that the oldest building on this street?*

:::warning

When using the full form *not*, the order auxiliary + subject (s) + *not* is more common than auxiliary + *not* + subject:

- *\[AUX\] Is \[s\] that \[not\] **not** the oldest building in this street?* (formal) (preferred to \[the very formal\] *Is **not** that* *the oldest building on this street?*)

:::

We can use negative *yes-no* questions to make invitations, offers and complaints stronger:

- ***Won’t*** *you stay for dinner?* (invitation; stronger than *Will you stay for dinner*?)
- ***Wouldn’t*** *you like another coffee?* (offer; stronger than *Would you like another coffee?*)
- ***Can’t*** *the manager do something about the noise?* (complaint; stronger than *Can the manager do something about the noise?*)

## Intonation and yes-no questions

The intonation of *yes-no* questions is normally either rising \[↗ rising arrow\] or fall-rising \[↘ ↗ down up arrow\] intonation depending on the meaning. If we do not know the answer, we use rising intonation. If we more or less know the answer and are looking for confirmation, we use fall-rising intonation:

- *Are you* *w*↗*arm enough?*
- *Did you once* *li*↘*ve in* *Ir*↗*eland?* (I think the answer is *yes*.)

We often use fall-rising intonation with *yes-no* questions when asking a number of questions together:

- A: *You’re living i*↘*n B*↗*ayswater?* \[Question 1\]
- B: *Yeah. That’s right*.

- A: *Are you rentin*↘*g you*↗*r house?* \[Question 2\]
- B: *Yeah, we are*.

- A: *Is it exp*↘*ensi*↗*ve?* \[Question 3\]
- B: *It’s not very expensive for somewhere so near the city centre*.
