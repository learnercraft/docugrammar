# Which

*Which* is a *wh*\-word. We use *which* to ask questions and to introduce relative clauses.

## Which as a question word

We use *which* in questions as a determiner and interrogative pronoun to ask for specific information:

- *‘**Which** car are we going in?’ he asked Alexander.*
- ***Which*** *museums did you visit?*
- ***Which*** *do you prefer? Lemon cake or carrot cake?*

We use *which* in indirect questions and statements:

- *In the Young Cook of Britain competition, the finalists were asked **which** famous person they would like to cook for.*
- *Find out **which** way they’re going and we’ll follow.*

### Which or what?

We use both *which* and *what* to ask questions. We use *which* when there is a restricted range of answers. We use *what* more commonly when the range of answers is not restricted:

- ***Which*** *is the capital of Liberia? Monrovia or Greenville?*
- ***What****’s the capital of Liberia?*

## Which in relative clauses

We use *which* in relative clauses to refer to animals and to things:

- *We have seen a lot of changes **which** are good for business.*
- *The cruise ship, **which** will depart from Liverpool for a fifteen-night Mediterranean cruise, returns to the Mersey on 29 September.*

We also use *which* to introduce a relative clause when it refers to a whole clause or sentence:

- *She seemed more talkative than usual, **which** was because she was nervous.*
- *People think I sit around drinking coffee all day. **Which**, of course, I do.*

We often use *which* with prepositions. Some formal styles prefer to use a preposition before *which* rather than to leave the preposition ‘hanging’ at the end of the sentence:

- *There are several small ponds **in which** a variety of fish live.* (or *There are several small ponds **which** a variety of fish live* ***in***.)

## Which \+ of

We use *of* with *which* before other determiners (*the, those, your*) and pronouns (*yours, them*):

- ***Which of*** *the following features do you feel are important when choosing a house?*
- ***Which of*** *your sisters lives in Boston?*
- *There are a lot of high-street retailers. **Which of** them are offering the best value for money?*
