# Relative pronouns

Relative pronouns introduce relative clauses. The most common relative pronouns are *who, whom, whose, which, that*. The relative pronoun we use depends on what we are referring to and the type of relative clause.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>who</i></td><td>people and sometimes pet animals</td><td>defining and non-defining</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>which</i></td><td>animals and things</td><td>defining and non-defining; clause referring to a whole sentence</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>that</i></td><td>people, animals and things; informal</td><td>defining only</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>whose</i></td><td>possessive meaning;for people and animals usually; sometimes for things in formal situations</td><td>defining and non-defining</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>whom</i></td><td>people in formal styles or in writing; often with a preposition; rarely in conversation; used instead of <i>who</i> if <i>who</i> is the object</td><td>defining and non-defining</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>no relative pronoun</td><td>when the relative pronoun defines the object of the clause</td><td>defining only</td></tr></tbody></table>

(In the examples, the relative pronoun is in brackets to show where it is not essential; the person or thing being referred to is underlined.)

- *We don’t know* the person ***who*** *donated this money.*
- *We drove past* my old school*, **which** is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year.*
- *He went to* the school *(**that**) my father went to.*
- The Kingfisher group*, **whose** name was changed from Woolworths earlier this year, includes about 720 high street shops.* Superdrug*, **which** last week announced that it is buying Medicare, is also part of the group.*
- The parents *(**whom/who/that**) we interviewed were all involved in education in some way.*

## Relative pronouns: who

We use *who* in relative clauses to refer to people, and sometimes to pet animals. We use it to introduce defining and non-defining relative clauses:

- *I think there’d be a lot of* children ***who****’d love to have a climbing wall in school.* (defining)
- *That’s* the dog ***who*** *doesn’t like me.* (defining; referring to a pet animal)
- *There’s* this guy at work*, **who**’s one of my friends, well he’s never been on a train.* (non-defining)

### Subjects and objects

*Who* can act as the subject or the object of the relative clause:

- *She’s going out with* a bloke ***who****’s in the army.* (*who* refers to a *bloke* and is the subject of *is* in the relative clause; *bloke* is an informal word for a man)
- The woman ***who*** *I saw yesterday was Sheila.* (*who* refers to *the woman* and is the object of *saw* in the relative clause)

### Who \+ prepositions

We can use *who* as the complement of a preposition:

- *It was* Cath ***who*** *Ian gave the keys to. It wasn’t me.* (*who* refers to *Cath* and is the complement of the preposition *to*)

We put the preposition at the end of the relative clause, and not immediately before *who*:

- *Of all my friends, she’s* the one ***who*** *I know I can rely on.*
- Not: … ~~the one on who I know I can rely.~~

### Who with collective groups of people

We often use *who* with collective human nouns (e.g. *committee*, *government*, *group*, *panel*, *police*, *team*):

- *Nicola phoned* the fire brigade*, **who** then alerted the police and social workers.*

We do not use *who* for things:

- *There are* some very good art books ***which*** *you can get ideas from.*
- Not: *~~There are some very good art books who you can get ideas from.~~*

## Relative pronouns: whom

:::warning

We use *whom* in formal styles or in writing to refer to people when the person is the object of the verb. It is much more common in writing than in speaking:

- *The response of those* managers ***whom*** *I have consulted has been very positive and we are looking forward to meeting together.* (*whom* refers to *those managers* and is the object of *consulted* in the relative clause)
- *She was* a celebrated actress ***whom*** *he had known and loved, on and off, almost since her first appearance on the stage.*

:::

### Whom \+ prepositions

The most common use of *whom* is with a preposition. We can use *whom* as the complement of a preposition:

- *The first book was a terrible historical novel for children which was turned down by* every publisher ***to whom*** *it was sent.* (*whom* refers to *every publisher* and is the complement of the preposition *to*)
- *Drama in schools is particularly good for* pupils ***for whom*** *English is a second language.*

We put the preposition before *whom*.

## Relative pronoun: whose

We usually use *whose* as a relative pronoun to indicate possession by people and animals. In more formal styles we can also use it for things.

We use *whose* before nouns instead of a possessive expression (*my, your, his, her, its, our, their, x’s*) in defining and non-defining clauses:

- *He’s marrying* a girl ***whose*** *family don’t seem to like him.* (The family of the girl he’s marrying don’t seem to like him.)
- *There was me and there was* Kate*, **whose** party it was, and then there were two other people.* (It was Kate’s party.)
- *It is a rambling Tudor* house*, **whose** sitting room looks out over a wonderful walled garden.* (The sitting room of the house looks out over …)

### Whose \+ prepositions

We can use *whose* + noun as the complement of a preposition:

- Kate*, **whose** sister I used to shared a house with, has gone to work in Australia.* (*whose sister* refers to *Kate* and is the complement of *with*)

We can put the preposition immediately before the relative pronoun (more formal written styles) or at the end of the relative clause (more informal).

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>more formal</td><td>more informal</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Thomas Goldney III<i>, </i><b><i>in whose</i></b><i> house and garden several generations of Bristol students have now lived, was described in the late 18th century as ‘a very curious gentleman’.</i></td><td>Thomas Goldney III<i>, </i><b><i>whose</i></b><i> house and garden several generations of Bristol students have now lived </i><b><i>in</i></b><i>, was described in the late 18th century as ‘a very curious gentleman’.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Relative pronouns: which

We use *which* in relative clauses to refer to animals and to things. We use it to introduce defining and non-defining relative clauses. We always use *which* to introduce relative clauses when they refer to a whole sentence or clause:

- *You need to tick* the box ***which*** *says yes.* (defining)
- *He won’t have much time to prepare for* the meeting*, **which** is this afternoon.* (non-defining)
- She had to get up and walk all the way to the other side of the room*, **which** isn’t easy with a bad back.* (*which* refers to the whole sentence before it)

We use *which* or *that*, not *what*:

- *Another* activity ***which****/**that** I have chosen is photography.*
- Not: *~~Another activity what I have chosen is photography.~~*

### Subjects and objects

*Which* can act as the subject or the object of the relative clause:

- The new sports complex*, **which** will be built on the site of the old power station, will provide facilities for cricket, soccer, bowls and badminton.* (*which* refers to *the new sports complex* and is the subject of *will be built* in the relative clause)
- *It was* the same picture ***which*** *I saw at the National Gallery.* (*which* refers to *the same picture* and is the object of *saw* in the relative clause)

### Which \+ prepositions

We can use *which* as the complement of a preposition:

- *Early in the Autumn Term there is* a reception ***at which*** *you can meet current staff and students.* (*which* refers to *a reception* and is the complement of *at*)
- *Close by, in the churchyard, is* the famous Rudston stone*, **from which** the village takes its name.* (*which* refers to *the famous Rudston stone* and is the complement of *from*)

We can put the preposition immediately before the relative pronoun (more formal) or at the end of the relative clause (more informal).

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>more formal</td><td>more informal</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>The title of the poem indicates that the poet knows himself to be separated from </i>the community<i> </i><b><i>in</i></b><i> </i><b><i>which</i></b><i> he grew up.</i></td><td><i>I’ve never felt close to </i>the community<i> </i><b><i>which</i></b><i> I grew up </i><b><i>in</i></b><i>.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Which referring to a whole sentence

Relative clauses referring to a whole sentence are always introduced by *which*:

- There’s going to be a new headteacher in September*, **which** is good. It’s time for a change.*
- \[talking about a playschool for young children\]
- A: *It’s lovely and clean there, and there are lots of toys that he can play with and* he’s so happy*.*
- B: ***Which*** *is much more important*.

## Relative pronouns: that

We use *that* instead of *who, whom* or *which* in relative clauses to refer to people, animals and things. We use it to introduce defining clauses only. *That* is more informal than *who, whom* or *which*:

- *We met* somebody *last night **that** did the speech therapy course two years after you.* (refers to a person)
- *The 8.30 is* the train ***that*** *you need to get.* (refers to a thing)
- *She blamed herself for* everything ***that*** *had happened.*

### Subjects and objects

*That* can act as the subject or the object of the relative clause:

- *He finally remembers one lesson **that** his mum had taught him early – Don’t take* money ***that*** *doesn’t belong to you.* (*that* refers to *money* and is the subject of *belong* in the relative clause)
- *It’s* the same cooker ***that*** *my mother has.* (*that* refers to *the same cooker* and is the object of *has* in the relative clause)

### That after superlatives

We often use *that* after superlatives:

- *The Wimbledon men’s final was* the best game of tennis ***that*** *I’ve ever seen.*

### That \+ prepositions

*That* can refer to the complement of a preposition:

- *We’ve got* some tennis balls ***that*** *you can play **with**.* (*that* refers to *some tennis balls* and is the complement of the preposition *with*)

:::warning

Unlike *which, whom* and *whose*, we can’t use *that* with the preposition immediately before it:

- Not: *~~We’ve got some tennis balls with that you can play.~~*

## No relative pronoun

In informal styles, we often leave out the relative pronoun. We only do this in defining relative clauses, and when the relative pronoun is the object of the verb. We don’t leave out the relative pronoun when it is the subject of the verb nor in non-defining relative clauses:

- *German is* a language ***which*** *I’ve found hard to learn.* (or *German is a language I’ve found hard to learn*.) (defining relative clause: *which* is the object)
- *She’s* the singer ***who*** *I heard on the radio.* (or *She’s the singer I heard on the radio*.) (defining relative clause: *who* is the object)
- *There’s* a hill ***which begins three miles after the start of the race.*** (defining relative clause: *which* is the subject)
- Not: *~~There’s a hill begins three miles after the start of the race~~*.
- Sir James*, **whose** birthday is on February 26, plans to lay on a big party.* (non-defining relative clause)

:::

### No relative pronoun + preposition

In defining relative clauses, we can also leave out the relative pronoun when it is the complement of a preposition. When we do this, we always put the preposition at the end of the relative clause:

- *She was at* the garden party ***which*** *I was telling you **about**.* (or *She was at* the garden party ***about which*** *I was telling you*. or *She was at* the garden party *I was telling you* ***about***.) (defining relative clause: *which* is the complement of *about*)

## Relative pronouns: when, where and why

In informal language, we often use *where*, *when* or *why* to introduce defining relative clauses instead of *at which*, *on which* or *for which*.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>where</i></td><td>places</td><td><i>I know </i>a restaurant<i> </i><b><i>where</i></b><i> the food is excellent.</i>(… <i>a restaurant at which the food is excellent</i>)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>when</i></td><td>times</td><td><i>There isn’t </i>a day<i> </i><b><i>when</i></b><i> I don’t feel rushed off my feet.</i>(<i>… a day on which I don’t feel rushed …</i>)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>why</i></td><td>reasons</td><td><i>Do you know </i>the reason<i> </i><b><i>why</i></b><i> the shop is closed today?</i>(<i>… the reason for which the shop is closed …</i>)</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Relative pronouns: typical errors

We can’t use *that* instead of *who, whom* or *which* in non-defining relative clauses:

- *It gives me a good chance to improve my Italian, **which** has become a little bit rusty.*
- Not: *~~It gives me a good chance to improve my Italian, that has become a little bit rusty.~~*

We don’t use *what* as a relative pronoun:

- *So, he can make himself easily understood in the two languages, **which** helps a lot.*
- Not: *~~So, he can make himself easily understood in the two languages, what helps a lot.~~*

We don’t use *who* for things:

- *She’s written* some great cookery books ***which*** *have got pictures of delicious-looking recipes.*
- Not: *~~She’s written some great cookery books who have got pictures of delicious-looking recipes.~~*

Take care to spell *which* correctly: not ‘wich’.
