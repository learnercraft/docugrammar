# Reported speech: indirect speech

Indirect speech focuses more on the content of what someone said rather than their exact words. In indirect speech, the structure of the reported clause depends on whether the speaker is reporting a statement, a question or a command.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><br/></td><td>direct</td><td>indirect</td><td>reported clause</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>statement</td><td><i>‘I’m tired,’ I said.</i></td><td><i>I told them (</i><b><i>that</i></b><i>) </i><b><i>I</i></b><i> </i><b><i>was tired</i></b><i>.</i></td><td><i>that</i>-clause</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>question</td><td><i>‘Are you ready?’ the nurse asked Joel.</i><i>‘Who are you?’ she asked.</i></td><td><i>The nurse asked Joel </i><b><i>if/whether he was ready</i></b><i>.</i><i>She asked me </i><b><i>who I was</i></b><i>.</i></td><td><i>if-</i>clause<i>/whether-</i>clause<i>wh-</i>clause</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>command</td><td><i>‘Leave at once!’ they ordered.</i></td><td><i>They ordered us </i><b><i>to leave at once</i></b><i>.</i></td><td><i>to</i>-infinitive clause</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Indirect speech: reporting statements

Indirect reports of statements consist of a reporting clause and a *that*\-clause. We often omit *that*, especially in informal situations:

- *The pilot commented **that** the weather had been extremely bad as the plane came in to land.* (The pilot’s words were: *‘The weather was extremely bad as the plane came in to land.’*)
- *I told my wife I didn’t want a party on my 50th birthday.* (*that*\-clause without *that*) (or *I told my wife that I didn’t want a party on my 50th birthday*.)

## Indirect speech: reporting questions

### Reporting yes-no questions and alternative questions

Indirect reports of *yes-no* questions and questions with *or* consist of a reporting clause and a reported clause introduced by *if* or *whether*. *If* is more common than *whether*. The reported clause is in statement form (subject + verb), not question form:

- *She asked **if** \[S\] I \[V\] was Scottish.* (original *yes-no* question: *‘Are you Scottish?’*)
- *The waiter asked **whether** \[S\] we \[V\] wanted a table near the window.* (original *yes-no* question: *‘Do you want a table near the window?*)
- *He asked me **if** \[S\] I \[V\] had come by train or by bus.* (original alternative question: *‘Did you come by train or by bus?’*)

- Questions: *yes-no* questions (*Are you feeling cold?*)
- *Whether*

:::

### Reporting wh\-questions

Indirect reports of *wh*\-questions consist of a reporting clause, and a reported clause beginning with a *wh*\-word (*who, what, when, where, why, how*). We don’t use a question mark:

- *He asked me **what** I wanted.*
- Not: *~~He asked me what I wanted?~~*

The reported clause is in statement form (subject + verb), not question form:

- *She wanted to know who \[S\] **we** \[V\] **had** invited to the party.*
- Not: … ~~who had we invited~~ …

### Who, whom and what

In indirect questions with *who, whom* and *what*, the *wh-*word may be the subject or the object of the reported clause:

- *I asked them **who** came to meet them at the airport.* (*who* is the subject of *came*; original question: *‘Who came to meet you at the airport?’*)
- *He wondered **what** the repairs would cost.* (*what* is the object of *cost*; original question: *‘What will the repairs cost?’*)

The reported clause is in statement form (subject + verb), not question form:

- *She asked us **what** \[S\] **we** \[V\] **were doing**.* (original question: *‘What are you doing?’*)
- Not: *~~She asked us what were we doing?~~*

:::note[See also]

- *Whom*

:::

### When, where, why and how

We also use statement word order (subject + verb) with *when*, *where, why* and *how*:

- *I asked her **when** \[S\] **it** \[V\]* ***had happened*** (original question: *‘When did it happen?’*).
- Not: *~~I asked her when had it happened?~~*

- *I asked her **where** \[S\] **the bus station** \[V\] **was**.* (original question: *‘Where is the bus station?’*)
- Not: *~~I asked her where was the bus station?~~*

- *The teacher asked them **how** \[S\] **they** \[V\] **wanted*** ***to do the activity**.* (original question: *‘How do you want to do the activity?’*)
- Not: *~~The teacher asked them how did they want to do the activity?~~*

- Questions: *wh-*questions

## Indirect speech: reporting commands

Indirect reports of commands consist of a reporting clause, and a reported clause beginning with a *to*\-infinitive:

- *The General ordered the troops **to advance**.* (original command: *‘Advance!’*)
- *The chairperson told him **to sit down** and **to stop interrupting**.* (original command: *‘Sit down and stop interrupting!’*)

We also use a *to*\-infinitive clause in indirect reports with other verbs that mean wanting or getting people to do something, for example, *advise, encourage, warn*:

- *They advised me **to wait** till the following day.* (original statement: *‘You should wait till the following day.’*)
- *The guard warned us **not to enter** the area.* (original statement: *‘You must not enter the area.’*)

- Verbs followed by a *to*\-infinitive

## Indirect speech: present simple reporting verb

We can use the reporting verb in the present simple in indirect speech if the original words are still true or relevant at the time of reporting, or if the report is of something someone often says or repeats:

- *Sheila **says** they’re closing the motorway tomorrow for repairs.*
- *Henry **tells** me he’s thinking of getting married next year.*
- *Rupert **says** dogs shouldn’t be allowed on the beach.* (Rupert probably often repeats this statement.)

### Newspaper headlines

We often use the present simple in newspaper headlines. It makes the reported speech more dramatic:

- *JUDGE **TELLS** REPORTER TO LEAVE COURTROOM*
- *PRIME MINISTER **SAYS** FAMILIES ARE TOP PRIORITY IN TAX REFORM*

- Present simple (*I work*)
- Reported speech

## Indirect speech: past continuous reporting verb

In indirect speech, we can use the past continuous form of the reporting verb (usually *say* or *tell*). This happens mostly in conversation, when the speaker wants to focus on the content of the report, usually because it is interesting news or important information, or because it is a new topic in the conversation:

- *Rory **was telling** me the big cinema in James Street is going to close down. Is that true?*
- *Alex **was saying** that book sales have gone up a lot this year thanks to the Internet.*

## Backshift

‘Backshift’ refers to the changes we make to the original verbs in indirect speech because time has passed between the moment of speaking and the time of the report.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>direct speech</td><td>indirect speech</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I said, ‘I</i><b><i>’m</i></b><i> </i><b><i>not</i></b><i> very happy at work.’</i></td><td><i>I told her I </i><b><i>was</i></b><i> </i><b><i>not</i></b><i> very happy at work.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>They said: ‘We</i><b><i>’re</i></b><i> </i><b><i>going</i></b><i> home.’</i></td><td><i>They told us they </i><b><i>were</i></b><i> </i><b><i>going</i></b><i> home.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>He said, ‘Jane </i><b><i>will</i></b><i> be late.’</i></td><td><i>He said that Jane </i><b><i>would</i></b><i> be late.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>‘I</i><b><i>’ve</i></b><i> </i><b><i>been</i></b><i> </i><b><i>working</i></b><i>,’ she said.</i></td><td><i>She said she </i><b><i>had been working</i></b><i>.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>‘What </i><b><i>happened</i></b><i> to make her so angry?’ he asked.</i></td><td><i>He asked what </i><b><i>had happened</i></b><i> to make her so angry.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

In these examples, the present (*am*) has become the past (*was*), the future (*will*) has become the future-in-the-past (*would*) and the past (*happened*) has become the past perfect (*had happened*). The tenses have ‘shifted’ or ‘moved back’ in time.

### Backshift changes

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>direct</td><td><br/></td><td>indirect</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>present simple</td><td>→</td><td>past simple</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>present continuous</td><td>→</td><td>past continuous</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>present perfect simple</td><td>→</td><td>past perfect simple</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>present perfect continuous</td><td>→</td><td>past perfect continuous</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>past simple</td><td>→</td><td>past perfect simple</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>past continuous</td><td>→</td><td>past perfect continuous</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>future (will)</td><td>→</td><td>future-in-the-past (would)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>past perfect</td><td>↔</td><td>past perfect (no change)</td></tr></tbody></table>

The past perfect does not shift back; it stays the same:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>Direct speech</td><td>Indirect speech</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>He asked: ‘</i><b><i>Had</i></b><i> the girls already </i><b><i>left</i></b><i>?’</i></td><td><i>He asked if the girls </i><b><i>had</i></b><i> </i><b><i>already</i></b><i> </i><b><i>left</i></b><i>.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Modal verbs

Some, but not all, modal verbs ‘shift back’ in time and change in indirect speech.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><br/></td><td>direct speech</td><td>indirect speech</td><td>change</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>will</i></td><td><i>‘We </i><b><i>will</i></b><i> be there,’ he promised.</i></td><td><i>He promised they </i><b><i>would</i></b><i> be there.</i></td><td><i>will</i> becomes <i>would</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>shall</i></td><td><i>She said, ‘I </i><b><i>shall</i></b><i> need more money.’</i><i>‘</i><b><i>Shall</i></b><i> I open it?’ she asked.</i></td><td><i>She said she </i><b><i>would</i></b><i> need more money.</i><i>She asked if she </i><b><i>should</i></b><i> open it.</i></td><td><i>shall</i> usually becomes <i>would</i>in reported questions, <i>shall</i> becomes <i>should</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>can</i></td><td><i>‘I </i><b><i>can</i></b><i> see you at 2.30,’ he added.</i></td><td><i>He added that he </i><b><i>could</i></b><i> see me at 2.30.</i></td><td><i>can</i> becomes <i>could</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>may</i></td><td><i>‘I </i><b><i>may</i></b><i> be back later,’ she said.</i><i>‘You </i><b><i>may</i></b><i> wait in the hallway,’ he said.</i></td><td><i>She said she </i><b><i>might</i></b><i> be back later.</i><i>He said we </i><b><i>could</i></b><i> wait in the hallway.</i></td><td><i>may</i> (possibility) becomes <i>might</i><i>may</i> (permission) becomes <i>could</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>must</i></td><td><i>She said, ‘You </i><b><i>must</i></b><i> pay by 30th April.’</i><i>‘It </i><b><i>must</i></b><i> be awful to live in such a noisy place,’ she said.</i></td><td><i>She said we </i><b><i>had to</i></b><i> pay by 30th April.</i><i>She said it </i><b><i>must</i></b><i> be awful to live in such a noisy place.</i></td><td><i>must</i> (obligation) usually becomes <i>had to</i><i>must</i> (speculation) does not change</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>could</i></td><td><i>‘We </i><b><i>could</i></b><i> sell it for about 2,000 euros,’ he said.</i></td><td><i>He said they </i><b><i>could</i></b><i> sell it for about 2,000 euros.</i></td><td>no change</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>should</i></td><td><i>‘You </i><b><i>should</i></b><i> go there immediately,’ she said.</i></td><td><i>She said I </i><b><i>should</i></b><i> go there immediately.</i></td><td>no change</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>would</i></td><td><i>‘I </i><b><i>would</i></b><i> buy it if I had the money,’ he said.</i></td><td><i>He said he </i><b><i>would</i></b><i> buy it if he had the money.</i></td><td>no change</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>might</i></td><td><i>‘It </i><b><i>might</i></b><i> snow tonight,’ he warned.</i></td><td><i>He warned that it </i><b><i>might</i></b><i> snow that night.</i></td><td>no change</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>need</i></td><td><i>‘You </i><b><i>needn’t</i></b><i> come till six o’clock,’ he said.</i></td><td><i>He said we </i><b><i>needn’t</i></b><i> come till six o’clock.</i></td><td>no change</td></tr></tbody></table>

We can use a perfect form with *have* + -*ed* form after modal verbs, especially where the report looks back to a hypothetical event in the past:

- *He said the noise **might have been** the postman delivering letters.* (original statement: *‘The noise might be the postman delivering letters.’*)
- *He said he **would have helped** us if we’d needed a volunteer.* (original statement: *‘I’ll help you if you need a volunteer’* or *‘I’d help you if you needed a volunteer.’*)

*Used to* and *ought to* do not change in indirect speech:

- *She said she **used to** live in Oxford.* (original statement: *‘I used to live in Oxford.’*)
- *The guard warned us that we **ought to** leave immediately.* (original statement: *‘You ought to leave immediately.’*)

### No backshift

We don’t need to change the tense in indirect speech if what a person said is still true or relevant or has not happened yet. This often happens when someone talks about the future, or when someone uses the present simple, present continuous or present perfect in their original words:

- *He **told** me his brother **works** for an Italian company.* (It is still true that his brother works for an Italian company.)
- *She **said** she**’s*** ***getting** married next year.* (For the speakers, the time at the moment of speaking is ‘this year’.)
- *He **said** he**’s*** ***finished** painting the door.* (He probably said it just a short time ago.)
- *She promised she**’ll help** us.* (The promise applies to the future.)

## Indirect speech: changes to pronouns

Changes to personal pronouns in indirect reports depend on whether the person reporting the speech and the person(s) who said the original words are the same or different.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>direct</td><td>indirect</td><td><br/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>‘</i><b><i>I</i></b><i> don’t want to shock people,’ </i><b><i>Tom</i></b><i> said.</i></td><td><b><i>Tom</i></b><i> said </i><b><i>he</i></b><i> didn’t want to shock people.</i></td><td>different speakers (<i>I</i> changes to <i>he</i>)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>‘</i><b><i>I</i></b><i>’ll look after Toby,’ </i><b><i>I</i></b><i> said.</i></td><td><b><i>I</i></b><i> said </i><b><i>I</i></b><i> would look after Toby.</i></td><td>same speaker (no change)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>‘</i><b><i>You</i></b><i> need to be here at nine o’clock,’ </i><b><i>George</i></b><i> told Beatrice.</i></td><td><b><i>George</i></b><i> told Beatrice </i><b><i>she</i></b><i> needed to be there at nine o’clock.</i></td><td>different speakers (<i>you</i> changes to <i>she</i>)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>‘</i><b><i>I</i></b><i> hope </i><b><i>you</i></b><i> will join us tonight,’ </i><b><i>I</i></b><i> said to James.</i></td><td><b><i>I</i></b><i> told James </i><b><i>I</i></b><i> hoped </i><b><i>he</i></b><i> would join us that night.</i></td><td>same speaker (no change to <i>I</i>; <i>you</i> changes to <i>he</i>)</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Indirect speech: changes to adverbs and demonstratives

We often change demonstratives (*this, that*) and adverbs of time and place (*now, here, today*, etc.) because indirect speech happens at a later time than the original speech, and perhaps in a different place.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>direct speech</td><td>indirect speech</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I said, ‘I’ll meet you </i><b><i>here tomorrow</i></b><i>.’</i></td><td><i>I told her I would meet her </i><b><i>there</i></b><i> </i><b><i>the next/following day</i></b><i>.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>She said, ‘I do not wish to discuss it </i><b><i>at</i></b><i> </i><b><i>this moment in time</i></b><i>.’</i></td><td><i>She said she did not wish to discuss it </i><b><i>at that moment in time</i></b><i>.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>He said, “I want it </i><b><i>now</i></b><i>.”</i></td><td><i>He said he wanted it </i><b><i>then/at that moment</i></b><i>.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>‘I finished the job </i><b><i>three weeks ago</i></b><i>,’ the boy protested.</i></td><td><i>The boy protested that he had finished the job </i><b><i>three weeks before</i></b><i>.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

Typical changes to demonstratives, adverbs and adverbial expressions

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>direct</td><td><br/></td><td>indirect</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>this</i></td><td><i>→</i></td><td><i>that</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>these</i></td><td><i>→</i></td><td><i>those</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>now</i></td><td><i>→</i></td><td><i>then</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>yesterday</i></td><td><i>→</i></td><td><i>the day before</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>tomorrow</i></td><td><i>→</i></td><td><i>the next/following day</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>two weeks ago</i></td><td><i>→</i></td><td><i>two weeks before</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>here</i></td><td><i>→</i></td><td><i>there</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Indirect speech: typical errors

The word order in indirect reports of *wh-*questions is the same as statement word order (subject + verb), not question word order:

*She always asks me **where** \[S\] \[V\]**I am*** ***going**.*

Not: *~~She always asks me where am I going.~~*

We don’t use a question mark when reporting *wh-*questions:

- *I asked him what he was doing.*
- Not: *~~I asked him what he was doing?~~*
