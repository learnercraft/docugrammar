# Reported speech: reporting nouns

Reporting nouns are nouns such as *comment*, *criticism*, *remark*, *statement*. We can represent indirect speech with reporting nouns as well as with reporting verbs. These are more common in writing than speaking, and are usually quite formal. (Reported speech is underlined.)

- *His* ***remark*** that we hadn’t worked hard enough *upset everyone.* (original remark: *‘You haven’t worked hard enough.’*)
- *The Prime Minister’s* ***comment*** that this was not the right time for an election *has made headlines in all today’s papers.*
- *Jason’s* ***claim*** that he was ignored by everyone *is hard to believe.*
- *Her* ***excuse*** that she had been abroad at the time *was not accepted by the court.*

## Reporting nouns and reported clauses

The reported clause after a reporting noun is usually a *that*\-clause which acts as the complement of the noun. We do not usually omit *that* after reporting nouns:

- *For years, nobody listened to the warnings **that** global temperatures were rising.*
- Not: *~~For years, nobody listened to the warnings global temperatures were rising.~~*

We can also use some reporting nouns (for example *claim, offer, promise*, *suggestion* and *threat*) with a *to*\-infinitive:

- *She made a **promise** to visit him at least once a month.*
- *Nobody took seriously her **threat** to sell the business.*

## Reporting nouns and adjectives

We often use adjectives with reporting nouns to describe particular qualities of what someone said:

- *Her **sudden*** ***announcement** that she was getting divorced came at 5 pm yesterday.*
- *His **feeble*** ***excuse** that he had missed the train convinced nobody.*
