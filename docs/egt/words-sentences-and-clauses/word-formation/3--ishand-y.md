# \-ish and \-y

We can add the suffixes *\-ish* and -*y* to words in informal contexts to make the reference sound deliberately vague and approximate.

We commonly use the suffix *\-ish* when we refer to numbers, times and quantities:

- *Ok, I’ll come and collect you from your house at seven**ish**.*
- A: *How old do you think he is?*
- B: *Forty****ish***. *Possibly older*.

We can add *\-ish* to adjectives, adverbs and prepositions:

- A: *Is he tall, her new boyfriend?*
- B: *Well, tall****ish***.
- A: *Is it far from the supermarket?*
- B: *No, but it’s near the cinema, well, near**ish** to the cinema*.

\-*ish* and *\-y* are not normally interchangeable. *\-ish* is more common than -*y* and *\-y* is principally used with colours (though not black or white):

- *What colour tie do you think goes with this shirt? The green one? Or should it be the blue**y** one?*
