# Compounds

## Compound words

A compound word is two or more words linked together to produce a word with a new meaning:

- tooth + brush = toothbrush
- eco + friendly = eco-friendly
- animal + lover = animal lover

We make compounds in all word classes:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>nouns: <i>car park</i>, <i>soap opera</i></td><td>pronouns: <i>anyone</i>, <i>everything</i>, <i>nobody</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>adjectives: <i>environmentally-friendly</i>, <i>fat-free</i></td><td>numerals: <i>twenty-seven</i>, <i>three-quarters</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>verbs: <i>daydream</i>, <i>dry-clean</i></td><td>prepositions: <i>into</i>, <i>onto</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>adverbs: <i>nevertheless</i>, <i>nowadays</i></td><td>conjunctions: <i>although</i>, <i>however</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Compound nouns

We usually make compound nouns with a noun + noun, with a verb (or a word made from a verb) + noun, or with an adjective + noun:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>noun + noun: <i>earphones</i></td><td>verb <i>-ing</i> form + noun: <i>parking ticket</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>verb base form + noun: <i>rescue team</i></td><td>adjective + noun: <i>blackboard</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

The usual spoken stress pattern is with stress on the first item (***ear****phones*, ***black****board*).

In a compound noun, we can combine different elements. These include:

- subject + verb: earache (an ear that aches), rainfall (rain that falls)
- verb + subject: cleaning products (products that clean)
- verb + object: know-all (person who thinks they know everything)
- object + verb: shoe-polish (polishes shoes), dishwasher (washes dishes)

### Compound adjectives

Compound adjectives most commonly end in an adjective (e.g. *homesick*), or in an -*ing* or -*ed* adjective form (e.g. *ground-breaking, short-sighted*).

### Compound verbs

Compound verbs are far less common than compound nouns or adjectives. They can be made by making a verb from another word class, normally from an already existing compound noun (e.g. *a daydream* – *to daydream*).

### Writing compound words

Sometimes compound words are written separately (*nail polish*), sometimes with a hyphen (*short-sighted*) and sometimes as one word (*eyelashes*). Often new compounds are written as two separate words and, as they become more familiar, they are either connected with a hyphen (-) or made into one word.

There are some general rules and guidelines for when to use hyphens:

- when there is a prefix (e.g. ***post****\-war*, ***pre-****lunch*, ***self-****interest*, ***semi-****skilled*)
- when a compound adjective comes before a head noun (e.g. *a **well-known** singer, an **angry-sounding** email*)
- when the pre-head item in a compound is a single capital letter (e.g. U\-turn, X\-ray, D\-day)
- when words are difficult to recognise as compounds and could be confused

*The band has decided to **re-form**.* (form again)

*The Government promise to **reform** the health system.* (improve)

- when compound adjectives containing numbers appear before a noun

*A **twenty-two-year-old** cyclist won the race.*

*From here to Tokyo, that’s a **twelve-hour** flight at least.*

If you’re not sure about whether to use a hyphen, a good dictionary will tell you.

## Compound sentences

A compound sentence has two or more main clauses linked by coordinating conjunctions, such as *and, but*:

- *\[main clause 1\] She did a nursing degree \[main clause 2\] and she did really well, \[main clause 3\] but she’s decided to study medicine now.*
