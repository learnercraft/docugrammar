# No sooner

*No sooner* is used to show that one thing happens immediately after another thing. It is often used with the past perfect, and usually followed by *than*:

- *\[event 1\] They had **no sooner arrived*** ***than** \[event 2\] they were arguing.*
- *\[event 1\] We had **no sooner** started cooking **than** \[event 2\] there was a power cut and we had no electricity.*

When *no sooner* is used in front position, we invert the order of the auxiliary verb and subject. This is common in more formal and literary styles:

- *\[event 1\] **No sooner** had they started their walk **than** \[event 2\] it started to rain.*
