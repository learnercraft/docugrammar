# Adjectives: order

## Order of adjectives

When more than one adjective comes before a noun, the adjectives are normally in a particular order. Adjectives which describe opinions or attitudes (e.g. *amazing*) usually come first, before more neutral, factual ones (e.g. *red*):

- *She was wearing an **amazing red** coat.*
- Not: … ~~red amazing coat~~

If we don’t want to emphasise any one of the adjectives, the most usual sequence of adjectives is:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>order</td><td>relating to</td><td>examples</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>1</td><td>opinion</td><td><i>unusual, lovely, beautiful</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>2</td><td>size</td><td><i>big, small, tall</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>3</td><td>physical quality</td><td><i>thin, rough, untidy</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>4</td><td>shape</td><td><i>round, square, rectangular</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>5</td><td>age</td><td><i>young, old, youthful</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>6</td><td>colour</td><td><i>blue, red, pink</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>7</td><td>origin</td><td><i>Dutch, Japanese, Turkish</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>8</td><td>material</td><td><i>metal, wood, plastic</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>9</td><td>type</td><td><i>general-purpose, four-sided, U-shaped</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>10</td><td>purpose</td><td><i>cleaning, hammering, cooking</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

- *It was made of a 1 **strange**, 6 **green**, 8 **metallic** material.*
- *It’s a 4 **long**, 8 **narrow**, 10 **plastic** brush.*
- *Panettone is a 4 **round**, 7 **Italian**, 9 **bread-like** Christmas cake.*

Here are some invented examples of longer adjective phrases. A noun phrase which included all these types would be extremely rare.

- *She was a 1 **beautiful**, 2 **tall**, 3 **thin**, 5 **young**, 6 **black-haired**, 7 **Scottish** woman.*
- *What an 1 **amazing**, 2 **little**, 5 **old**, 7 **Chinese** cup and saucer!*

## Adjectives joined by and

When more than one adjective occurs after a verb such as *be* (a linking verb), the second last adjective is normally connected to the last adjective by *and*:

- *Home was always a warm, welcoming place. Now it is sad, dark **and** cold.*

*And* is less common when more than one adjective comes before the noun (e.g. *a warm, welcoming place*). However, we can use *and* when there are two or more adjectives of the same type, or when the adjectives refer to different parts of the same thing:

- *It was a **blue and green** cotton shirt.*
