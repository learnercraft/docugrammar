# Adjective phrases: position

When an adjective is used with a noun, the usual order in English is adjective + noun:

- *a **yellow** balloon*
- Not: *~~a balloon yellow~~*

## Adjectives with nouns and verbs

Adjectives can go before the noun (attributive) or after linking verbs such as *be, become, seem* (predicative):

- *What a **beautiful** flower!* (attributive)
- *This bridge looks **unsafe**.* (predicative)

Some adjectives can only be used in one position or the other.

### Adjectives normally only used before a noun

#### Numbers and first, last

With numbers and with words like *first, last, next*, the usual order is *first/next* + number + adjective + noun:

- *Special offer on the **last three** remaining sofas.*
- *There used to be **two big** fields here when I was young.*
- *I don’t have to work for the **next four** days.*
- *That’s the **second large** study on unemployment this year.*

#### Some adjectives of degree

When we use words like *absolute, complete, perfect* to talk about degree, they can only be used before nouns. This group of adjectives includes *proper, pure, real, sheer, true, utter*:

- *That’s an **absolute** lie. I did not use your car when you were away.*
- Not: *~~That lie is absolute~~*.
- *Lily has always been a **true** friend to me.*
- Not: *~~My friend Lily is true.~~*

#### Some adjectives of time and order

Some time and order adjectives, such as *former, present, future*, are used before the noun only. Other examples are *latter, old* (*an old friend* = ‘a friend for many years’), *early* (*early French literature* = ‘of the initial period in the history of something’), and *late* (*the late Mr Richards* = ‘died recently’):

- *Her **former** husband had bought the house but she never liked it.*
- Not: *~~Her husband was former~~* …
- *This is a church from the **early** Romanesque period*
- Not: *~~This is a church from the Romanesque period~~. ~~The Romanesque period was early.~~*

When we use *early* after a verb (predicatively) it means something different. *The train was* ***early*** means that it came before we expected it.

#### Some adjectives that limit the following noun

Adjectives like *certain*, *main*, *major*, *only*, *particular* limit the noun that they go before (*the only people who know, the particular road that we travelled on*). Other examples are *principal*, *sole* (meaning ‘only’), *very*, *chief*:

- *The **main** reason why the cinema closed is because the building was too old and dangerous.*
- Not: *~~The reason is main why the cinema~~* …
- *That’s the **very** tool I am looking for.* (*very* means ‘exact’)
- Not: *~~That tool is very~~* …

### Adjectives normally only used after a noun

We use some -*ed* forms after a noun:

- *Most of the issues **mentioned** in the documentary are not very important.*
- Not: *~~Most of the mentioned issues~~* …
- *The difference in percentages is clear from the illustrations **shown**.*
- Not: … ~~from the shown illustrations~~.

### Adjectives normally only used after a verb

#### Adjectives with the prefix a\-

We can’t use adjectives with the prefix *a*\- before a noun. We use them after linking verbs such as *be, seem, become, feel, smell, taste*. Common examples of adjectives with the prefix *a-* include *awake, alive, asleep, aboard* (on a plane, boat, bus or train), *afloat, ablaze* (on fire):

- *Katie was **awake** at the time.*
- Not: *~~Katie was an awake person at the time.~~*
- *People were **asleep** in the bedroom.*
- Not: *~~There were asleep people in the bedroom~~*.
- *The passengers were all **aboard** when they heard the loud bang.*
- Not: *~~The aboard passengers heard the loud bang.~~*

If we want to express a similar meaning with an adjective in front of the noun, we can use a related adjective.

It took many firemen to put it out.</i></td><td><i>The cinema was </i><b><i>ablaze</i></b><i> for many hours and it took many firemen to put out the fire.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Some adjectives referring to states of health

Most commonly, the adjectives *ill* and *well* are used after a verb and not before a noun:

- *I feel **ill**.*
- Not: *~~He went to visit his ill sister.~~*
- *She’s not **well**.*
- Not: *~~He’s not a well child.~~*

## Words and phrases that go before and after adjectives

The most typical words and phrases that go before adjectives (premodifiers) are adverb phrases expressing degree:

- *He was **pretty surprised** then.*
- *This cake tastes **a bit strange**.*
- *Photographs are **really cheap** nowadays.*

The major exception is the degree adverb *enough*, which goes after the adjective (a postmodifier):

- *I am **strong enough** to face the difficulties.*
- *Is that car **big enough** for all of us?*

:::note[See also]

- *Enough*

:::

Other types of adverbs can also go before adjectives:

- *He had lost his **usually calm** attitude and become very nervous.* (adverb of frequency + adjective)
- *He made an **insensitively timed** remark that upset her.* (comment adverb + adjective)

## Gradable adjectives and words and phrases that go before them

Most common adjectives can express different degrees of qualities, properties, states, conditions, relations, etc. These are called gradable adjectives:

- *a **pretty big** meal*
- *a **really big** meal*
- *an **extremely big** meal*

Before gradable adjectives, we can use words which show different degrees of the feature in question. These are usually adverb phrases.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>The waves are fairly </i><b><i>high</i></b><i> in the winter.</i><i>The waves are quite </i><b><i>high</i></b><i> in the winter.</i></td><td>an adverb of degree used before gradable adjective <i>high</i>.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>The waves are </i>this<i> </i><b><i>high</i></b><i> in the winter.</i><i>I can’t believe the waves are </i>that <b><i>high</i></b> <i>in the winter</i>.</td><td><i>This high</i> would usually be spoken with a gesture showing a specific height.<i>That high</i> refers to a statement made by someone about the height of the waves or to the moment of seeing the high waves.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>The waves are over six metres </i><b><i>high</i></b><i> in the winter.</i></td><td><i>Six metres</i> is a noun phrase. Certain adjectives expressing measurable features (e.g. height, thickness, age, time) may be modified by such noun phrases:<i>The wall is half a metre </i><b><i>thick</i></b><i>.</i><i>The clock is over 100 years </i><b><i>old</i></b><i>.</i><i>Sorry, we’re half an hour </i><b><i>early</i></b><i>!</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

Some degree adverbs (*so, too, as*) need a word or phrase to complete their meaning (a complement). The complement may be a clause or a phrase. The complement comes after the adjective head.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>The waves were </i>so high that they went onto the street<i>!</i></td><td><i>So</i> is the degree adverb before the adjective <i>high</i>. It needs the complement <i>that they went onto the street</i> in order to complete its meaning.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>The waves are </i>too high to go sailing<i>.</i></td><td><i>Too</i> is the degree adverb before the adjective <i>high</i>. It needs the complement <i>to go sailing</i> in order to complete its meaning.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>The waves are </i>as high as the wall in the winter<i>.</i></td><td>To say that things are the same, we use <i>as +</i> adjective + <i>as +</i> complement.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>The waves are </i>higher than the wall<i> in the winter.</i></td><td>To compare two things which are different, we add the suffix <i>-er</i> to the adjective before the complement.</td></tr></tbody></table>

*How* is used to ask questions and to make exclamations about degree. There is an important difference in word order.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>How </i><b><i>high</i></b><i> are the waves?</i></td><td>A question about degree:<i>how</i> + adjective + verb + noun phrase?</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>How </i><b><i>high</i></b><i> the waves are!</i></td><td>An exclamation about degree:<i>how</i> + adjective + noun phrase + verb!</td></tr></tbody></table>

:::warning

Some adjectives cannot be made bigger, smaller, higher, lower, stronger, weaker, etc. These are called ungradable adjectives:

- *The tree is **dead**.*
- Not: *~~The tree is fairly dead.~~*
- *My dog is **female**.*
- Not: *~~My dog is sort of female.~~*

:::

Other common ungradable adjectives include:

*automatic*/*manual*; *Irish*/*Brazilian*/*Thai* etc.; *married*/*unmarried*/*single*.

## Gradable opposites (antonyms)

### Open-ended

The most common gradable adjectives can be grouped into pairs of opposites (antonyms) which refer to features like height: *short – tall*; heat: *hot – cold*; size: *big – small*, etc. These adjectives are at the upper and lower parts of an open-ended scale (a scale with no maximum or minimum):

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>short</i></td><td><i>tall</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>big</i></td><td><i>small</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

:::warning

We can’t use ungradable adverbs such as *completely, absolutely, entirely, utterly* or *totally* before these adjectives because they are open-ended:

- *My working day is **very** long. I start work at 8 am and I don’t finish until 8 pm.*
- Not: *~~My working day is completely long~~*.
- *My house is **so** hot.*
- Not: *~~My house is absolutely hot~~*.
- *This office is **extremely** small.*
- Not: *~~This office is totally small~~*.

:::

### Maximum and minimum

Some other gradable adjectives can express features which have a maximum and/or minimum (zero) value:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>full</i></td><td><i>empty</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>possible</i></td><td><i>impossible</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>black</i></td><td><i>white</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

We can use degree adverbs such as *absolutely, completely, entirely, totally* and other similar words before these adjectives:

- *We haven’t had rain for two months. The garden is **completely dry**.*
- *The city centre is **absolutely full** of tourists at this time of year.*

Other degree adverbs which we can use before this type of gradable adjective include *almost, barely, half, scarcely*:

- *Brain cell regeneration is **almost possible**, say scientists.*

:::warning

The ungradable adverb *quite* has different meanings depending on whether it is used with an open-ended gradable adjective (*hot – cold*) or an adjective which has a maximum and/or minimum (*black – white*).

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>It’s </i><b><i>quite cold</i></b><i> in here.</i><i>I’m </i><b><i>quite hungry</i></b><i> now. Are you?</i></td><td><i>quite</i> means ‘fairly’</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>The situation in my old job was </i><b><i>quite different</i></b><i>. It was a very small new company.</i><i>You’re </i><b><i>quite right</i></b><i> – the plane leaves at 3 pm, not 4 pm.</i></td><td><i>quite</i> means ‘completely’In this context, <i>quite</i> is given extra spoken stress.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Different meanings of adjectives before the noun and after the verb

We can use some adjectives before the noun or after the verb but the meaning differs.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>before the noun (attributive)</td><td>after the verb (predicative)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>We can finish that job on Monday but this </i><b><i>particular</i></b><i> job needs to be done by today.</i>(<i>particular</i> means ‘this and not any other/specific’)</td><td><i>My boss is very </i><b><i>particular</i></b><i>. He checks all our work very carefully.</i> (<i>particular</i> means not easy to satisfy)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>His </i><b><i>late</i></b><i> wife came from a very rich family.</i> (<i>late</i> means ‘dead/deceased’)</td><td><i>The trains are always </i><b><i>late</i></b><i> on Sundays.</i>(<i>late</i> means ‘not on time’)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>There’s a </i><b><i>certain</i></b><i> amount of truth in that story.</i> (<i>certain</i> means ‘some, but not a specific amount’)</td><td><i>The police are </i><b><i>certain</i></b><i> that the killer was known to the victim.</i> (<i>certain</i> means ‘sure/definite’)</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Adjectives before nouns that modify other nouns

A noun (n) is sometimes used before another noun to give more information about it. This is called a noun modifier. Adjectives (adj) come before noun modifiers:

- *He drives a \[ADJ\] **red** \[N\] **sports** \[N\] car.*
- *That’s an **expensive laser** printer.*

## Order of adjectives in noun phrases with articles and degree modifiers

When adjectives are used before the noun (attributive function), there are also sometimes degree adverbs. Different degree adverbs require different positions for the adjective phrase.

Positions of indefinite article and degree adverbs.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>indefinite article</td><td>degree adverb</td><td>adjective</td><td>noun</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>a/an</i></td><td><i>fairly</i><i>very</i><i>moderately</i><i>extremely</i></td><td><i>cold</i></td><td><i>day</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>indefinite article</td><td>adjective</td><td>degree adverb</td><td>noun</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>a</i></td><td><i>cold</i></td><td><i>enough</i></td><td><i>day</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Special cases

***Quite***: *quite a cold day*

The normal order with *quite* is *quite a cold day*. The order *a quite cold day* (indefinite article + intensifier + adjective) is also possible but it is not as common.

***Rather***: *a rather cold day*

The normal order with *rather* is *a rather cold day*. The order *rather a cold day* (intensifier + indefinite article + adjective) is also possible but it is not as common.

:::note[See also]

- *Quite*
- *Rather*

:::

***As*** and ***so***: *a man as/so tall as him*

The most common order with *as* and *so* in negative clauses in speaking is *a man as/so tall as him* (*as/so* + adjective + *as* + complement):

- *I haven’t seen a man **as tall as** him before.*
- *You won’t often find a room **so small as** that.*

The order *as/so tall a man as him* is also possible but it is more common in writing.
