- *That’s a **big** house.*
- *Look at the **grey** horse.*
- *Some dogs have **long** tails.*
- *She is **tall**.*

## Meanings of adjectives

Adjectives give us more information. They modify or describe features and qualities of people, animals and things.

## Oppositeness

Most common adjectives are members of a pair of opposites (antonyms):

| Word       | Antonym |
|------------|---------|
| *beautiful*| *ugly*  |
| *dead*     | *alive* |
| *happy*    | *sad*   |
| *rough*    | *smooth*|
| *big*      | *small* |
| *dry*      | *wet*   |
| *heavy*    | *light* |
| *tall*     | *short* |
| *cold*     | *hot*   |
| *good*     | *bad*   |

## Gradable and ungradable

Many pairs of opposites are gradable, i.e. they have different degrees of the same feature:

- *Small*:
  - *This suitcase is **extremely small**.*
  - *This suitcase is **very small**.*
  - *This suitcase is **quite small**.*

- *Hot*:
  - *It was **reasonably hot** in Italy this summer.*
  - *It was **quite hot** in Italy this summer.*
  - *It was **pretty hot** in Italy this summer.*
  - *It was **very hot** in Italy this summer.*
  - *It was **extremely hot** in Italy this summer.*

One type of adjective is not gradable. These are the adjectives that we use to classify people and things into types:

:::warning

- *These vegetables are **organic**.*
- Not: *~~These vegetables are very organic.~~*
- *I like salmon especially when it is **wild**.*
- Not: *~~I like salmon especially when it is quite wild.~~*
