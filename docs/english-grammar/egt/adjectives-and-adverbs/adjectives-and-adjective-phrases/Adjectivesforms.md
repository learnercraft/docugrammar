# Adjectives: forms

Unlike in many other languages, adjectives in English do not change (agree) with the noun that they modify:

- *All new **foreign students** are welcome to join the clubs and societies.*
- Not: *~~All new foreigns students~~* …
- *Every room was painted in **different colours**.*
- Not: … ~~in differents colours~~.

## Identifying adjectives

There is no general rule for making adjectives. We know they are adjectives usually by what they do (their function) in a sentence. However, some word endings (suffixes) are typical of adjectives.

| Suffix                      | Examples                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *-able*, *-ible*            | *comfortable, readable, incredible, invisible*                                             |
| *-al*, *-ial*               | *comical, normal, musical, industrial, presidential*                                        |
| *-ful*                      | *beautiful, harmful, peaceful, wonderful*                                                  |
| *-ic*                       | *classic, economic, heroic, romantic*                                                      |
| *-ical*                     | *aeronautical, alphabetical, political*                                                    |
| *-ish*                      | *British, childish, Irish, foolish*                                                        |
| *-ive*, *-ative*            | *active, alternative, creative, talkative*                                                 |
| *-less*                     | *endless, motionless, priceless, timeless*                                                 |
| *-eous*, *-ious*, *-ous*    | *spontaneous, hideous, ambitious, anxious, dangerous, famous*                             |
| *-y*                        | *angry, busy, wealthy, windy*                                                              |

## Forming adjectives from other words

### Suffixes

Some adjectives are made from nouns and verbs by adding suffixes.

| Noun      | Adjective     |
|-----------|---------------|
| *hero*    | *hero****ic*** |
| *wind*    | *wind****y***  |
| *child*   | *child****ish*** |
| *beauty*  | *beauti****ful*** |

| Verb      | Adjective       |
|-----------|-----------------|
| *read*    | *read****able***  |
| *talk*    | *talkat****ive*** |
| *use*     | *use****ful***    |
| *like*    | *like****able***  |

- *I hate **windy** days.*
- *San Francisco is a very **hilly** place.*

Some words ending in *\-ly* can be both adjectives and adverbs. These include *daily*, *early*, *monthly*, *weekly*, *nightly*, *yearly*:

- *Adjective: She gets a **weekly** payment from her parents.* (She gets money every week.)
- *Adverb: I pay my rent **weekly**.* (I pay my rent every week.)

Some words ending in -*ly* are only adjectives and not adverbs. These include: *costly*, *cowardly*, *deadly*, *friendly*, *likely*, *lonely*, *lovely*, *oily*, *orderly*, *scholarly*, *silly*, *smelly*, *timely*, *ugly*, *woolly*.

### Prefixes

Prefixes such as *un-, in-, im-*, *il-* and *ir-* change the meaning of adjectives. Adding these prefixes makes the meaning negative:

| un-               | in-                           | ir-                               | im-                       | il-                   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| *fair – unfair*   | *active – inactive*           | *responsible – irresponsible*     | *balance – imbalance*     | *legal – illegal*     |
| *happy – unhappy* | *appropriate – inappropriate* | *regular – irregular*             | *polite – impolite*       | *legible – illegible* |
| *sure – unsure*   | *complete – incomplete*       | *reducible – irreducible*         | *possible – impossible*   | *logical – illogical* |

## Adjectives: comparative and superlative

Many one-syllable adjectives have endings to show the comparative and superlative.

| Base Form     | Comparative      | Superlative      |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| *fine*        | *fin****er***   | *fin****est***  |
| *young*       | *young****er*** | *young****est***|
| *small*       | *small****er*** | *small****est***|

Some two-syllable adjectives which end in an unstressed syllable also have these endings.

| Base Form     | Comparative      | Superlative      |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| *easy*        | *eas****ier***  | *eas****iest*** |
| *funny*       | *funn****ier*** | *funn****iest***|
| *gentle*      | *gentl****er*** | *gentl****est***|

However, we do not use these endings with two-syllable adjectives ending in a stressed syllable nor with longer adjectives with more than two syllables. The comparatives and superlatives of these adjectives are formed using *more* and *most*.

| Base Form        | Comparative                             | Superlative                                |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| *complete*       | ***more*** *complete*<br/>Not: *~~completer~~ | ***most*** *complete*<br/>Not: ~~completest~~*|
| *interesting*    | ***more*** *interesting*<br/>Not: *~~interestinger~~ | ***most*** *interesting*<br/>Not: ~~interestingest~~*|

## Adjectives: with -ing and -ed (interesting, interested)

We use the -*ing* and -*ed* forms of regular and irregular verbs as adjectives:

### \-ing forms

| Verb       | Example                                                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| *annoy*    | *My brother is five and he’s so **annoying**.*              |
| *amaze*    | *The Grand Canyon is an **amazing** place.*                 |
| *boil*     | *Be careful! That’s **boiling** water!*                     |
| *excite*   | *This film is not very **exciting**, is it?*                |

### \-ed forms

| Verb       | Example                                                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| *bore*     | *Why do teenagers always look **bored**?*                   |

| *make*     | *My dress is **hand-made**. I really like it.*              |
| *teach*    | *My Master’s degree was a **taught** course.*               |
| *excite*   | *I feel **excited** about my new job.*                      |

Adjectives with -*ing* and -*ed* endings have different meanings.

| -**_ing_** adjectives describe the effect           | **_-ed_** adjectives describe how a person feels                  |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *The meeting was very **boring**.* <br/> *That was an **exciting** game.* <br/> *It was **shocking** to see what the storm had done to the house.* | *I felt **bored** at the meeting.* <br/> *We were really **excited** about the game.* <br/> *We were **shocked** to see what the storm had done to the house.* |
