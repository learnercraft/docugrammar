# Comparison: adjectives (bigger, biggest, more interesting)

## Comparative and superlative adjectives

### Comparative adjectives

Comparative adjectives compare one person or thing with another and enable us to say whether a person or thing has more or less of a particular quality:

- *Josh is **taller than** his sister.*
- *I’m **more interested** in music **than** sport.*
- *Big cars that use a lot of petrol are **less popular** now **than** twenty years ago.*

### Superlative adjectives

Superlative adjectives describe one person or thing as having more of a quality than all other people or things in a group:

- *The ‘Silver Arrow’ will be **the fastest train** in the world when it is built.*
- ***The most frightening film*** *I’ve ever seen was Alfred Hitchcock’s ‘Psycho’.*
- *What is **the least expensive way** of travelling in Japan?*

### Comparative or superlative?

A comparative compares a person or thing with another person or thing. A superlative compares a person or thing with the whole group of which that person or thing is a member:

- *Joe’s **older** than Mike.* (comparing one person with another)
- *Sheila is **the youngest** girl in the family.* (comparing one person with the whole group she belongs to)

When there are just two members in a group, traditionally, we use the comparative. However, in informal situations people often use the superlative:

- *Who is **younger**, Rowan or Tony?* (traditional usage)
- *Jan and Barbara are both tall, but Jan’s **the tallest**.* (more informal)

## Comparative and superlative adjectives: form

### One-syllable adjectives (big, cold, hot, long, nice, old, tall)

To form the comparative, we use the -*er* suffix with adjectives of one syllable:

- *It’s **colder** today than yesterday.*
- *It was a **longer** holiday than the one we had last year.*
- *Sasha is **older** than Mark.*

To form the superlative, we use the -*est* suffix with adjectives of one syllable. We normally use *the* before a superlative adjective:

- *I think that’s **the biggest** apple I’ve ever seen!*
- *At one time, the Empire State building in New York was **the tallest** building in the world.*
- *They have three boys. Richard is **the oldest** and Simon is **the youngest**.*

Note the pronunciation of these comparatives and superlatives:

- *long* /lɒŋ/ *longer* /lɒŋgə(r)/ *longest* /lɒŋgəst/
- *strong* /strɒŋ/ *stronger* /strɒŋgə(r)/ *strongest* /strɒŋgəst/
- *young* /jʌŋ/ *younger* /jʌŋgə(r)/ *youngest* /jʌŋgəst/

#### One-syllable adjectives which are irregular

Some one-syllable adjectives have irregular comparative and superlative forms:

- *bad, worse, worst* *far, farther*/*further, farthest*/*furthest*
- *good, better, best* *old, older*/*elder, oldest*/*eldest*
- *The morning flight is **better** than the afternoon one.*
- *His **elder** sister works for the government.*
- *Olivia is Denise’s **best** friend.*
- *I think that was the **worst** film I’ve ever seen!*
- *Pluto is **the furthest** planet from the sun in our solar system.*

:::warning

We do not use *more* or *most* together with an -*er* or -*est* ending:

- *They emigrate because they are looking for a **better** life.*
- Not: … ~~a more better life~~

- *The beach at Marmaris is one of* ***the biggest in Turkey.***
- Not: … ~~the most biggest~~ …

:::note[See also]

- *Farther*, *farthest* or *further*, *furthest*?
- *Elder*, *eldest* or *older*, *oldest*?

:::

### Two-syllable adjectives

Two-syllable adjectives ending in *\-y* change *y* to *i* and take the -*er* and -*est* endings:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>bus</i><b><i>y</i></b>, <i>bus</i><b><i>ier</i></b>, <i>bus</i><b><i>iest</i></b></td><td><i>happ</i><b><i>y</i></b>, <i>happ</i><b><i>ier</i></b>, <i>happ</i><b><i>iest</i></b></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>eas</i><b><i>y</i></b>, <i>eas</i><b><i>ier</i></b>, <i>eas</i><b><i>iest</i></b></td><td><i>funn</i><b><i>y</i></b>, <i>funn</i><b><i>ier</i></b>, <i>funn</i><b><i>iest</i></b></td></tr></tbody></table>

- *We were **busier** last week than this week.*
- *Are you **happier** now that you’ve changed your job?*
- *That was **the easiest** exam I’ve ever taken.*

Some other two-syllable adjectives (especially those ending in an unstressed vowel sound) can also take the -*er* and -*est* endings:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>clever, clever</i><b><i>er</i></b>, <i>clever</i><b><i>est</i></b></td><td><i>quiet, quiet</i><b><i>er</i></b>, <i>quiet</i><b><i>est</i></b></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>narrow, narrow</i><b><i>er</i></b>, <i>narrow</i><b><i>est</i></b></td><td><i>simple, simpl</i><b><i>er</i></b>, <i>simpl</i><b><i>est</i></b></td></tr></tbody></table>

- *I’ve always thought that Donald was **cleverer** than his brother.*
- *This new bed is **narrower** than the old one.*
- *The guest bedroom is **the quietest** room in the house because it overlooks the garden.*

We don’t normally use the -*er* and *\-est* endings with two-syllable adjectives ending in *\-ful*. Instead, we use *more* and *most/least*:

- *This dictionary is **more useful** than the one we had before.*
- Not: *~~This dictionary is usefuller~~* …
- *You’ll have to try to be **more careful** in future.*
- ***The most useful*** *tool in the kitchen is a good sharp knife.*
- Not: *~~The usefulest tool in the kitchen~~* …
- *This is **the least harmful** chemical in terms of the environment.*

### Longer adjectives

Adjectives of three or more syllables form the comparative with *more/less* and the superlative with *most/least*:

- *The second lecture was **more interesting** than the first.*
- Not: *~~The second lecture was interestinger~~* …

- *That way of calculating the figures seems **less complicated** to me.*
- *London is **the most popular** tourist destination in England.*
- Not: *~~London is the popularest~~* …
- *If you are going as a group, **the least expensive** option is to rent an apartment or villa.*

## Comparative adjectives: using much, a lot, far, etc

We can strengthen or emphasise a comparative adjective using words such as *much, a lot, far, even* or *rather*, or by using *than ever* after the adjective:

- *This food is **much better** than the food we had yesterday.*
- *The town is **a lot more crowded** these days because of the new shopping centre.*
- *Alex is **far less intelligent** than the other kids in the class.*
- *We’ve been **busier than ever** at work this last month or so.*

We can soften a comparative adjective using *a little* or *a bit*. *A bit* is less formal:

- *She feels **a little more confident** now that she’s given her first public performance.*
- or *She feels **a bit more confident** …* (less formal)

## Comparative adjectives: using than

We use *than* when we mention the second person or thing in the comparison. If the second person mentioned takes the form of a personal pronoun, we normally use the object form of the pronoun (*me, you, him, her, us, them*):

- *Could you carry this? You’re stronger **than me**.*
- Not: *~~You’re stronger than I.~~*
- *Why did you choose Robert? Marie is more experienced **than him**.*

In more formal situations, instead of *than* + object pronoun, we can use *than* + subject pronoun + *be*:

- *You managed to answer the ten questions correctly? Well, you’re definitely cleverer **than I am**!*
- *I preferred Henrietta to Dennis. She was always more sociable **than he was**.*

## Comparative adjectives: -er and -er, more and more

To talk about how a person or thing is changing and gaining more of a particular quality, we can use two -*er* form adjectives connected by *and*, or we can use *more and more* before an adjective. We don’t follow such comparisons with *than*:

- *The weather is getting **hotter and hotter**.*
- *I’m getting **more and more interested** in conservation these days.*

## Comparative adjectives: the -er, the -er and the more …, the more …

If a person or things gains more of a particular quality and this causes a parallel increase of another quality, we can repeat *the* + a comparative adjective:

- ***The colder*** *it is, **the hungrier** I get.* (as the weather gets colder, I get hungrier)
- ***The more generous*** *you are towards others, **the more generous** they are likely to be towards you.*

## Reduced forms after comparatives

After *than*, we often don’t repeat subject pronouns with impersonal subjects, or auxiliary verbs with passive voice verbs:

- *The exam results were **better than predicted**.* (preferred to … *better than people predicted*.)
- *Temperatures that summer were **higher than previously recorded**.* (preferred to … *than were previously recorded*.)

## Less and not as/not so with comparatives

We use *less* with longer adjectives (*interesting, beautiful, complicated*), but we don’t normally use *less* with short adjectives of one syllable (*big, good, high, small*). Instead we use *not as … as* …, or *not so … as … Not as* is more common than *not so*:

- *The second method was **less complicated than** the first one.*
- *This new laptop is **not as fast as** my old one. I’m sorry I bought it now.* (preferred to *is less fast than my old one*.)

## Prepositions after superlative adjectives

We don’t normally use *of* before a singular name of a place or group after a superlative adjective:

- *The castle is **the oldest** building in the city.*
- Not: *~~The castle is the oldest building of the city~~* …
- *She’s **the youngest** musician in the orchestra.*

However, we can use *of* with a plural word referring to a group:

- *All the sisters are pretty, but Sarah’s **the prettiest** of them all.*

## The with superlative adjectives

When a superlative adjective is followed by a noun, we normally use *the*:

- *This is **the best meal** I’ve had for a long time.*
- Not: *~~This is best meal~~* …

In informal situations, we can often omit *the* after a linking verb (*be, seem*) or a verb of the senses (*look, taste*) if there is no noun:

- \[talking about sweaters in a shop\]
- *They’ve got them in red, green or grey. Which looks **best**?*
- *If you want to get a message to Peter, email is **quickest**. He never answers the phone.*

## Other determiners with superlative adjectives

Before a superlative adjective, we can use a possessive determiner (*my, his, their*), or *the* + a number (*two, three, first, second*), or a possessive determiner + a number:

- ***My worst*** *score ever in an exam was zero. I just couldn’t answer any of the questions.*
- *Birmingham is the **second biggest** city in England.*
- ***His two best*** *friends organised a surprise party for him on his fortieth birthday.*

## Emphasising superlative adjectives

We can make a superlative adjective stronger with *by far, easily* or *of all*:

- *The Beatles were **by far the most successful** rock band of the 1960s.*
- *This method is **by far the least complicated**.*
- *She’s **easily the best** dancer in the group. No one is as elegant as her.*
- *There were a number of excellent poems entered for the competition, but **the best** poem **of all** was written by a ten-year-old boy.*

In more formal situations, we can use *quite*:

- *This is **quite the most irresponsible** behaviour I have ever seen.*

## To\-infinitives after superlative adjectives

We can use a *to*\-infinitive after a superlative adjective, with a meaning similar to a relative clause with *who*, *which* or *that*:

- *Who was **the oldest** person **to compete** in the London Marathon of 2008?* (Who was the oldest person who competed …?)
- *The Golden Swan was **the largest** sailing-ship ever **to be used** in battle.*

## Comparative adjectives: typical errors

A comparative adjective is followed by *than*, not *that* or *as*:

- *The next hotel we tried was **more expensive than** the first one.*
- Not: … ~~more expensive that the first one~~ … or …~~more expensive as the first one~~ …

After a superlative adjective, we don’t normally use *of* before a singular name of a place or group:

- *She was **the tallest** girl in the team.*
- Not: *~~She was the tallest girl of the team~~*.

We use the superlative, not the comparative, when we compare more than two people or things:

- *Which is the city’s **biggest** hotel?*
- Not: … ~~bigger hotel~~
