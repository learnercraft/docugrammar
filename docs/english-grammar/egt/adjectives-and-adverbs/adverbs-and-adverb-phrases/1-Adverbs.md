# Adverbs

## Adverbs: uses

Adverbs are one of the four major word classes, along with nouns, verbs and adjectives. We use adverbs to add more information about a verb, an adjective, another adverb, a clause or a whole sentence and, less commonly, about a noun phrase.

- *Can you move it **carefully**? It’s fragile.*
- ***Quickly****! We’re late.*
- *She swims **really** well.*
- *Don’t go so **fast**.*
- *You have to turn it **clockwise**.*
- *Come over **here**.*
- ***Actually****, I don’t know her.*
- *I haven’t seen them **recently**.*
- *The bathroom’s **upstairs** on the left.*

## Adverbs: meanings and functions

Adverbs have many different meanings and functions. They are especially important for indicating the time, manner, place, degree and frequency of something.
