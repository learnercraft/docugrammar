# Adverb phrases

## Adverb phrases: forms

An adverb phrase consists of one or more words. The adverb is the head of the phrase and can appear alone or it can be modified by other words. Adverbs are one of the four major word classes, along with nouns, verbs and adjectives.

In the examples the adverb phrases are in bold. The other words that modify the adverb are underlined:

- *We **usually** go on holiday in August.*
- *Time goes* very ***quickly****.*
- *The day passed* ***quickly*** enough*.*
- *This works* really ***well*** for its size*.*
- ***Luckily*** for us*, the cost was not so high.*
- *We kept the new money* quite ***separately*** from what we’d already collected*.*

In general, these patterns are similar to adjective phrases.

## Adverb phrases: functions

### Adverb phrases + verbs

We use adverb phrases most commonly to modify verbs. In the examples the adverb phrases are in bold. The verbs that they modify are underlined:

- *Children* grow up ***really quickly****.*
- *I* exercise ***very regularly*** *and I* eat ***quite healthily****.*

### Adverb phrases + be

We use adverb phrases with *be*. This is especially typical of adverbs of place:

- *I’*m ***upstairs****. I’ll only be a minute.*
- A: *Have you seen my gloves?*
- B: *They’*re ***right there***, *on the table*.

### Adverb phrases + adjectives/adverbs

We use adverb phrases (adv) to modify adjectives and other adverbs:

- *I found it \[ADV\] **extremely** \[adjective\]* difficult *to talk to her.*
- *He drives \[ADV\] **really** \[ADV\]* carefully*.*

### Adverb phrases + other phrases

We use adverb phrases (adv) to modify noun phrases (np) and prepositional phrases:

- *That’s \[ADV\] **quite** \[NP\]* a tree*.* (it’s a tree that is special in some way, e.g. it’s very big)
- *There was \[ADV\] **hardly** \[pronoun\]* anyone *at the concert.*
- *We climbed \[ADV\] **right** \[prepositional phrase\]* over the top of the hill *and down again.*

### Adverb phrases + determiners

We use adverb phrases to modify determiners, especially words like *all, some, half, many* (quantifiers):

- ***Only half*** *of my friends could come to my party.*
- ***Very few*** *people have heard of my city. It’s very small.*
