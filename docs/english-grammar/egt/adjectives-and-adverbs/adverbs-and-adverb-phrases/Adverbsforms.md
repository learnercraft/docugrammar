# Adverbs: forms

## Adverbs ending in -ly

Adverbs have a strong connection with adjectives. Adjectives and adverbs are usually based on the same word. Adverbs often have the form of an adjective + -*ly*.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>adjective</td><td>adverb</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>He was </i><b><i>calm</i></b><i> when I told him.</i></td><td><i>He behaved </i><b><i>calmly</i></b><i>.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>That was a </i><b><i>beautiful</i></b><i> presentation, Carla.</i></td><td><i>Your work is </i><b><i>beautifully</i></b><i> presented, Carla.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

Adverbs ending in *\-ly* are usually adverbs of manner (*slowly*) and degree (*completely, fairly*).

Adverbs formed from adjectives ending in *\-l* have double *l*:

*beautiful → beautifully, careful → carefully, hopeful → hopefully, historical → historically*

- *Magda looked **hopefully** at her mother.*
- ***Historically****, there was never any conflict between the two communities.*

Adverbs formed from adjectives ending in *\-y* change the *y* to *i*:

*easy → easily, busy → busily, lucky → luckily, angry → angrily*

- ***Luckily****, I had a backup copy of the data on a disk.*
- *I’ve never seen him react so **angrily**.*

Adverbs ending in a consonant *+e* keep the *e*:

*definite → definitely, fortunate → fortunately, extreme → extremely, absolute → absolutely*

- *I am **extremely** grateful to you.*
- *We were **absolutely** exhausted at the end of it all.*

## Adverbs ending in -ward(s) or -wise

There is a small group of adverbs which end in -*ward(s*) or -*wise*. The -*ward*(*s*) words can end in either -*ward* or -*wards* (*inward, inwards*).

- ***\-wards:*** *inwards, eastwards, upwards, downwards*
- ***\-wise:*** *clockwise, lengthwise, likewise*
- *The doctor asked her to move her head **upwards** but she couldn’t.*
- *Turn the handle **clockwise** to start it.*
- *He’s the one that they all love. Whatever he does, they do **likewise**.* (They do the same thing.)

## Adverbs with the same form as adjectives

Some adverbs have the same form as adjectives. The most common are: *fast* (not fastly), *left, hard, outside, right, straight, late, well*, and time words such as *daily, weekly, monthly, yearly*.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>adjective</td><td>adverb</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>This coconut is really </i><b><i>hard</i></b><i>. You’ll need a hammer to break it up.</i></td><td><i>You have to bang the door </i><b><i>hard</i></b><i> to shut it.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>She drives a </i><b><i>fast</i></b><i> car.</i></td><td><i>They can swim quite </i><b><i>fast</i></b><i> now actually.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>An </i><b><i>outside</i></b><i> light would be a really good idea for our house.</i></td><td><i>When I went </i><b><i>outside</i></b><i>, the light came on automatically.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I get a </i><b><i>monthly</i></b><i> pay cheque.</i></td><td><i>My company pays me </i><b><i>monthly</i></b><i>.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

:::warning

Don’t confuse adjectives and adverbs. Adjectives modify nouns or are used after verbs such as *be, become, seem, look, smell, taste*.

- *She walks very **elegantly**.* (adverb of manner, describing how she walks)
- *He wore an **elegant** suit and a silk tie.* (adjective describing the suit)
- *She looks very **elegant** in that long skirt.* (adjective after *look*)

## Adjectives ending in -ly

Some adjectives end in *\-ly*, e.g. *lively, lonely, ugly*. We don’t form adverbs from these adjectives because they are not easy to pronounce. We usually reword what we want to say instead.

- *Don’t act **in a silly way**.*
- Not: *~~Don’t act sillily.~~*
- *She said it **in a friendly way**.*
- Not: *~~She said it friendlily.~~*

## Adverbs not related to adjectives

Some adverbs (e.g. *just, quite, so, soon, too, very*) are not directly related to adjectives:

- *This is **just** what I am looking for.* (*just* = exactly)
- *These cups are not **quite** the same.* (*not quite* = not exactly)
- *Why is this road **so** narrow?*
- *I look forward to seeing you **soon**.*
- *That’s **too** expensive.*
- *That’s a **very** strange story.*

## Gradable adverbs

Most adverbs, like most adjectives, are gradable (they can express different degrees of qualities, properties, states, conditions and relations). We can modify adverbs using other types of adverbs and comparative forms to make longer adverb phrases.
