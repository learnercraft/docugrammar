# Adverbs: types

## Time, place and manner adverbs (early, there, slowly)

### Time adverbs

Time adverbs tell us about *when* something happens.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>already</i></td><td><i>lately</i></td><td><i>still</i></td><td><i>tomorrow</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>early</i></td><td><i>now</i></td><td><i>soon</i></td><td><i>yesterday</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>finally</i></td><td><i>recently</i></td><td><i>today</i></td><td><i>yet</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

- *Have you seen Laurie **today**?*
- *I’d prefer to leave **early**.*
- *I went to the cinema on my own **recently**.*
- *There’s been an increase in house burglary **lately**.*

### Place adverbs

Place adverbs tell us about *where* something happens or where something is.

- *There was somebody standing **nearby**.*
- *Is that your scarf **there**?*
- *You go **upstairs** and do your homework. I’ll come up in a minute.*

### Manner adverbs

Manner adverbs tell us about *the way* something happens or is done.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>accurately</i></td><td><i>beautifully</i></td><td><i>expertly</i></td><td><i>professionally</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>anxiously</i></td><td><i>carefully</i></td><td><i>greedily</i></td><td><i>quickly</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>badly</i></td><td><i>cautiously</i></td><td><i>loudly</i></td><td><i>quietly</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

Manner adverbs are often formed from adjectives by adding *\-ly*:

- *She spoke very **loudly**. We could all hear what she was saying.*
- *We waited **anxiously** by the phone.*
- *We walked up the stairs very **quietly** because Mum and Dad were asleep.*

Some common manner adverbs have the same form as adjectives and they have similar meanings (e.g. *fast, right, wrong*, *straight, tight*).

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>adjective</td><td>adverb</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I was never a </i><b><i>fast</i></b><i> swimmer</i></td><td><i>Driving </i><b><i>fast</i></b><i> is dangerous</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>All of your answers were </i><b><i>wrong</i></b><i>.</i></td><td><i>People always spell my name </i><b><i>wrong</i></b><i>.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Is that the </i><b><i>right</i></b><i> time?</i></td><td><i>That builder never does anything </i><b><i>right</i></b><i>!</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>My hair is </i><b><i>straight</i></b><i>.</i></td><td><i>Let’s go </i><b><i>straight</i></b><i> to the airport.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Degree adverbs (slightly) and focusing adverbs (generally)

Degree and focusing adverbs are the most common types of modifiers of adjectives and other adverbs. Degree adverbs express degrees of qualities, properties, states, conditions and relations. Focusing adverbs point to something.

### Degree adverbs

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>absolutely</i></td><td><i>enough</i></td><td><i>perfectly</i></td><td><i>somewhat</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>a (little) bit</i></td><td><i>entirely</i></td><td><i>pretty</i></td><td><i>terribly</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>a lot</i></td><td><i>extremely</i></td><td><i>quite</i></td><td><i>too</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>almost</i></td><td><i>fairly</i></td><td><i>rather</i></td><td><i>totally</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>awfully</i></td><td><i>highly</i></td><td><i>remarkably</i></td><td><i>utterly</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>completely</i></td><td><i>lots</i></td><td><i>slightly</i></td><td><i>very</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

- *Mary will be staying **a bit longer**.* (*a bit longer* = for a little more time)
- *It all happened **pretty quickly**.*
- *She was **quite** surprised they came, **actually**.*
- *It was £3.52 if you want to be **totally** accurate.*

### Focusing adverbs

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>especially</i></td><td><i>just</i></td><td><i>mainly</i></td><td><i>particularly</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>generally</i></td><td><i>largely</i></td><td><i>only</i></td><td><i>simply</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

- *I **just** wanted to ask you what you thought.*
- *I wouldn’t **particularly** like to move to a modern house.*

## Evaluative adverbs (surprisingly) and viewpoint adverbs (personally)

We put some adverbs outside the clause. They modify the whole sentence or utterance. Evaluative and viewpoint adverbs are good examples of this:

- *The electric car, **surprisingly**, does not really offer any advantages over petrol cars.* (evaluative)
- ***Personally****, I think the show was great.* (viewpoint)

## Linking adverbs (then, however)

Linking adverbs show a relationship between two clauses or sentences (e.g. a sequence in time, cause and effect, contrast between two things):

- *I left my house in the morning \[sequence\] **then** I went to pick up Leanne at her house.*
- *\[cause\] We talked until the early hours and \[effect\] **consequently** I overslept the next morning.* (the result of the late night is that I was late the next morning)
- *The sun will be shining in France. \[contrast\] **However**, heavy rain is expected in Spain.*

:::warning

We can use *then* and *consequently* to join clauses or sentences. We usually use *but* not *however* to connect two clauses in the same sentence:

- *There was no room for them **but** they got on the train.*
- *There was no room for them. **However**, they got on the train.*
