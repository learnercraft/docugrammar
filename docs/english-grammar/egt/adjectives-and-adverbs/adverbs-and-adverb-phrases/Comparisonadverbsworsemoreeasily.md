# Comparison: adverbs (worse, more easily)

## Adverbs: comparative and superlative forms

Adverbs do not normally change in form, but a few have comparative and superlative forms. These are usually short adverbs and so they normally have comparative and superlative forms with -*er* and -*est*.

Some of the most common comparative and superlative adverbs are:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>soon sooner soonest</i></td><td><i>fast faster fastest</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>hard harder hardest</i></td><td><i>near nearer nearest</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>early earlier earliest</i></td><td><i>far farther/further farthest/furthest</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>late later latest</i></td><td><br/></td></tr></tbody></table>

- *Teachers always say that students must work **harder**.*
- *The kids were playing in the garden, seeing who could jump **highest**.*

:::warning

We don’t use *more* or *most* together with an -*er* or -*est* ending:

- *Children learn things **faster** than adults.*
- Not: … ~~more faster than adults.~~
- *Who ran **slowest** in the race?*
- Not: *~~Who ran most slowest~~*

:::

## Adverbs with more and most

Adverbs with two or more syllables form the comparative and superlative with *more* and *most*:

- *We need to treat the environment **more carefully**.*
- *It was **the most beautifully** designed chair.*

## Comparative adverbs: using than

When we mention the second person or thing in the comparison, we use *than*. We do not use *that* or *as*. If the second person mentioned takes the form of a personal pronoun, we normally use the object form of the pronoun (*me, you, him, her, us, them*):

- *I can’t keep up with him – he runs much faster **than me**.*
- Not: *~~faster that me or faster as me~~*

In more formal situations, instead of *than* + object pronoun, we can use *than* + subject pronoun + *be, do* or a modal verb:

- *My wife drives more carefully **than I do**.*
- *She can read music much more quickly **than I can**.*

## Well and badly

The adverb *well* has the same comparative and superlative forms as the adjective *good* (*better*, *best*). The adverb *badly* has the comparative and superlative forms *worse*, *worst*:

- \[talking about playing tennis\]
- *I played **better** yesterday but I need to improve my serve.*
- *A lot of people behaved badly at the party, but she behaved **worst** of all.*
