- *She took her employer to court because she claimed that she hadn’t been treated **fairly**.*

We also use *fairly* as an adverb of degree before adjectives and adverbs to mean ‘quite, but less than very’:

- *My mother says that her family was **fairly** poor when she was growing up.*

- Not: … ~~in a fairly way.~~
- *I believe everyone should be treated **fairly**.*
- Not: … ~~treated fair.~~
