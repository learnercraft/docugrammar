# Rather

We use *rather* as a degree adverb (*rather cold, rather nice*). We also use it to express alternatives and preferences (*green rather than blue, coffee rather than tea, slowly rather than quickly*).

## Rather as a degree adverb

We use *rather* to give emphasis to an adjective or adverb. It has a similar meaning to *quite* when *quite* is used with gradable words. It is more formal than *quite*. We often use it to express something unexpected or surprising:

- A: *You’re not just wasting your time here, are you?*
- B: *No, I’m **rather** busy, in fact*.
- *They walked **rather** slowly.*
- *I’m afraid I behaved **rather** badly.*

- *Quite*

### Rather with adjective + noun

With *a/an* we usually use *rather a/an* + adjective + noun, but we can also use *a rather* + adjective + noun. With other determiners (*some, those*) we use determiner + *rather* + adjective + noun:

- *We had to wait **rather a** long time.* (or, less common, *We had to wait **a rather** long time*.)
- *He helped her out of **rather an** uncomfortable situation.* (or *He helped her out of **a rather** uncomfortable situation*.)
- *I had **some rather** bad news today.*
- Not: *~~I had rather some bad news today.~~*

### Rather a \+ noun

*Rather a* with a noun is more common in formal language than in informal language, particularly in writing:

- *It was **rather a** surprise to find them in the house before me.*

### Rather a lot

We often use *rather* with *a lot* to refer to large amounts and quantities:

- *It cost me **rather a lot** of money.*
- *You’ve given me **rather a lot**.*

We also use *rather a lot* to mean ‘often’:

- *They went there **rather a lot**.*
- *You’ll be seeing **rather a lot** of me over the next few weeks.*

### Rather \+ verb

We can use *rather* to emphasise verbs. We use it most commonly with verbs such as *enjoy, hope, like*:

- *I was **rather** hoping you’d forgotten about that.*
- *He **rather** liked the idea of a well-paid job in Japan.*

### Rather: comparison

We use *rather* with *more* and *less* + an adjective or adverb in formal writing to make a comparison with something:

- *Quite probably you simply didn’t realise that peas and beans and sweet-corn are such valuable vegetables, and you will now continue to eat them **rather*** ***more frequently** because you like them anyway.*
- *Now that she saw Rupert again, he was **rather less interesting** and a little older than she had remembered him.*

### Rather like

We use *rather* with *like* to refer to similarities. We use *rather like* to mean ‘quite similar to’:

## Rather than: alternatives and preferences

We use *rather than* to give more importance to one thing when two alternatives or preferences are being compared:

- *He wanted to be an actor **rather than** a comedian.*
- *Can we come over on Saturday **rather than** Friday?*

*Rather than* usually occurs between two things which are being compared. However, we can also use it at the beginning of a sentence. When we use *rather than* with a verb, we use the base form or (less commonly) the *\-ing* form of a verb:

- ***Rather than*** *pay the taxi fare, he walked home.* (or ***Rather than*** *paying the taxi fare, he walked home*.)
- Not: *~~Rather than to pay~~* …

## Or rather

We use *or rather* to correct ourselves:

- *He commanded and I obeyed, **or rather**, I pretended to.*
- *Thanks to his efforts, **or rather** the efforts of his employees, they made a decent profit.*
