# Intensifiers (very, at all)

Intensifiers are adverbs or adverbial phrases that strengthen the meaning of other expressions and show emphasis. Words that we commonly use as intensifiers include *absolutely*, *completely, extremely, highly, rather, really, so, too, totally, utterly, very* and *at all*:

- *She was **so** upset. I felt **extremely** sorry for her.*
- *She has a **very** strict teacher.*
- *Don’t work **too** hard. Sometimes you’ll get more done by relaxing a bit.*
- *I don’t think she understood the topic and her essay was **rather** a mess.*
- *She’s **really** offended her sister.*

*At all* is a very common intensifier with negative expressions:

- *Are there no suitable DVDs **at all**?*
- *I’m afraid I’m not **at all** interested.*

We also use *on earth* and *ever* as intensifiers with *wh*\-words:

- ***What on earth*** *is he doing?* (suggests disapproval)
- ***Why*** *did I **ever** invite them to stay with us?* (suggests that there were problems)
