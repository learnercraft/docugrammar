# Much, a lot, lots, a good deal: adverbs

We use *much, a lot, lots* and *a good deal* as adverbs to refer to frequency, quantity and degree.

## Much

We use *much* in questions and negative clauses to talk about degrees of something. We put it in end position:

- *I don’t like the sea **much**.*

:::warning

We don’t use *much* in affirmative clauses:

- *I hadn’t seen my mother for a month. I’d missed her **a lot**.*
- Not: … ~~I’d missed her much.~~

:::

In informal styles, we often use *much* in questions and negative clauses to mean ‘very often’:

- *Do you see Peter* ***much?***
- *I haven’t played tennis **much** this year.*

In formal styles, we use *much* as an intensifier meaning ‘really’ with verbs that express likes and dislikes:

- *He **much** enjoyed his week in the 5-star hotel.*
- *Thank you for your help. It was **much** appreciated.*

### Very much

We often use *very much* as an intensifier in affirmative and negative clauses and questions:

- \[in a formal letter\]
- *Please find attached my report. I **very much** welcome your comments.*
- *Is she **very much** like her father?*

:::warning

With the verb *like* we don’t put ***very much*** between the verb and its object:

- *I like comedy films **very much**.*
- Not: *~~I like very much comedy films.~~*

:::

### Too much, so much

We often use *too much* to mean an excessive amount, ‘more than enough’:

- *He talks **too much**.*
- *You worry **too much**.*

We can also use *so much* to mean *‘*to a large degree’ or ‘a large amount’ or ‘a lot’:

- *She’s changed **so much**. I hardly recognised her.*
- *I’ve eaten **so much**.*

:::note[See also]

- *Too*
- *So*

## A lot, a good deal and a great deal

We can use *a lot*, *a good deal* and *a great deal* as adverbs of frequency, quantity or degree:

- A: *Have you ever been to Brosh?*
- B: *Actually we go there* ***a lot***.
- *I’m really hungry now. I didn’t have **a lot** for breakfast.*

*A good deal* and *a great deal* are more formal than *a lot*.
