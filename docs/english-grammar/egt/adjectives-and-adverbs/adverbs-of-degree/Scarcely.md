# Scarcely

*Scarcely* means ‘almost not at all’. It is quite formal. It usually comes in the normal mid position for adverbs (between the subject and the main verb, or after the modal verb or first auxiliary verb, or after *be* as a main verb):

- *We **scarcely** had time to think and had to act immediately.*
- *These days there is **scarcely** a week without a major political scandal.* (after *be*)
- *I could **scarcely** believe that she had once killed someone.* (after modal *could* = I could almost not believe it at all)

We can also use *scarcely* when something happens immediately after something else:

- *Lena had **scarcely** got through the door **when** the phone rang. It was Mrs Bate.* (Lena entered the house; the phone rang immediately.)

If we use *scarcely* in front position, we invert the subject and the verb. This usage is quite formal:

- ***Scarcely*** ***had*** ***the demonstration*** *started when trouble broke out and the police moved in to arrest people.*

In all of the examples above, we can use *hardly* instead of *scarcely*. *Scarcely* is more formal and less common than *hardly*.
