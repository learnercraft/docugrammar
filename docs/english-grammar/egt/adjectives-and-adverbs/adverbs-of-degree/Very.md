# Very

## Very before adverbs and adjectives

We use *very* before adverbs and adjectives to add emphasis. It means ‘to a great degree’:

- *He drives **very** fast.*
- *The letter came **very** quickly.*
- *It’s **very** cold in here.*
- *We need a **very** high ladder to get onto the roof.*

## When not to use very

### Not before \-ed forms in passive voice

We use *very much* or *well*, not *very*, before *\-ed* forms in passive voice verb phrases with verbs such as *enjoy, hate, know, like, love*:

- *She is **very much liked** at school.*
- Not: *~~She is very liked~~* …

- *He is **well-known** in his village as a trouble-maker.*
- Not: *~~He is very known~~* …

- *The concert was **very much enjoyed** by everyone.*
- Not: *~~The concert was very enjoyed~~* …

### Not before comparatives

We use *very much* not *very* to add emphasis to comparative adverbs and adjectives:

- *Omah is **very much better** than Ian at basketball.*
- Not: *~~Omah is very better than Ian~~* …

- *London is **very much bigger** than Naples.*
- Not: *~~London is very bigger than Naples~~*.

### Not before some superlatives

We can use *very* before superlative adjectives that end in -*est* (including *best* and *worst*), but we don’t use it before superlatives which use *the most*, we usually use *by far*:

- *Kristin is **the very oldest** child in the class.*
- *This is **the very lowest** price I can offer.*
- *I think watching television is **by far the most harmful** activity for a child.*
- Not: … ~~is the very most harmful activity for a child~~.

### Not before ungradable adjectives

Some adjectives are absolute, such as *dead, unique*. We do not usually use *very* before these ungradable adjectives:

- *The king was **dead**.*
- Not: *~~The king was very dead.~~*
- *He is **married**.*
- Not: *~~He is very married.~~*

Adjectives which describe an extreme quality can be modified by *absolutely, completely, really* and *totally* but not normally with *very*. Some common examples are:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>amazing</i></td><td><i>excellent</i></td><td><i>horrified</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>awful</i></td><td><i>exceptional</i></td><td><i>huge</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>brilliant</i></td><td><i>fantastic</i></td><td><i>perfect</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>delighted</i></td><td><i>furious</i></td><td><i>stunning</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>essential</i></td><td><i>horrible</i></td><td><i>terrible</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

- *Her dress was **absolutely** stunning.*
- Not: *~~Her dress was very stunning~~*.

- *That singer is **really** awful.*
- Not: *~~That singer is very awful~~*.

- *It is a **really** fantastic film.*
- Not: *~~It is a very fantastic film~~*.

## Not very

We can use *not very* to soften a negative comment:

- *Ray is usually **not very** punctual.* (more direct: *Ray is always late*.)
- *This pasta is**n’t*** ***very** nice, is it?* (more direct: *This pasta is not nice*.)
