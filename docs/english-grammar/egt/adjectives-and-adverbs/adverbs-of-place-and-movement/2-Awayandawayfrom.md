# Away and away from

*Away* is an adverb. *Away from* is a multi-word preposition.

## Away

We most commonly use *away* to mean ‘from here to another place’ or ‘disappearing from sight’:

- *Please go **away** and leave her alone.*
- *He walked **away** without saying anything.*
- *The floods were really serious this year but most of the high water has flowed **away** now.*

*Away* can also mean ‘not present’ or ‘not here’:

- *She’s **away** at the moment but can I get her to ring you when she returns?*

*Away* can refer to ‘the length of time from the time of speaking’ or to ‘the distance from a place’. It comes after the time or distance phrase:

- *The children are getting very excited cos our trip to China is only a week **away**.*
- *The start of the football season is two months **away** but everyone still keeps talking about football.*
- *The town is only three miles **away**.*

## Away from

When we talk about the distance between two places, we can use *far away from*:

- *We’re now in Rome. How **far away from** Rome is Naples?* (the same as: *How far is Rome from Naples?*)

We sometimes use *away from the office* meaning ‘not in’. It is commonly used in email auto-replies:

- \[out-of-office auto-reply on an email\]
- *I am **away from** the office until next Tuesday (Sept 21st) and will answer your email as soon as possible after that date.*

We can use *away from* to refer to movement:

- *As he drove **away from** her house, he felt sad.*
