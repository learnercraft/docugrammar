# Outside

*Outside* is an adverb, an adjective, a preposition or a noun.

We use *outside* as an adverb or an adjective to mean ‘not in a building’:

- *It was sunny **outside**, but not very warm.* (adverb)
- *It’s a bit dark at night. We could put an **outside** light there.* (adjective)

*Outside* can also mean ‘external’, not part of an existing plan or situation:

- *They’re calling on **outside** investors for more support.*

We use *outside* or *outside of* as a preposition to mean ‘not in a particular place, but near it’:

- *There’s a chair just **outside** the room opposite.*
- *She works in a software development company just **outside of** Dublin.*

As a preposition, we also use *outside* or *outside of* to mean ‘anywhere else apart from a particular place’:

- *There is a weight limit of 750g for letters **outside** Europe.*

*Outside of* can also be used with time expressions to mean ‘excluding’ or ‘apart from’:

- ***Outside of*** *the summer months, the hotel rates are lower.*

*Outside* as a noun is used to refer to the exterior of something. It is more informal than *exterior*:

- *The **outside** of the house is not very attractive, but inside it is beautiful.* (or, more formal, *The exterior of the house …*)
