# Nearby

*Nearby* is an adverb or an adjective meaning ‘not far away’:

- *Does Paul live **nearby**?* (adverb)
- *Luckily, the **nearby** buildings weren’t damaged by the fire.* (adjective)

We don’t use *nearby* as a preposition. We use *near*:

- *He worked in a restaurant **near** the station.*
- Not: *~~He worked in a restaurant nearby the station.~~*
