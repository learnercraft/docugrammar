# No longer, not any longer

We use *no longer* or *not any longer* to talk about the end of an action or state. *No longer* is more formal:

- *One day I could stand it **no longer**.*
- *I could**n’t** stand it **any*** ***longer**. I walked out and didn’t go back.*

*No longer* often comes in the normal mid position for adverbs (between the subject and main verb, or after the modal verb or first auxiliary verb, or after *be* as a main verb), especially in more formal styles:

- *She **no longer** wears the dull colours of her former life and now dresses in bright, fashionable clothes.*

In very formal styles, we can use *no longer* in front position, with the subject and verb inverted:

- ***No longer*** *does he dream of becoming famous. He knows his life will be very ordinary.*

*No longer* or *not any longer* are the opposite of *still*.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>She </i><b><i>no longer</i></b><i> works here.</i><i>She does</i><b><i>n’t</i></b><i> work here </i><b><i>any longer</i></b><i>.</i></td><td>She isn’t working here now.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>She </i><b><i>still</i></b><i> works here.</i></td><td>She is working here now.</td></tr></tbody></table>

We use *Not any longer* as a response on its own. However, we don’t use *No longer* as a response on its own:

- A: *Are you still living in London?*
- B: ***Not any longer***.
- Not: *~~No longer~~. or ~~No, not still~~*.
