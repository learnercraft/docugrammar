## Writing: any more or anymore?

In British English we usually write the adverb *any more* as two words though we sometimes see it as one word, especially in American English. We never write it as one word as a determiner:

- *I’m not cold **any more**.* (or *I’m not cold* ***anymore***.)
- *I can’t print **any more** copies. The printer isn’t working.*
- Not: *~~I can’t print anymore copies.~~*

- *No longer*, *not any longer*
