# Usually

The adverb *usually* refers to what typically or normally happens. We use it mostly in mid position, between the subject and the main verb, or after the modal verb or first auxiliary verb, or after *be* as a main verb:

- *Children **usually** enjoy visits to the zoo.*
- Not: *~~Children enjoy usually visits~~* …
- *I **usually** get up around eight o’clock.*
- *You can **usually** buy tickets for rock concerts on the Internet.*
- *Are you **usually** in your office on Thursdays?*

:::warning

*Usually* does not mean the same as *used to* or *be used to*. *Usually* refers to what typically or normally happens. *Used to* refers to things which were true in the past but not now. *Be used to* means ‘be accustomed to’ or ‘be familiar with’:

- *We **usually** watch the news on TV before we go to bed.*
- Not: *~~We used to watch the news~~ … or ~~We’re used to watching the news~~ … or ~~We use to watch the news~~* …

We can also use the verb *tend* to talk about what usually happens:

- *We **tend** to watch the news on TV before we go to bed.*

:::

We say *as usual*, not *as usually*, to talk about something which happens in the normal or typical way:

- *We shall meet again **as usual** at 5 pm next Tuesday.*
- Not: *~~We shall meet again as usually at~~* …

## Typical errors

Take care to spell *usually* with *ll*.

Don’t confuse *usually* and *used to*. *Usually* refers to what normally happens; *used to* refers to things which were true in the past but are no longer true:

- *I **usually** play football on Wednesday evenings, so Thursday would be better for me to go out for a meal.*
- Not: *~~I used to play football~~* …
