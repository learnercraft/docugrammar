# Ago

The adverb *ago* refers to a period of time that is completed and goes from a point in the past up to now. *Ago* follows expressions of time:

- *It happened **a long time ago**.*
- *They arrived in Athens **six weeks ago**.*
- Not: *~~They arrived in Athens ago six weeks.~~*

:::warning

We normally use *ago* with the past simple. We donâ€™t use it with the present perfect:

- *I **received** his letter four days **ago**.*
- Not: *~~I have received his letter four days ago.~~*

:::

If we refer to a point in time before a specific time in the past, we use *before* or *earlier* or *previously*, often with the past perfect:

- *We **had got** their invitation four days **before**.*
- *They met on the same island where they **had met** ten years **previously**.*

If we refer to how long something lasted, we use *for* (not *ago*):

- *When I was at school, I studied Russian **for** five years.* (my studies lasted for five years)
