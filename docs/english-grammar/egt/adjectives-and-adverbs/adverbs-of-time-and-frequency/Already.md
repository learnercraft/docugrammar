# Already

*Already* is an adverb.

## Already: meaning

We use *already* to emphasise that something was completed before something else happened. It is often used with the present perfect or past perfect:

- *The plane **had already landed** when the pilot announced that there would be a delay in getting to the gate.*

*Already* is also used to show surprise about things that have happened or will have happened earlier than we expected.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>It’s twelve o’clock.</i></td><td>I am not surprised that it’s twelve o’clock.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>It’s twelve o’clock </i><b><i>already</i></b><i>.</i></td><td>I’m surprised. I thought it was earlier.</td></tr></tbody></table>

We use it in affirmative sentences and questions but not usually in negatives:

- *There are **already** about ten people here.* (that’s more than were expected at this time)
- Not: *~~There aren’t already any people here.~~*

- A: *Are you back **already**?* (A is surprised that B has returned so soon.)
- B: *Yeah*.

## Already: position

### Mid position

We usually put *already* in the normal mid position for adverbs (between the subject and the main verb, or after the modal verb or first auxiliary verb, or after *be* as a main verb):

- *We **already** knew that he was coming to visit.*
- *His family had **already** heard the news.*
- *Joe’s **already** here, so we can begin.*

:::warning

We don’t use *already* between a verb and a direct object:

- *I’ve **already** made the coffee.*
- Not: *~~I’ve made already the coffee.~~*

:::

### End position

We can use *already* at the end of a sentence for greater emphasis or to show greater surprise. This is especially common in informal speaking:

- *Gosh, he’s finished painting the kitchen **already**!* (end position is more emphatic)
- *Have you booked a flight **already**?*

### Front position

Less often, we put *already* in front position (before the subject). This is usually more formal:

- ***Already*** *more than fifty thousand tickets have been sold for Saturday’s cup final match.*

We don’t often put *already* in front position in informal speaking.

## Already: typical errors

We don’t use the past simple with *already* for something which was completed before something else happened. Instead, we use the past perfect.

- *Their wedding in Rome was cancelled but we had **already** booked our flights and hotel, so we decided to go.*
- Not: … ~~but we already booked our flights and hotel~~ …

You may hear American English speakers using *already* with the past simple.

We don’t use *already* between the verb and its object.

- *I’ve **already** \[verb\] drunk \[object\] three coffees today!*
- Not: *~~I’ve drunk already three coffees~~*
