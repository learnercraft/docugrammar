# Early

*Early* is an adverb or an adjective.

*Early* means ‘near the beginning of a period of time or event’. The comparative and superlative forms are *earlier* and *earliest*. We most commonly use *early* as an adverb:

- *We’ll have to get up **early** to catch the flight.* (early in the morning)
- *The meeting’s now taking place in March, two months **earlier**.*

*Early* can also be used as an adjective:

- \[talking about a famous composer\]
- *His **early** music was written mainly for children.*
- *His **earliest** memories were of life in Brazil.*

*Early* as an adverb can also mean ‘before the time that was expected’:

- *You’re **early**. We haven’t had breakfast yet.*

## Typical error

We don’t use *early* to mean ‘a short time after now’ or ‘a short time after then’. We use *soon*:

- *Let’s meet **soon**.*
- Not: *~~Let’s meet early.~~*

- *They had only been in Greece for a week but they **soon** learned to speak a few words of the local language.*
- Not: … ~~but they early learned to speak a few words~~ …
