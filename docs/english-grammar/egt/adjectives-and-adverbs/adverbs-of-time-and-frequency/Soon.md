# Soon

*Soon* means ‘a short time after now’ and ‘a short time after a point in the past’. Like many other short adverbs, we can use it in front position, mid position or end position, though we don’t use it in end position when referring to the past:

- *The summer is coming. **Soon** the tourists will arrive.* (front position)
- *She **soon** realised her mistake and apologised to us all.* (mid position)
- *I was sorry to hear you are not well. I hope you get better **soon**.* (end position, future reference)
- A: *Bye bye*.
- B: *Bye. See you* ***soon***. (end position, future reference)
- *The ticket office opened at 8 am, and all the tickets were **soon** sold out.* (or *The ticket office opened at 8 am, and **soon** all the tickets were sold out*.)
- Not: … ~~were sold out soon.~~

We can use *very* or *quite* before *soon*:

- *The construction is planned to start **very*** (or ***quite***) ***soon** – next month in fact*.

## Soon or early?

*Soon* does not mean the same as *early*.

## Soon or quickly?

:::warning

*Soon* does not mean the same as *quickly*:

- *I hope to see you **soon** to tell you more about it.*
- Not: *~~I hope to see you quickly~~* …

## Soon after

Warning:

We can use *soon* before *after* or *afterwards*:

- *Sharon arrived first, and Mena arrived* ***soon after*** (or ***soon afterwards***).

:::

## As soon as …

*As soon as* … is a common phrase. We can follow it by the adjective *possible*, or by a clause:

- *The bridge must be repaired **as soon as** possible. It’s dangerous.*
- *Come and see us **as soon as** you can.*
- *Fill in the form and return it **as soon as** you receive it.*
