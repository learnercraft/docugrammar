# Still

*Still* is an adverb and an adjective.

## Still as an adverb

We use *still* as an adverb to emphasise that something is continuing:

- *They have been together for 40 years and they are **still** very much in love.*
- *We’re **still** waiting for our new couch to be delivered.*

We usually put *still* in the normal mid position for adverbs (between the subject and the main verb, or after the modal verb or first auxiliary verb, or after *be* as a main verb):

- *She **still** goes to French classes every week.* (between subject and main verb)
- *He’s **still** studying.* (after the modal verb or first auxiliary verb)
- *I’m **still** hungry.* (after main verb *be*)

Spoken English:

In informal speaking, you will often hear *still* used in end position. Many speakers of English may consider this usage too informal:

- *I can’t find my bag **still**. Has anyone seen it?*
- *Have you got their address **still**?*

The opposite of *still* is *no longer, not any longer* or *not any more*:

- A: *Are you still teaching in Birmingham*?
- B: *No, I’m not working there **any more*** (or ***any longer***). (or *No, I’m* ***no*** ***longer** working there*.)
- Not: *~~I’m not still working~~* …

We sometimes use *still* to show that the continuing situation is not desired or is surprising, especially when *still* is stressed and in a negative clause. Note the position of *still* before the auxiliary or modal verb when we use it in a negative clause:

- *She bought a car two months ago and she **still** hasn’t taken any driving lessons.* (*still* is stressed)
- *I **still** can’t find Kay’s phone number.* (*still* is stressed) (I’ve been looking for it for a long time. I wish I could find it.)

We can also use *still* stressed in this way for something that is true in spite of other things:

- *We offered £350,000 for the flat but they **still** wanted more.*
- *We were near the front of the queue but we **still** didn’t get tickets for the concert.*

We can use *still* in front position to mean ‘on the other hand’ or ‘nevertheless’:

- *I don’t really like weddings. **Still**, I’ll have to go or they’ll be offended.*
- *… there was not one air-conditioned room on the tour and there were not enough minibuses for all the passengers. **Still**, I did manage to get into one minibus but it broke down on the way to the hotel.*

## Still as an adjective

We use *still* as an adjective to say that something is not moving:

We don’t use *still* after the main verb:

*Teachers **still** have an important role in the classroom.*

Not: *~~Teachers have still an important role~~* …

We don’t use *still* before the first auxiliary or modal verb in an affirmative clause:

- Not: … ~~still is going up~~.

- *I can **still** run 5 km without difficulty.*
- Not: *~~I still can run~~* …
