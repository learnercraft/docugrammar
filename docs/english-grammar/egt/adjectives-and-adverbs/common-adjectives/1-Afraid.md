# Afraid

## Afraid meaning ‘feeling fear’

*Afraid* as an adjective means ‘feeling fear’. We use it with *of* + noun, *of* + *\-ing* form, a *to-*infinitive or a *that*\-clause:

- *Are you **afraid** of the dark?* (*of* + noun)
- *She seemed **afraid** of walking home alone.* (*of* + -ing form)
- *If you don’t understand, don’t be **afraid** to ask.* (*to*\-infinitive)
- *They looked **afraid** that we might get lost in the city centre.* (*that*\-clause)

:::warning

We only use *afraid* after a verb such as *be, seem, become*, not before a noun (predicatively):

- *Her mother is very ill and **afraid**.*
- Not: *~~Her afraid mother~~*

## Afraid: softening

We also use *to be afraid* in phrases such as *afraid that, afraid to say*, *afraid not* and *afraid so* when we want to soften statements to avoid saying something too directly. We often use these expressions to respond to bad news, or when we are sorry about something. *Be afraid not* and *be afraid so* are only used as responses:

- *I’m **afraid that** we can’t agree to your proposal.*
- A: *Is it right that she has resigned?*
- B: *We’re **afraid to say** she has*.
- A: *Did your team win?*
- B: *I’m* ***afraid not***.
- A: *Is the shop closed?*
- B: *I’m* ***afraid so***.
