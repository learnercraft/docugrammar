# Hard

*Hard* is both an adjective and an adverb. When it is an adverb, it means ‘needing or using a lot of physical or mental effort’. It goes after the main verb:

- *I studied **hard** for my exams but didn’t do very well.*
- *We have worked **hard** all day.*

The comparative and superlative forms are *harder* and *hardest*:

- *He didn’t get into the team this year. He’ll just have to try **harder** next time.*
- Not: *~~He’ll just have to try more hard next time.~~*
- *Right, children, who has worked **hardest** today?*

:::warning

Don’t confuse *hard* with *hardly*. *Hardly* usually means ‘only just’ or ‘almost not’:

- *Every day I ran a lot and worked **hard** so that I would be prepared for the game.*
- Not: *~~Every day I ran a lot and worked hardly.~~*
