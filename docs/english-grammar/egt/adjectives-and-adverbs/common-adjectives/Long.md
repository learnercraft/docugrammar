# Long

*Long* is an adjective or an adverb.

We can use *long* to talk about time, distance or length.

### Time

We use *long* as an adverb in questions and negative clauses to talk about duration:

- A: *How **long** has Valerie been staying with you?*
- B: *She arrived in January, so she’s been here for four months*.
- *Marco didn’t stay **long** at the party.*
- *Don’t be **long**.*

:::warning

We don’t use *long* on its own in affirmative clauses. We often use (*for*) *a long time*:

- *We waited **for a long time** in the rain for the bus.*
- Not: … ~~waited long~~ …

- *They took **a long time** getting here.*
- Not: *~~They took long~~* …

:::

We can use *long* in affirmative clauses with *too*, *enough* and *so*:

- *A month is **too long** to wait for an appointment.*
- *We’ve waited **long enough** for a reply. I think we need to phone them.*
- *You took **so long**. What were you doing?*

When we talk about actual amounts of time, we can use phrases with time + *long*, or phrases like *all day long, all month long*:

- *The lecture was **three hours long**.*
- *We worked **all day long**.*

We can also use *a long time ago*, *long ago* or *long before* to refer to a time many years in the past:

- *This castle was built **a long time ago**.* (or … *was built* ***long ago***.)
- ***Long before*** *you were born, there was a factory here. It was closed in the 1960s.*

We use *long* as an adjective:

- *You’re home already. That can’t have been a very **long** film.*

### Distance

We can use the phrase *a long way* to talk about distance:

- *My house is **a long way** from the station. You’ll have to take a taxi.*
- *It’s **a long way** to the nearest petrol station.*

In negative statements and questions we usually use *far*:

- *My house is not **far** from the station.*
- *Is it **far** to the beach?*

### Length

We use *long* to talk about the length of something:

- *It was three metres **long** and four metres wide.*
- *How **long** is the boat?*
- *This is such a **long** queue. It’s going to take at least an hour.*

## As long as

The phrase *as long as* is used as a conjunction. It means ‘on condition that’:

- ***As long as*** *the weather is okay, we’re going to paint the house tomorrow.*
- *Jenny said she’d come to the party **as long as** we don’t stay too late.*

## No longer and not any longer

We can use the phrases *no longer* and *not … any longer* to refer to something that used to exist or happen but does not exist or happen now:

- *There are **no longer** any family bakeries in our town.*
- A: *Are you still working at the garden centre?*
- B: *No*, ***not any longer***.

- *Any more* or *anymore*?

## Typical error

We can’t use *long* on its own in affirmative sentences:

- A: *Will it take* ***long?***
- B: *No, it won’t take* ***long***. (or *Yes, it’ll take* ***a long time***.)
- Not: *~~Yes, it’ll take long.~~*
