# Same, similar, identical

*Same* means that two or more things are exactly like one another. We can use *same* as an adjective before a noun or as a pronoun. When we use *same* to compare people or things, we must use it with *the*:

- *I noticed that Richard and I were both wearing **the same** jacket.*
- Not: … ~~were both wearing same jacket.~~
- *These two colours are not **the same**. This one is slightly lighter than that one.*
- Not: … ~~are not same.~~

### The same as

:::warning

*The same* is followed by *as*. It is not followed by *that* or *than*:

- *Does ‘start’ mean **the same as** ‘begin’ in English?*
- Not: … ~~the same that~~ … or … ~~the same than~~ …
- *My new car is **the same** model **as** my old one.*
- Not: … ~~the same model that~~ … or … ~~the same model than~~ …

:::

### The same \+ noun + clause

When we use *the same* with a noun, we can follow it by a clause with *that*, and less commonly with *who* or *which*. We can often leave out *that*, *who* or *which*:

- *She’s **the same** person (**that**) I spoke to when I phoned their office.*
- *How was the course? Was it **the same** teacher (**who**) you had last time?*

We can emphasise *same* with *very*:

- *This is **the very same** hotel we stayed at when we were here twenty years ago!*

### Do the same

We can use *do the same* instead of repeating a clause:

- *She bought her ticket for the folk festival online, and we **did the same**.* (We also bought our tickets online.)

## Similar and identical

We use *similar* if two or more things are not entirely the same, or *identical* if two or more things are exactly the same. We use the patterns *similar to* and *identical to, a similar* + noun or *a similar* + *one* and *an identical* + noun or *an identical* + *one*. We don’t say *a same*:

- *This colour is **similar to** that one.*
- *Frank had a problem connecting his printer. We had **a similar** problem, so it must be the software.*
- Not: … ~~a same problem~~ …
- *She first showed us a beautiful 16th-century vase. Then she showed us **an*** ***identical one**, but the second one was a copy.*
- Not: … ~~a same one~~ …
- *Questions 1 and 2 were **identical**.*
