# Likely and unlikely

*Likely* and *unlikely* are adjectives. We use them to say that something will probably happen or not happen in the future. We can use them before a noun, or with the verbs *be, seem* and *appear*:

- *What is the most **likely** outcome of the referendum?*
- *It seems **unlikely** that inflation will fall below 3% this year.*

We can follow *likely* or *unlikely* by a verb in the *to-*infinitive form:

- *The economy is **likely** to recover slowly after the long recession.*
- *Are you **likely** to want this cardboard box or shall I throw it out?*
- *The weather seems **unlikely** to change over the next few days.*

Instead of *unlikely*, we can say *not likely*:

- *Zoe’s **not likely** to arrive before eight o’clock. She doesn’t finish work till seven.*

We can also follow *likely* and *unlikely* by a *that*\-clause with *will*. This pattern is less common than *likely/unlikely + to-*infinitive:

- *It is **likely** that there will be a general election next year.* or *There is **likely** to be a general election next year.*
- *It seems **unlikely** that space travel for ordinary people will become common in the near future.*

We can use adverbs such as *very*, *quite*, *highly* and *extremely* before *likely* and *unlikely* to make their meaning stronger:

- *The government is **very likely** to propose changes to the income tax system soon.*
- *I think it’s **highly unlikely** that she’ll get into university with the test scores she has.*

We can compare how probable different things are using *likely* and *unlikely* with *as … as*, *more, (the) most, less* and *(the) least*:

- *Steve is **as likely** to get the job **as** Dora. They’re both very well qualified.*
- *People are **more likely** to take climate change seriously if they can understand the economic consequences for their own lives.*
- *Kevin is **(the) least likely** to want to get married of all his friends.*

In American English, and more and more in British English, *likely* is used as a mid-position adverb (like *probably* in British English), most commonly between *will* and a main verb:

- *The new regulations **will likely** result in many people losing their jobs.*

## Typical error

*It is likely to* does not mean the same as *it is easy to*:

- *It’s **easy** to forget to save your work on the computer.*
- Not: *~~It’s likely to forget~~* …
- *It’s **easy** to confuse mushrooms you can eat with poisonous ones.*
- Not: *~~It’s likely to confuse~~* …
