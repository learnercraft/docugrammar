# Even

*Even* is an adverb.

We use *even* to refer to something surprising, unexpected, unusual or extreme:

- *He didn’t **even** have enough money to pay the rent.*
- *You love me, **even** after the terrible things I’ve done?*
- *I’d never been abroad before, so it was a wonderful gift. I didn’t have to pay for anything. When we got to the airport at Stansted, she’d **even** arranged for the captain to escort me on to the plane. It was a treat I will always remember.*

## Even: position

When *even* refers to a whole clause or sentence, we usually put it in the normal mid position for adverbs, between the subject and the main verb, after the modal verb or first auxiliary verb, or after *be* as a main verb:

- *You can take an online course now and you **even** do the test online.*
- *I haven’t **even** started making dinner.*
- *It’s a really useful book if you’re interested in cameras. There’s **even** a chapter on buying second-hand ones.*

We can put *even* or *not even* before the part of the clause or sentence we want to focus on:

- ***Even*** *a five-year-old can see that these figures don’t add up.*
- *They came in cars, in lorries, and **even** an aeroplane.*
- \[talking about a local swimming pool\]
- *It’s not usually too busy. Not **even** at weekends.*

We sometimes put *even* at the end of a clause or sentence in informal speaking.

## Even and comparatives

We often use *even* with comparative adjectives and adverbs to add more emphasis:

- *It is six years since U2 played in Belfast in 1987 on their world-conquering Joshua Tree tour. Since then they have become **even** bigger and richer, and their concerts **even** more popular.*
- \[talking about a footballer\]
- *Frank played well last season and this season he has played **even** better.*

***Even*** and ***also***

*Even* and *also* are both adverbs.

We use *even* to add emphasis or more information to a surprising or unexpected thing:

- *Human beings, we are told, will live for 150, **even** 200 years, by the end of the century.*

We use *also* to add a new piece of information, without the suggestion that it is surprising:

- *She was a very beautiful girl. She was **also** very bright and excelled at everything she did.*
- Not: *~~She was even very bright~~* …

## Even though and even if

We can use *even* with *though* and *if*.

*Even though* means the same as *although*, ‘in spite of the fact that’. We use it to say that something may not be what we expect. *Even though* gives more emphasis than *although*:

- \[talking about a football team\]
- *I think they’re fantastic, **even though** they haven’t won any games this season.*

We use *even* before *if* to refer to a possible unexpected or extreme event:

- *I’m still going to go swimming in the sea **even if** it rains.* (I don’t expect rain but it is possible.)
- *I’ve got to get home **even if** it means flying the plane myself.* (I’ve got to get home and I’ll do anything to get there.)

- *If*

## Even so

We use *even so* to make a contrast, to mean ‘despite something’. It has a similar meaning to *however* or *nevertheless*.

It is most common in front position in the clause but we can also use it in end position. It often occurs after *but*:

- *Their holiday went well but, **even so**, they longed to be home again with the children.*
- \[parent to child, getting into a car\]
- *You do need your seatbelt on. Put it on please. I know it’s not very far, but **even so**. If we have an accident you’ll need it.*
- *I know you don’t like her, but you should say hello to her **even so**.*
