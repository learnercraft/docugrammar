# Too

*Too* is an adverb.

## Too meaning ‘more than enough’

We use *too* meaning ‘more than enough’ in different positions.

### Too before adjectives and adverbs

We use *too* immediately before adjectives and adverbs:

- *This coffee is **too** sweet.*
- Not: *~~This coffee is too much sweet~~*.
- *I can’t sleep. It’s **too** hot.*
- *It happened **too** quickly, so I just didn’t see it.*
- Not: *~~It happened too much quickly~~*.
- *The car was travelling **too** fast and went out of control.*

### Too before adjective/adverb + to\-infinitive

- *The water was **too*** ***cold to swim** in.*
- *Two hours is **too*** ***long to wait**.*

### Too much, too many, too few and too little

When we want to talk about quantities which are more or less than enough, we use *too much, too many, too few* and *too little* before a noun:

- *There’s* ***too much salt in this soup.*** (*too much* + uncountable noun)
- *There were **too many** dogs on the beach.* (*too many* + countable noun)
- *I don’t like this book because there are **too few** pictures in it.* (*too few* + countable noun; more formal than *I don’t like this book because there aren’t enough pictures in it*.)
- *The trip was cancelled because there was **too little** interest in it.* (*too little* + uncountable noun)

### Much too and far too

We can use *much* and *far* with *too* for emphasis. *Far too* is stronger than *much too*:

### Too and very

We use *very* to add emphasis to an adjective or an adverb, but it does not mean the same as *too*.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>She is </i><b><i>very</i></b><i> careful.</i></td><td><i>Very makes careful stronger.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>She is </i><b><i>too</i></b><i> careful.</i></td><td><i>Too careful</i> means ‘more careful than is necessary’.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Very much and too much

We often use *very much* to emphasise verbs such as *like, dislike, hope, doubt*. We do not use *too much* in this way with these verbs:

- *I like it **very much** because I got it from my husband.*
- Not: *~~I like it too much~~* …

- *I doubt **very much** that Ronan will be able to come to the party.*
- Not: *~~I doubt too much that~~* …

### Too bad

Spoken English:

In speaking, we can use *too bad* or *that’s too bad* as a response token to express that we are sorry to hear about something. This is particularly common in American English:

- A: *The weather forecast says it’s going to rain again on Wednesday*.
- B: ***Too bad***. *We were planning to go for a picnic*.
- A: *How’s your mother?*
- B: *She’s okay but she’s feeling lonely because she lives on her own now*.
- A: ***That’s too bad***. *Does she have many friends living nearby?*

## Too meaning ‘also’

We can use *too* to mean ‘also’. It is more common than *also* in informal situations. We normally use it at the end of the clause:

- \[in a restaurant, A is the waiter\]
- A: *Have you decided?*
- B: *I think I’ll have the soup*.
- C: *I’ll have that* ***too***.
- *Catherine decided to join us for dinner, and her husband came along **too**.* (or, more formal, *… and her husband also came along*.)

In short answers in informal situations, we normally say *me too*, not *I too*:

- A: *I love that colour*.
- B: ***Me too***.

In more formal situations, we can use *too* immediately after the subject:

- *You **too** could have a week in the sun. Visit www.holidaysforyou.com.*

- *Also*, *as well* or *too*?

## Typical error

We don’t use *too* to emphasise adjectives and adverbs. We use *very*:

- *She was **very** beautiful.* (*very* emphasises *beautiful*)
- Not: *~~She was too beautiful.~~*
