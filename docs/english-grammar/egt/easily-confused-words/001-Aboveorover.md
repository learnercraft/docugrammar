# Above or over?

When we use a*bove* as a preposition, it means ‘higher than’. Its meaning is close to that of the preposition *over*. In the following sentences, *over* can be used instead of *above*:

- *The waves came up **above** her head and she started screaming.* (or … *came up **over** her head* …)
- *She is a nervous flier. But once the plane got **above** the clouds, she started to relax.* (or … *got **over** the clouds …*)

We use *above*, but not *over*, to refer to things that are at an upper or higher level:

- \[a ‘chalet’ is a small wooden building usually found in mountainous areas\]
- *Do they live in that chalet **above** the village?*
- Not: *~~Do they live in that chalet over the village?~~*

We usually use *above*, but not *over*, when there is no contact between the things referred to. *Over* or *on top of* have a more general meaning, and can be used when one thing touches or covers another:

- *They made her comfortable and put a blanket **over** her.*
- Not: *~~They made her comfortable and put a blanket above her.~~*

We normally use *over* not *above* with numbers:

- *I get **over** sixty emails a day.*
- Not: *~~I get above sixty emails a day.~~*
- *If you weigh **over** 100 kilograms, then you may need to start a diet.*
- Not: *~~If you weigh above 100 kilograms~~*

:::warning

When we talk about temperatures in relation to *zero* or (*the) average*, we use *above* not *over*:

- *It was three degrees **above** zero.*
- Not: *~~It was three degrees over zero.~~*

:::

When we refer to temperatures in other contexts, we can normally use *above* or *over*:

- *The temperature is already **above** 30 degrees.* (or … ***over*** *30 degrees*.)

## Typical errors

We don’t use *over* to mean ‘higher level’.

- *Most of the race is 500 metres **above** sea level.*
- Not: *~~Most of the race is 500 metres over sea level.~~*

We don’t use *above* when one thing touches or covers another.

- *Pour some cream* ***over the tart and serve it warm.***
- Not: *~~Pour some cream above the tart~~*

We don’t use *above* with numbers.

- ***Over*** *100 people complained about the programme.*
- Not: *~~Above 100 people complained~~*
