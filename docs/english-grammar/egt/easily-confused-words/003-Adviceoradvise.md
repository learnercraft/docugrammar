# Advice or advise?

*Advice* /ədˈvaɪs/ is a noun and means a suggestion about what someone should do. It is uncountable:

- *Let me give you some **advice**: stay away from Margaret.*
- Not: *~~Let me give you an advice~~*

- *She gave him a lot of **advice**, but I don’t think he listened.*
- Not: …~~a lot of advices~~ …

If we want to use *advice* in a countable way, then we use the phrase *a piece of advice*:

- *I have two **pieces of advice** for you about the holiday.*

We use the verb *advise* /ədˈvaɪz/ to mean ‘to give someone advice’:

- *I strongly **advise** you to lose weight.*
- *They finally did what we **advised**.*
