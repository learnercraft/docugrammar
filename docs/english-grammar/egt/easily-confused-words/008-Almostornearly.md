# Almost or nearly?

We use *almost* and *nearly* to refer to the progress of things, especially if we are measuring and counting things. In these examples, *almost* and *nearly* can both be used:

- \[someone has been running five miles on a running machine in a gym\]
- *Don’t give up! You’re **almost** there.*
- *It’s time for bed. It’s **nearly** 10 o’clock.*
- *Their CD has sold **almost** 90,000 copies in the last week.*
- ***Nearly*** *all my friends were in the photograph.*

We also use *almost* and *nearly* with extreme adjectives such as *perfect*, *impossible* or *frozen*:

- *That guy is **almost** impossible.*
- *The chicken is still **nearly** frozen. I thought you’d taken it out of the freezer.*

We use *almost* (but not *nearly*) to soften statements:

- *I **almost** wish I hadn’t offered to pay his fine.*

We use *almost* before *any* and before negative words such as *no*, *none*, *never*, *nobody*, *nothing*. We don’t use *nearly* in this way:

- \[describing computer software which traces the history of towns\]
- *Using this special software, you can find the history of **almost any** building.*
- *They’ve **almost no** confidence that they can use the new phone properly.*

- *She **almost never** raises her voice.*
- Not: *~~She nearly never raises her voice~~*.
