# Already, still or yet?

## Already or yet?

We use *already* to refer to something which has happened or may have happened before the moment of speaking. *Already* can sometimes suggest surprise on the part of the speaker, that something is unexpected:

- *Is it seven o’clock **already**?* (The speaker didn’t expect it to be so late.)

We use *yet* most commonly in questions and negatives, to talk about things which are expected but which have not happened:

- *Is it seven o’clock **yet**?* (The speaker thinks that probably it’s almost seven o’clock.)
- A: *Where will you be staying?*
- B: *I have**n’t** decided* ***yet***, *but somewhere in the city centre*.

*Already* refers to things which have happened or which people think may have happened. *Yet* refers to things which have not happened or which people think may not have happened.

## Already, yet or still?

We use *still* not *yet* or *already* to refer to the continuation of a situation:

- *I **still** meet my friends from my schooldays now and then.* (I continue to meet my friends)
- Not: *~~I already meet my friends or I yet meet my friends~~*

## Negatives with already, still, yet

Negatives with *yet* mean that something has not happened up to now:

- *I have**n’t** spoken to Henry about the car **yet**.*

Negatives with *still* suggest that the situation should have changed, but it has not:

- *I **still** have**n’t** found my passport. I know it’s here somewhere.* (I’ve been looking for it for a long time. I should have found it by now)

:::warning

We usually put *yet* after the main verb, whereas we usually put *still* after the subject.
