# As or like?

*As* and *like* are prepositions or conjunctions. The prepositions *as* and *like* have different meanings. *As* + noun means ‘in the role of’, *like* + noun means ‘similar to’ or ‘in the same way as’.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>As</i></b><i> your father, I’ll help you as much as I can.</i></td><td>The speaker is the listener’s father.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>Like</i></b><i> your father, I’ll help you as much as I can.</i></td><td>The speaker is not the father but wishes to act in a similar way to the father.</td></tr></tbody></table>

We use *like* (but not *as*) to compare two things:

- *She’s got a headache **like** me.*
- Not: *~~She’s got a headache as me.~~*

- ***Like*** *the other students, he finds it a bit difficult to get to lectures early in the morning.*
- Not: *~~As the other students, he finds it~~* …

When we compare appearance or behaviour, we use *like*, not *as*:

- *That house looks **like** a castle.*
- Not: *~~That house looks as a castle.~~*

*As* is commonly used to talk about jobs:

- *He worked for a long time **as** a teacher in Africa.*
- Not: … ~~like a teacher in Africa.~~

The conjunctions *as* and *like* have the same meaning when used in comparisons. *Like* is a little more informal.

- *Nobody understands him **as** I do.*
- *Nobody understands him **like** I do.*
