# Begin or start?

We can use the verbs *begin* and *start* to mean the same thing but *begin* is more formal than *start. Begin* is an irregular verb. Its past simple form is *began* and its *\-ed* form is *begun*:

- *When did you **begin** learning English?*
- *The meeting didn’t **start** until 9 pm.*

We use *start*, but not *begin*, to talk about machines:

- *Press this button **to start** the printer.*
- Not: …~~to begin the printer.~~

- *The lawnmower won’t **start**.* (this means that it doesn’t work)
- Not: *~~The lawnmower won’t begin.~~*

*Start*, but not *begin*, is used to talk about creating a new business:

- *She **started** a new restaurant and it’s been going really well.*
- Not: *~~She began a new restaurant~~* …
