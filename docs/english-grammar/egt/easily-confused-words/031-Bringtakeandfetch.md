# Bring, take and fetch

## Bring

*Bring* means moving something or someone. The movement is either from where the listener is to where the speaker is, or from the speaker to the listener. *Bring* is an irregular verb. Its past tense and -*ed* form are both *brought*.

In both of the following examples, the speakers are seeing things from A’s viewpoint – things will move to the place where A is:

- A: *Are you going to the bedroom?*
- B: *Yes*.
- A: *Can you **bring** me my grey sweater?* *It’s on the bed*.
- B: *Yeah*. (B will return with the sweater to the place where A is.)
- Not: *~~Can you take me my grey sweater?~~*
- A: *Are you coming to our place on Friday night?*
- B: *Yes. Do you want me to **bring** my guitar?* (B will carry the guitar to the place where A will be.)

*Bring* can also mean moving with something or someone from another place to the speaker’s or listener’s location:

- \[on the telephone\]
- A: *Did Laura **bring** you anything for your birthday?*
- B: *Yes. She **brought** me some flowers and a CD*. (Laura is C, another person, in a different place from A or B. She moved with something to where B, the listener, was.)

## Take

*Take* means movement with something or someone from where the speaker or listener is to a different place:

- \[university assistant at a central faculty office, speaking to a student\]
- *You have to fill in this form and then **take** it to the English Department to get it stamped.* (the assistant and the student are at the central faculty office – the English Department is a different place)
- Not: … ~~and then bring it to the English Department~~

- A: *I can **take** you to the station tomorrow. What time’s your train?* (Neither A nor B is at the station; it is a different place.)
- B: *Thanks. It’s eight-thirty*.

## Fetch

*Fetch* means to go to another place to get something or someone and return with the thing or the person. We use it for people and things that are not here but that we need or are due to be here. We can usually use *get* instead of *fetch*:

- *If you’re going to the garage, can you **fetch** that green bag with the paintbrushes in it? Or Can you get that green bag …*
- *Right. It’s five o’clock. I’d better go and **fetch** my mother from the station.*

- *Come* or *go*?

## Bring, take and fetch: typical errors

We don’t use *take* when something is seen from the receiver’s viewpoint:

- A: *Are you and Josh coming to our party?*
- B: *Yeah. Sheila invited us*.
- A: *Good. Can you **bring** some CDs? We’re a bit short of music*.
- Not: *~~Can you take some CDs?~~*

*Brought* is the past tense of *bring*. *Bought* is the past tense of *buy*:

- *Angela was in Morocco and she **brought** us back a beautiful wooden tray.*
- Not: *~~and she bought us back~~* …
