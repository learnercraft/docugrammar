# Different from, different to or different than?

The adjective *different* means ‘not the same’. When we compare two or more items, it is usually followed by *from*. We also use *different to*, especially in speaking:

- *Adam is so **different from/to** his brother.*
- *This house is very **different from/to** your last one.*

In American English it is also common to say *different than*:

- *This tea tastes very **different than** the one I usually drink.* (or … *very **different from/to** the one I usually drink*)

In British English, people often say *different than* before a clause, but many speakers consider this to be incorrect:

- *His accent is **different** now **than** before he went to Australia.* (or … ***different*** *now **from** before he went to Australia*.)
