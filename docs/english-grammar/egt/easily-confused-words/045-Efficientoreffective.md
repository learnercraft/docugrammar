# Efficient or effective?

*Efficient* and *effective* are adjectives.

We use *efficient* to describe something or someone that works in a quick and organised way:

- *The new online banking system offers a convenient and **efficient** way to check your account.*
- \[extract from a reference for someone applying for a job\]
- *I have always known James to be highly competent and **efficient** in all aspects of his job.*

We use *effective* to describe something that gives you the results you want:

- *Taking this tablet is a very **effective** cure for travel sickness.*
- *In this light, the camera is more **effective** if you use the flash.*
