# End or finish?

We use the verbs *end* and *finish* in similar ways, to mean ‘come to a stop’:

- *I think that his contract **ends** this month.*
- *What time does the film **finish**?*

We use *finish* to say that we complete something that we are doing. It emphasises that the process stops within a specific period of time. *End* would not normally be used in these examples:

- *He **finished** his meal in just three minutes.*
- *If we had the right tools, we could **finish** the job by Friday this week.*
- *Her brother **finished** last in the race.*

We use *end* to say that stopping something is significant, and has a clear conclusion or shape. *Finish* wouldn’t normally be used in these examples:

- *The course of the river **ended** in a delightful harbour with small sailing boats everywhere.*
- *Many historians agree that the medieval period in Europe **ended** in the mid-sixteenth century.*
- *Verbs that **end** in -ed are usually in the past tense.*

*Finish* can be followed by the -*ing* form, but not by a *to*\-infinitive:

- *They’ve **finished playing** those computer games.*
- Not: *~~They’ve finished to play~~* …
- *I haven’t **finished drying** my hair yet.*
- Not: *~~I haven’t finished to dry~~* …

*End* cannot be followed by either a *to-*infinitive or the -*ing* form:

- *Call me when you’ve **finished writing** the report.*
- Not: *~~Call me when you’ve ended writing~~* …
