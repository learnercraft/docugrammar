# Every one or everyone?

We use *every one*, written as two words, to refer back to a noun we have already mentioned:

- *I received more than a hundred letters from him while I was away and I’ve kept **every one**.*

*Everyone*, written as one word, means ‘every person’:

- ***Everyone*** *enjoyed themselves.*

We use *every one of* before pronouns and determiners:

- *There are 107 two-letter words in the dictionary and John Catto, an Aberdeen lorry driver, knows **every one of** them.*
- *When Jenkins joined the bank, one of his first acts was to make **every one of** the bank’s employees reapply for their jobs.*
