# Except or except for?

We often use *except* and *except for* as prepositions to mean *‘*not including’ or ‘excluding’. They are followed by a noun or noun phrase or a *wh*\-clause. Both *except* and *except for* are correct after a noun:

- *I like all fruit **except (for)** oranges.* (excluding oranges)
- ***Except for*** *Louisa, who’s away in Berlin this weekend, we’ll all be at the party.*
- *She likes going to most sports events, **except** cricket matches.*

*Except* can also be used as a conjunction. We don’t use *except for* in this way:

- *The brothers are very alike, **except (that)** Mark is slightly taller than Kevin.*

*Except* and *except for* are used in similar ways to *apart* and *apart from*.
