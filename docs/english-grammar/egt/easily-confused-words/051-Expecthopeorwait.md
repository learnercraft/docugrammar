# Expect, hope or wait?

## Expect

We use *expect* to say that we believe that something will happen. We use *expect* in the following main patterns:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>expect</i> + object:</td><td><i>She’s </i><b><i>expecting</i></b><i> a second baby.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>expect</i> + <i>to</i>-infinitive:</td><td><i>We </i><b><i>expect</i></b><i> to move into our new flat next week.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>expect</i> + <i>that</i>-clause:</td><td><i>We </i><b><i>expected</i></b><i> that the guest house would have much better rooms.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>expect</i> + object + <i>to</i>-infinitive:</td><td><i>The company </i><b><i>expects</i></b><i> her to be early.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

*Expect* also means ‘think’ or ‘suppose’. When *expect* has this meaning, we do not commonly use it in the continuous form:

- A: *Will he have bought the necklace by now?*
- B: *I **expect** so*.
- Not: *~~I’m expecting so.~~*
- *I **expect** that he’ll be wearing that bright blue shirt.*
- Not: *~~I am expecting~~* …

When we expect that something will not happen or is not true, *expect* is most commonly used in a negative form:

- *I **don’t expect** she will pass the exam.* (preferred to *I expect she won’t pass* …)

## Hope

We use *hope* when we do not know whether something will happen or not but we want it to happen. We use *hope* in the following patterns:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>hope</i> + <i>to</i>-infinitive:</td><td><i>I think you were </i><b><i>hoping</i></b><i> to see your family next week.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>hope</i> + <i>that</i> clause:</td><td><i>I </i><b><i>hope</i></b><i> that your sister recovers quickly from the operation.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>hope</i> + <i>for</i>:</td><td>[parents discussing the birth of their next child]<i>We’ve already got two boys so we’re </i><b><i>hoping</i></b><i> for a girl.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

We use *hope* to express good intentions and wishes for the future:

- *I **hope** we can see each other soon.*
- Not: *~~I wish we can see each other soon.~~*

- *I **hope** you enjoy your stay in Greece.*
- Not: *~~I wish you enjoy your stay in Greece.~~*

## Wait

We use *wait* when we refer to letting time pass because we are expecting that something is going to happen. We use *wait* in the following main patterns:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>wait</i> (imperative):</td><td><i>Just </i><b><i>wait</i></b><i> here with the bags and I’ll go and get a taxi.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>wait</i> + <i>for</i>:</td><td><i>Don’t worry. I’ll </i><b><i>wait</i></b><i> for you.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>wait</i> + <i>to</i>-infinitive:</td><td><i>When the band arrived at the concert hall, a large crowd of screaming fans were </i><b><i>waiting</i></b><i> to greet them.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>wait</i> + <i>for</i> + object + <i>to</i>-infinitive:<i>They’re </i><b><i>waiting</i></b><i> for him to make up his mind and won’t do anything until he does.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Expect, hope or wait: typical errors

We don’t use *wait* or *wait for* to say that we believe that something will happen. We use *expect*:

- *People usually **expect** holidays to revive their spirits and renew their souls and they often succeed in achieving that target.*
- Not: *~~People usually wait for holidays to~~* …

We don’t use *expect* to refer to time passing when we are talking about something that we hope is going to happen:

- *I look forward very much to hearing from you soon, and I **wait** anxiously for a positive answer.*
- Not: … ~~and I expect anxiously a positive answer~~.
