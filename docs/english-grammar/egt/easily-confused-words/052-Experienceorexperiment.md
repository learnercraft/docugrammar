# Experience or experiment?

We use *experience* as a verb when something happens to us, or we feel it. It is rather formal:

- *I **experienced** a feeling of deep sadness as I entered the refugee camp.*
- *Customers have **experienced** problems in finding parking places at the mall.*

:::warning

We don’t use *live* instead of *experience*:

- *How children behave when they grow up depends on what they **experience** during early childhood.*
- Not: … ~~what they live during early childhood.~~

:::

*Experiment* as a verb means ‘try something in order to discover what it is like or to find out more about it’:

- *Scientists have **experimented** with liquids and gels in which plants can grow artificially.*
- *I wish the government would stop **experimenting** with new teaching methods for our kids every couple of years.*

:::warning

We don’t use *experiment* when we are talking about feelings or things which happen:

- *She suddenly **experienced** a sensation of homesickness.*
- Not: … ~~experimented a sensation~~ …
- *The company’s Asia branch **experienced** a sharp drop in profits in 2007.*
- Not: … ~~experimented a sharp drop~~…
