# Far or a long way?

*Far* and *a long way* both describe something at a great distance:

- *I can’t see very **far** without my glasses on.*
- *San Francisco is **a long way** from New York.*

*Far* is used mostly in negatives and questions:

- *There’s a Thai restaurant not **far** from here.*
- *How **far** is your house from the station?*

*A long way* is used mostly in affirmative statements but we also use it in questions and negatives:

- A: *How long did it take you to get here today?*
- B: *I left home at half past ten this morning*.
- A: *Six hours. That’s a long time, isn’t it?*
- B: *Yeah. It’s* ***a long way***.
- Not: *~~It’s far.~~*
- A: *We have to go to Cathy’s place first to pick her up*.
- B: *Is it **a long way** from here?*
- A: *No, it’s* *not* ***far***.

*Far* is used in affirmative statements with words such as *so*, *too, enough* and *as*. These expressions can refer to time as well as distance:

- ***So far****, we have sent four letters to the Council about the litter on the street.* (time until now)
- *Six months is **too far** ahead. The restaurant only takes bookings for up to two months in advance.*
- *Where we live is **far enough** away from the city. I don’t want to move any further away.*
- *From here, you can see **as far as** the ocean.*

*Far* is also used in comparatives to mean ‘much’:

- *The roads here are **far better** than in our country.*
- *Food costs **far more** in the UK.*

We can use *by far* before a superlative adjective to add emphasis:

- *With more than seven million people, London is **by far the biggest** city in England – the second city, Birmingham, has just over one million.*

We use the phrase *has come a long way* to mean ‘has improved or developed’:

- *Our team has **come** such **a long way**. We lost our first game 5-0!*

We can use the phrase *to be a long way off* (+ noun or -*ing* form) to refer to a long time:

- *The holidays **are a long way off**.*
- *We**’re*** ***a long way off** retiring yet, Marlene.*
