# First, firstly or at first?

## First and firstly

*First* can be an adjective or an adverb and refers to the person or thing that comes before all others in order, time, amount, quality or importance:

- *What’s the name of the **first** person who walked on the moon?* (adjective)
- *Beth always arrives **first** at meetings.* (adverb)

We often use *first*, especially in writing, to show the order of the points we want to make. When we are making lists, we can use *first* or *firstly*. *Firstly* is more formal than *first*:

- *Dear Mr Yates*
- ***First(ly)*** *I would like to thank you for your kind offer of a job …*
- Not: *~~At first I would like to thank you~~* …

- ***First(ly)*** *the sodium chloride is dissolved in the water and heated gently. Second(ly) a dye is added to the solution.*
- Not: *~~At first, the sodium chloride~~* …

## At first

*At first* means ‘at the beginning’ or ‘in the beginning’ and we use it when we make contrasts:

- ***At first*** *when I went to England to study English, I was homesick, but in the end I cried when it was time to leave.*
- *He called for help. No one heard him **at first**, but eventually two young girls came to help him.*

- *Finally*, *at last*, *lastly* or *in the end*?
