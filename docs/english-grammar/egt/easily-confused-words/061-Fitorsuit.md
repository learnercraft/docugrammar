# Fit or suit?

If something *fits* you or *fits* into a place, it is the right size or shape for you or for that place:

- \[trying on shoes in a shoe shop\]
- *These **fit** perfectly. And I like the colour. I think I’ll buy them.*
- *I’ve put on weight and my trousers don’t **fit** me anymore!*
- *Will this table **fit** into the space between the bookshelf and the wall?*

If something *suits* someone or something, it is right for that person or thing or situation, or it makes that person or thing look more attractive.

- *Wednesday at ten o’clock for the meeting **suits** me perfectly.*
- *That sofa **suits** the room really well – the colours match the walls.*
- *Black doesn’t **suit** me; I look better in lighter colours.*

:::warning

We don’t use *fit* when we mean that something is right for a person or thing or situation:

- *This restaurant **suits** people who like simple food.*
- Not: *~~This restaurant fits people~~* …
