# Full or filled?

*Full* is an adjective, and means ‘containing a lot’:

- *The theatre is completely **full** this evening.*
- *The room was **full** of books.*

*Fill* is a verb, and means ‘make or become full’. The -*ed* form is *filled*:

- *Can you **fill** this bottle with water for me?*
- *She has **filled** my life with happiness.*

We use the -*ed* form + *with* as an adjective especially in metaphorical contexts to refer to strong emotions:

- *She looked at him, **filled with** horror.*
- Not: *~~She looked at him, full of horror~~*.
