# High or tall?

We use *high* for mountains and for things which are a long way above the ground:

- *There are some **high** mountains in the north of the country.*
- *The light switch is too **high** for a child to use.*

:::warning

We don’t use *high* when we talk about people. We use *tall*:

- *Sally is very **tall** and slim – she could get a job as a model!*
- Not: Sally is very high and slim …
- ***Tall*** *people often get backache.*

:::

We use *tall* to describe things which are high and thin in their shape (e.g. buildings, trees):

- *The **tall** trees by the river give welcome shade on hot days.*
- *You know that very **tall**, white building just where the motorway begins – that’s where I work.*
