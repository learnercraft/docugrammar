# Imply or infer?

We *imply* something by what we say. We *infer* something from what somebody else says. The main difference between these two words is that a *speaker* can *imply*, but a listener can only *infer*.

When someone implies something, they put the suggestion *into* the message:

- *Are you **implying** that the team cheated?*

When someone infers something, they take the suggestion *out of* the message. In order to underline this difference, *infer* is used with the preposition *from*:

- *Then I think we must **infer from** what they said that they believe we should reapply for the job.*

## Typical error

We donâ€™t use *infer* to refer to what someone has said:

- *Are you **implying** that I cheated?*
- Not: *~~Are you inferring that I cheated?~~*
