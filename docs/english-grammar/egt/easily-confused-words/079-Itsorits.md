# It’s or its?

*It’s* is the contracted form of *it is* or *it has*:

- *Can you hear that noise? Where do you think **it’s** (it is) coming from?*
- ***It’s*** *(it is) nearly the end of the month. **It’s** (it has) gone really quickly.*

*Its* is a possessive determiner (like *my, your, his*) which we use when referring to things or animals:

- *Every house in the street has got **its** own garage.*
- \[talking about a famous American journalist\]
- *He joined the New York Tribune (1868), becoming **its** editor-in-chief and eventually **its** principal owner (1872–1905).*

We don’t use *its* as a possessive pronoun.
