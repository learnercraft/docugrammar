# Maybe or may be?

We use *maybe* and *may be* to talk about possibility. They are often confused because we use them both when we think that something is possible but we are not certain.

## Maybe as an adverb

*Maybe* /ˈmeɪbi/ is an adverb and it means the same as *perhaps*. It is written as one word:

- ***Maybe*** *no one will come to the party.*
- Not: *~~May be no one will come to the party.~~*

Spoken English:

In speaking, we sometimes use *maybe* at the end of what we say when we are making a suggestion which we are not very certain about:

- A: *There’s something wrong with my PC. I can’t load my photos*.
- B: *It could be a virus*, ***maybe***.

Spoken English:

In speaking, we can use *maybe* as a response when we agree that something is possible:

- A: *Ronnie and Linda are going to leave New Zealand in January*.
- B: *Why? I thought they were very happy there*.
- A: *I’m not sure. Perhaps they feel a bit lonely*.
- B: ***Maybe***.

We can also use *maybe* to express uncertainty in response to a suggestion:

- A: *Would you like to have chicken curry for dinner?*
- B: ***Maybe***.
- A: *You don’t sound very enthusiastic*.
- B: *I just can’t think about dinner right now. I’ve just had breakfast*.

## May be

In the phrase *may be* /meɪ bi:/ *may* is a modal verb and *be* is a main or auxiliary verb. Here *may* and *be* are two separate words, whereas *maybe* is one word:

- *There **may be** a train at 10.00am.*
- Not: *~~There maybe a train at 10.00am.~~*
- *He **may be** waiting for us.*

## Typical error

We use *may* as a modal verb in the phrase *may be*. They are two separate words. We use *maybe* as an adverb:

- *This **may be** the last match that he plays for Barcelona.*
- Not: *~~This maybe the last match that he plays for Barcelona.~~*
