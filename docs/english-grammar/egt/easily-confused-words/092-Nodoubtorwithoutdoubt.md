# No doubt or without doubt?

We can use *no doubt* when we think that what we are saying is likely to happen, or when we think it is true. It is similar to ‘*I suppose*’ or ‘*I imagine*’:

- A: ***No doubt*** *you’ll want breakfast before you leave tomorrow*.
- B: *Yes, if that’s okay*.
- A: *No problem*.

We can use *there is no doubt that …* when we are very certain about our opinion. We use it in formal situations:

- *He’s never won Wimbledon, but **there’s no doubt that** he is a great tennis player.*
- Not: *~~He’s never won a Wimbledon title but no doubt he’s a great tennis player.~~*

*Without doubt* is even more formal. We use it when we are absolutely certain about our opinion:

- *Paul McCartney is **without doubt** one of the greatest composers of popular music of all time.*
- Not: *~~Paul McCartney is no doubt one of the greatest~~* …
