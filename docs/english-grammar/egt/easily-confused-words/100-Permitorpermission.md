# Permit or permission?

The countable noun *permit* (pronounced */ˈpɜ:mɪt/*) refers to an official document that allows you to do something or go somewhere. The uncountable noun *permission* refers to when someone is allowed to do something. It does not refer to a document:

- *You need to have a work **permit** before you can work.*
- Not: *~~You need to have a work permission ...~~*
- *I have a parking **permit** which allows me to park on the street outside my house.*
- Not: *~~I have a parking permission ...~~*

We use the word *permission* with an infinitive with *to*:

- *Could I have your **permission** to leave work early on Friday?*
- *We applied for **permission** to build a house here but our application was refused.*
