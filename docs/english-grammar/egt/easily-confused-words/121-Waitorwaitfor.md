# Wait or wait for?

*Wait* means 'stay in the same place or not do something until something else happens'. We can use it with or without *for*:

- *Put a tea bag into the cup, then add water and **wait** (**for**) a minute or two before taking it out.*
- *I phoned the head office but I had to **wait** (**for**) five minutes before I spoke to anyone.*
- *We **waited** (**for**) hours to get the tickets.*

:::warning

When we use a direct object after *wait*, we have to use *wait for*:

- ***Wait for** us outside the cinema. We'll be there at seven o'clock.*
- Not: *~~Wait us ...~~*
- *I **waited for** the postman every day last week hoping that your present would arrive.*
- Not: *~~I waited the postman ...~~*

:::

### *Wait* with the *to*-infinitive

*Wait* can be followed by the *to*-infinitive:

- *All right, I'll **wait to** hear from you, Adam, then I'll ring Simon.*
- *By 9 pm there were about 20 people still **waiting to** vote.*

### *Can't wait*

When we are very excited about something that is going to happen, we use the phrase *can't wait for +* noun phrase or *can't wait + to*\-infinitive:

- *I **can't wait for** tonight. I'm having a party!* (I'm really looking forward to tonight.)
- *We **can't wait to** go to Barcelona in June.* (We're really looking forward to going.)
