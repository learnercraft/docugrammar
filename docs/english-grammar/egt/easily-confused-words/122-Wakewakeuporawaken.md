# Wake, wake up or awaken?

*Wake* and *wake up* are verbs which mean 'stop sleeping or end someone else's sleep'. They are used in everyday language.

Compare

| Sentence | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- |
| *I **woke** (**up**) suddenly when the alarm clock went off.* | I stopped sleeping. |
| *I **woke** (**up**) the children.* (or *I **woke** the children **up**.*) *They had to be in school early*. | The children were asleep; then I stopped them sleeping. |

*Wake up* has a similar meaning to *wake*. It is sometimes used as a stronger form of *wake*. It can mean 'stop sleeping' and 'make someone feel more awake':

- *The noise of the traffic **wakes** me (**up**) every morning.*
- *She likes to **wake up** with a cup of coffee.* (It makes her feel more awake.)

We use *wake up!* as a command:

- ***Wake up!** It's time to get going.*
- Not: *~~Wake!~~*

The verbs *waken*, *awaken* and *awake* have a similar meaning but are used in more literary contexts, often to refer to emotions or things as well as people:

- *Cautiously, trying not to **waken** him, Caroline stepped quietly out of the room.*
