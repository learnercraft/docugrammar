# Across, over or through?

## Across

We use *across* as a preposition (prep) and an adverb (adv). *Across* means on the other side of something, or from one side to the other of something which has sides or limits such as a city, road or river:

- *We took a boat \[PREP\] **across** the river.*
- *\[PREP\] **Across** the room, she could see some old friends. She got up and went to join them.*
- *My neighbour came \[ADV\] **across** to see me this morning to complain about our cat.*
- *The road was so busy that we found it difficult to get \[ADV\] **across**.*

We also use *across* when something touches or stretches from one side to another:

- *The Ponte Vecchio is a beautiful old bridge **across** the river Arno in Florence.*
- *She divided the page by drawing a red line **across** it. Then she cut it in two.*

Especially in American English, *across from* is used to refer to people or objects being ‘opposite’ or ‘on the other side’:

- *The pharmacy is **across from** the Town Hall.*
- *Helen’s office is just **across from** mine.*

We use *across* to emphasise that something is happening at the same time in many places, e.g. within an organisation, a city or a country:

- *She’s opened coffee shops **across** the city and they’re very successful.*
- ***Across*** *the country, people are coming out to vote for a new president.*

We also use *across* to refer to the width or diagonal measurement of something:

- *The size of a television screen is measured from the higher corner of one side to the lower corner of the other side, that is, from one corner **across** to the opposite corner.*

*Across* comes after measurements when we talk about diameter or width:

- *The building is 157 metres long, 92 metres **across** and the façade is 68 metres wide.*

## Over

We use *over* as a preposition and an adverb to refer to something at a higher position than something else, sometimes involving movement from one side to another:

- *From the castle tower, you can see \[PREP\] **over** the whole city.*
- *We toasted marshmallows \[PREP\] **over** the fire.*
- *We drove high up \[PREP\] **over** the mountains on a narrow dangerous road.*
- *Suddenly a plane flew \[ADV\] **over** and dropped hundreds of leaflets.*

*Come over* often means to come to the speaker’s home:

- *You must **come** \[ADV\] **over** and have dinner with us some time.*

Especially when we use them as adverbs, *over* can mean the same as *across*:

- *We walked **over** to the shop.* (or *We walked **across** to the shop –* the shop is on the other side of the road)
- *I was going **across** to say hello when I realised that I couldn’t remember his name.* (or *I was going **over** to say …* meaning ‘to the other side of the street or room’)

## Across or through?

### Movement

When we talk about movement from one side to another but ‘in something’, such as long grass or a forest, we use *through* instead of *across*:

- *I love walking **through** the forest.* (*through* stresses being in the forest as I walk)
- Not: *~~I love walking across the forest.~~*

- *When my dog runs **through** long grass, it’s difficult to find him.* (*through* stresses that the dog is in the grass)
- Not: *~~When my dog runs across long grass~~* …

### Time

When referring to a period of time from start to finish, American English speakers often use *through* where British English speakers say *from … to/till …*:

- *The office is open Monday **through** Friday, 9 am–5 pm.* (preferred British form: *from Monday to Friday*)

:::warning

We use *over*, not *through*, to refer to periods of time from start to finish when a number is specified (of days, weeks, etc.):

- ***Over*** *the last few days, I have been thinking a lot about quitting my job.*

## Across, over and through: typical errors

When moving from one side to another while surrounded by something, we use *through* not *across*:

- *We cycled **through** a number of small villages.*
- Not: *~~We cycled across a number of small villages.~~*

When we talk about something extending or moving from one side to another, we use *across* not *on*:

- *The papers were spread **across** the table.*
- Not: *~~The papers were spread on the table.~~*

We don’t use *through* when we’re talking about periods of time from start to finish and we mention a specific number of days, weeks, etc:

- *We haven’t seen each other much **over** the last four years.*
- Not: *~~We haven’t seen each other much through the last four years.~~*
