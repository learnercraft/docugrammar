# All or whole?

*All* and *whole* are determiners.

We use them before nouns and with other determiners to refer to a total number or complete set of things in a group.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>All the cast</i></b><i> had food poisoning. They were forced to cancel the show.</i></td><td><i>all</i> + determiner + noun</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>The whole cast</i></b><i> had food poisoning. They were forced to cancel the show.</i></td><td>determiner + <i>whole</i> + noun</td></tr></tbody></table>

- ***All my*** *family lives abroad. or **My whole** family lives abroad.*

We often use *all* and *the whole* with *of the*:

- *She complains **all of the** time. or She complains **the whole of the** time.*

We use *a/an* with *whole* but not with *all*:

- *I spent **a whole** day looking for that book and eventually found it in a little old bookshop on the edge of town.*
- Not: … ~~all a day~~ …

## All or whole for single entities

We use *the whole* or *the whole of* to refer to complete single things and events that are countable and defined:

- ***The whole performance*** *was disappointing from start to finish.* (or ***The whole of the performance*** *was disappointing …*)

When we can split up a thing into parts, we can use either *whole* or *all* with the same meaning:

- *You don’t have to pay **the whole (of the) bill** at once.*
- *You don’t have to pay **all (of) the bill** at once.*
- *She ate **the whole orange**.*
- *She ate **all of the orange**.*

We often use *the whole of* with periods of time to emphasise duration:

- *We spent **the whole (of the) summer** at the beach.*

## All the with uncountable nouns

We use *all the* and not *the whole* with uncountable nouns:

- *She was given **all the advice** she needed.*
- Not: *~~She was given the whole advice~~* …
- ***All the equipment*** *is supplied.*

## All and whole with plural nouns

We usually use *all the* and *all of the* with plural nouns:

- *It’s funny when **all the actors** come in dressed up in their costumes.*
- *She opens **all the cupboard doors** and doesn’t close them after her.*
- *You have to try **all of the activities**.*

When we use *whole* with plural nouns, it means ‘complete’ or ‘entire’.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>Whole families</i></b><i> normally shared one room in the nineteenth century.</i></td><td>entire families</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>All families</i></b><i> normally shared one bedroom in the nineteenth century.</i></td><td>each and every family</td></tr></tbody></table>

## All and whole: typical errors

We don’t use *all* before *a* and *an*:

- *She ate **a whole** bar of chocolate in one go.*
- Not: *~~She ate all a bar~~* …

We can’t omit *the* before *whole* with a singular noun:

- *We travelled throughout **the whole country**.*
- Not: … ~~throughout whole country~~.
