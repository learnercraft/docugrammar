# Also, as well or too?

*Also, as well* and *too* are adverbs and mean *‘*in addition*’*.

## Also

*Also* is commonly used in writing, but is less common in speaking. *Also* occupies different positions in a sentence.

We use *also* in front position to emphasise what follows or to add a new point or topic:

- *It’s very humid. **Also**, you can easily get sunburnt.*
- \[on the telephone\] *OK, I’ll phone you next week and we can discuss it then. **Also**, we need to decide who will be going to Singapore.*

We use *also* in the normal mid position for adverbs, between the subject and main verb, or after the modal verb or first auxiliary verb, or after *be* as a main verb. In this position, the meaning of *also* usually connects back to the whole clause that comes before:

- *She works very hard but she **also goes** to the gym every week.*
- *I’ve been working in the garden this week, and I**’ve also been** reading a lot.*

In end position, *also* normally connects two phrases. We use *as well* and *too* instead of *also*, in end position, especially in speech:

- *She contacted him in the office but he didn’t answer the phone. His mobile phone was silent **also**.* (or *His mobile phone was silent* ***too***. or … *was silent* ***as well***.)

## As well

Spoken English:

*As well* is much more common in speaking than in writing, and is more common in speaking than *also*.

*As well* almost always comes in end position:

- \[In a restaurant. Customer (A) is ordering from a waiter (B)\]  
  A: *I’ll have steak please*.  
  B: *Yes*.  
  A: *And I’ll have the mixed vegetables* ***as well***.

## Too

We usually put *too* in end position:

- *Gill’s having chicken. I’ll probably have chicken **too**.*
- *She looks really tired and she must be really hungry **too**.*

*Too* can occur immediately after the subject, if it refers directly to the subject. It does not normally occur after a modal or auxiliary verb. We sometimes write commas before and after *too*:

- *I **too** thought she looked unwell.*
- *We, **too**, have been very pleased to receive the prize on her behalf.*
- Not: *~~We have too been very pleased~~* …

*Too* is especially common in responses to fixed expressions such as giving good wishes, and in responses consisting of a single object pronoun:

- A: *Enjoy the play*.  
  B: *Thanks. You enjoy your evening **too***. (preferred to *You enjoy your evening* ***as well***. or *You* ***also** enjoy your evening*.)

- A: *I need to go to the gym*.  
  B: *Yeah, me* ***too***. (preferred to *Yeah, me* ***also***. or *Yeah, me* ***as well***.)

In imperative clauses, *as well* and *too* are normally preferred to *also*:

- \[customer in a post office, buying books of first and second class stamps\]
- *Give me a book of ten first and a book of ten second **as well** then please.* (preferred to … *and a book of ten second **also** then please*.)

## Linking negatives

We use *either* not *also*, *as well* or *too* to connect two negative ideas:

- *Bill’s **not** here. I do**n’t** think Dave is **either**, is he?*
- Not: *~~I don’t think Dave is also/as well/too.~~*
- A: *That’s **not** in paperback yet. It’s **not** been in any book clubs* ***either***, *has it?*  
  B: *No*.
- Not: *~~It’s not been in any book clubs also/as well/too, has it?~~*

## Also, as well and too: typical error

We don’t use *as well* at the beginning of a clause. *As well* usually comes at the end of a clause:

- *I just ignored it. I think everybody else did **as well**.*
- Not: *~~As well I think everybody else did.~~*
