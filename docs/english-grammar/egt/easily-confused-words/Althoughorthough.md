# Although or though?

## Although and though meaning ‘in spite of’

*Although* and *though* both mean ‘in spite of something’. They are subordinating conjunctions. This means that the clause which they introduce is a subordinate clause, which needs a main clause to make it complete:

- *\[main clause\] Everyone enjoyed the trip to the final **although** \[subordinate clause\] we lost the match!*
- *\[subordinate clause\] **Though** it was rainy, \[main clause\] we put on our jackets and went for a walk.*

Spoken English:

*Though* is more common than *although* in general and it is much more common than *although* in speaking. For emphasis, we often use *even* with *though* (but not with *although*).

:::warning

When the *though/although* clause comes before the main clause, we usually put a comma at the end of the clause. When the main clause comes first, we don’t need to use a comma:

- ***Even though*** *I earn a lot of money every month, I never seem to have any to spare!*
- *I still feel hungry **even though** I had a big lunch.*

- *Even if*

### Although and though with \-ing clauses

In formal situations, we can use *although* and *though* to introduce an *\-ing* clause:

- \[a teacher talking about a student\]
- *Peter, **although working** harder this term, still needs to put more work into mathematics.*
- \[a doctor talking about a patient\]
- *The patient, **though getting** stronger, is still not well enough to come off his medication.*

### Although and though with reduced clauses

In formal speaking or writing, we can use *although, though* and *even though* to introduce a clause without a verb (a reduced clause):

- *Raymond, **although very interested**, didn’t show any emotion when she invited him to go for a walk.*
- \[referring to a car\]
- ***Though more expensive****, the new model is safer and more efficient.*

## Although and though meaning ‘but’

When the *although/though* clause comes after a main clause, it can also mean ‘but it is also true that …’:

- *Karen is coming to stay next week **although** I’m not sure what day she is coming.*
- *We didn’t make any profit **though** nobody knows why.*

## Though meaning ‘however’

Spoken English:

Especially in speaking, we can use *though* (but not *although* or *even though*) with a meaning similar to *however* or *nevertheless*. In these cases, we usually put it at the end of a clause:

- A: *You have six hours in the airport between flights!*
- B: *I don’t mind*, ***though***. *I have lots of work to do. I’ll just bring my laptop with me*.
- A: *It’s expensive*.
- B: *It’s nice*, ***though***.
- A: *Yeah, I think I’ll buy it*.

## As though

*As though* has a meaning very similar to *as if. As if* is much more common than *as though*:

- *You look **as though/as if** you have seen a ghost!*
- *He looks **as though/as if** he hasn’t slept.*
