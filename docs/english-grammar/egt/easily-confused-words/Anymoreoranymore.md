# Any more or anymore?

## Any more as a determiner

We use *any more* as a determiner to describe ‘an indefinite quantity of something’. *Any more* is similar to *some more*. *Some more* is more common in affirmative statements; *any more* is more common in questions, in clauses with *if* and in sentences with negative words such as *hardly, never, scarcely*:

- *Would you like **any more** tea?*
- *If you find **any more** books, please let us know.*
- *She doesn’t want* ***any more contact with him.***
- *There are hardly **any more** people here than last month.*
- *Yes, I’d like **some more** information about trains to Berlin, please.*
- Not: *~~Yes, I’d like any more information about~~* …

## Any more as an adverb

*Any more* is also an adverb and has the meaning of ‘no longer’ or ‘in the past but not now.’ In this meaning, we use it in end position:

- *We don’t go to Cornwall on holiday **any more**.* (We used to go in the past but not now.)
- *The cost of electricity is not cheap **any more**.*

Especially in American English, *any more*, as an adverb, can be written as one word, *anymore*:

- *He doesn’t cycle **anymore**.*
