# As, when or while?

*As*, *when* and *while* are conjunctions. In some uses *as, when* and *while* can mean the same, but they can also have slightly different meanings. We use them to introduce subordinate clauses.

We can use *as, when* and *while* to mean ‘during the time that’, to connect two events happening at the same time:

- *Another coach-load of people arrived **as** we were leaving.*

We often use them with the past continuous to refer to background events:

- ***When*** *the men were out working in the field, I helped with milking the cows, feeding the calves and the pigs.*
- ***While*** *he was working, he often listened to music.*

We can put clauses with *as, when* and *while* before or after the main clause. When they come before the main clause, we use a comma:

- ***As*** *she was leaving the court, a crowd of photographers gathered around her.* (before the main clause, followed by a comma)
- *Steven was very unhappy **when** things weren’t going well for him.*
- *Lucy came into the room **while** he was waiting.*

## As

We can use *as* to introduce two events happening at the same time. After *as*, we can use a simple or continuous form of the verb. The continuous form emphasises an action that interrupts or occurs during the progress of another action:

- ***As*** *she walked to the door, she thanked them for a lovely dinner.*
- ***As*** *they were signing the contract, they noticed that a page was missing.*

## When

We can use *when* to introduce a single completed event that takes place in the middle of a longer activity or event. In these cases, we usually use a continuous verb in the main clause to describe the background event:

- *He was walking back to his flat **when** he heard an explosion.*

Depending on the context, *when* can mean ‘after’ or ‘at the same time’.

Compare:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>When</i></b><i> you open the file, check the second page.</i></td><td><i>when</i> meaning ‘after’</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I eat ice cream </i><b><i>when</i></b><i> I am on holiday.</i></td><td><i>when</i> meaning ‘at the same time’</td></tr></tbody></table>

We often use *just* with *when* or *as* to express things happening at exactly the same time:

- *The phone always rings **just when** I’m closing the front door.*
- *She was a brilliant gymnast, but she had a terrible accident in 1999, **just as** her career was taking off.*

## While and as

We can use *while* or *as* to talk about two longer events or activities happening at the same time. We can use either simple or continuous verb forms:

- *We spent long evenings talking in my sitting-room **while** he played the music he had chosen and explained his ideas.*
- *We were lying on the beach sunbathing **as** they were playing volleyball.*

## When and while without a subject

We can use *when* and *while* without a verb, or without a subject + auxiliary verb *be*:

- *Go past the village signpost and you get to a church. **When** there, take the next turning right.* (formal)
- *He read his book **while** waiting for the bus.* (while he was waiting)

We can’t use *as* in this way:

- *We ate our sandwiches **as** we walked around the park.*
- Not: … ~~as walking around the park.~~
