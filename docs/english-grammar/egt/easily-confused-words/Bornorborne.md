# Born or borne?

## Born

We use *born* in the phrase *be born* to indicate that a child has entered the world:

- *They say that in China a new baby **is born** every five minutes.*

:::warning

We use *was*/*were born* when we talk about when or where someone started their life:

- *I **was born** in 1988.*
- Not: *~~I am born in 1988~~. Or ~~I born in 1988.~~*

:::

## Bear, bore, borne

*Bear* means to tolerate something, usually something that you dislike. It is most commonly used in the expression *can’t bear*. The past form is *bore* and the -*ed* form is *borne*:

- *I can’t **bear** so much football on television.*
- *She has **borne** all her problems with great courage.*

The verb *bear* is sometimes used to describe the act of giving birth. It is most commonly used in the past tense and in rather formal situations. *Have* is more common when talking about giving birth:

- *She **bore** twelve children in twenty-two years.* (or, more commonly, *She **had** twelve children …*)
