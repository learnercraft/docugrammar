# Each or every?

We use *each* to refer to individual things in a group or a list of two or more things. It is often similar in meaning to *every*, but we use *every* to refer to a group or list of three or more things.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>Each one</i></b><i> takes turns cooking dinner in the evenings.</i></td><td><i>Each</i> stresses individual members of a group.<i>Each</i> refers to two or more people who share the work.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>Everyone</i></b><i> takes turns cooking dinner in the evenings.</i></td><td><i>Every</i> stresses all the members of the complete group.<i>Every</i> refers to three or more people.</td></tr></tbody></table>

We use adverbs such as *almost, practically* and *nearly* with *every*, but not with *each*:

- ***Almost every*** *car in the car park was new.*
- Not: *~~Almost each car~~* …
- ***Practically every*** *house now has at least two televisions.*
- Not: *~~Practically each house~~* …

We can use *each of* + pronoun or *each of* + determiner + noun, but with *every* we must use *every one* + pronoun or *every one* + determiner + noun:

- ***Each of us*** *has a bicycle.*
- ***Every one of us*** *has a bicycle.* Not: *~~Every of us~~* …
- ***Each of the children*** *received a special gift.*
- ***Every one of the children*** *received a special gift.* Not: *~~Every of the children~~* …
