# Forget or leave?

We sometimes use *forget* when we don’t remember to bring something with us:

- *I’ll have to go back; I’ve **forgotten** my car keys.*

We use *leave* with this same meaning, but only if we mention the place where we left something:

- *Mia, you’re always **leaving** your car keys on your desk.*
- Not: … ~~forgetting your car keys on your desk~~. or … ~~you’re always leaving your car keys.~~

- *I **left** my homework at home.*
- Not: *~~I forgot my homework at home.~~*

We use *leave* when the action is deliberate:

- *We decided to **leave** the dog at home.*
