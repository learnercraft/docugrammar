# Get or go?

*Get* and *go* have similar meanings, when talking about travel or motion. When we use *get*, we emphasise arrival:

- *We’ll phone you as soon as we **get** to Rome.*
- Not: *~~We’ll phone you as soon as we go to Rome.~~*

- *The thing is, he missed the bus and **got** to school late and missed part of the match.*
- Not: … ~~and went to school late and~~ …

We use *get on* and *get off* not *go on* and *go off* for buses, trains, planes:

- *When I **got on** the plane, there was someone sitting in my seat.*
- Not: *~~When I went on the plane~~* …

- *Liam will be waiting for me when I **get off** the train.*
- Not: … ~~when I go off the train.~~

:::warning

*Get up* means ‘leave your bed in the morning’; *go up* means ‘go to a higher place or position’:

- *What time do we have to **get up** tomorrow?*
- Not: *~~What time do we have to go up tomorrow?~~*

*Get* and *go* are both used to mean ‘become’, but they combine with different adjectives. We often use *get* with words like *dark, light* and *late*; we use *go* with colours and words with negative associations such as *mad, bald, bad*:

- *It’s **getting** dark now so be careful.*
- Not: … ~~going dark~~ …

- *He’s only 30 and he’s **going** bald.*
- Not: … ~~and he’s getting bald~~.
- *We left the milk in the sun too long and it’s **gone** bad.*
- Not: … ~~and it’s got bad~~.

:::

However, with some adjectives such as *old, sick, tired* and *ill*, we use *get*:

- *He **got** very tired walking to the match in such a large crowd.*
- Not: *~~He went very tired walking~~* …
