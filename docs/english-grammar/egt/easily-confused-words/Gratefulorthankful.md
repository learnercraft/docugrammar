# Grateful or thankful?

We use *grateful* to talk about how we feel when someone is kind to us or does us a favour:

- \[a message on a thank-you card\]
- *Thank you so much for helping us move house. We are so **grateful**.*
- *Love*
- *Mark and Rose*
- \[at the end of a formal letter\]
- *I would be very **grateful** if you could send me more information about your company for my school project.*
- Not: *~~I would be thankful~~* …

We usually use *thankful* when we are relieved that something unpleasant or dangerous didn’t happen:

- A: *I heard you were in an accident. Are you okay?*
- B: *I’m fine. There was some damage to the car. I’m just **thankful** that no one was injured*.
