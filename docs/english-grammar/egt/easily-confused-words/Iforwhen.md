# If or when?

We use *if* to introduce a possible or unreal situation or condition. We use *when* to refer to the time of a future situation or condition that we are certain of:

- *You can only go in **if** you’ve got your ticket.*
- ***When*** *I’m older, I’d love to be a dancer.*

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>If</i></b><i> Giles comes back to the office, can you tell him I’ve gone home.</i></td><td>The speaker does not know whether Giles is coming back to the office. It is possible, but not definite.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>When</i></b><i> Giles comes back to the office, can you tell him I’ve gone home.</i></td><td>The speaker is certain that Giles is coming back to the office.</td></tr></tbody></table>

To talk about situations and conditions that are repeated or predictable, we can use either *if* or *when* + present verb form:

- *You can drive **if** you’re 17.*
- ***If*** *you don’t add enough wood, the fire goes out.*
- ***When*** *we go camping, we usually take two tents.*
- *She gets out of breath easily **when** she’s jogging.*

## Typical error

We don’t use *when* to introduce possible or unreal situations:

- *Unfortunately, **if** you arrive too late, you are not allowed to take the exam because they don’t accept late enrolment.*
- Not: … ~~when you arrive too late~~ …
