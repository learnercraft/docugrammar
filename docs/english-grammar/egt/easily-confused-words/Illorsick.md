# Ill or sick?

*Ill* and *sick* are both adjectives that mean ‘not in good health’. We use both *ill* and *sick* after a verb such as *be, become, feel, look* or *seem*:

- *I was **ill** for a time last year, but I’m fine now.*
- *Nancy looks **ill**. I wonder what’s wrong with her.*
- *I felt **sick** and had to go home at lunchtime.*

We can use *sick* before a noun but we don’t normally use *ill* before a noun:

- *She’s been looking after a **sick** child this week, so she’s not at work.*
- Not: … ~~an ill child~~ …

Note that *to be sick* means ‘to vomit’ in British English. In American English it means more generally ‘to be unwell’.
