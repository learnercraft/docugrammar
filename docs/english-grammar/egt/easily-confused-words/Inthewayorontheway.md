# In the way or on the way?

## In the way

If something or someone is *in the way* or *in my/his/our way*, it is in the space which someone needs for a particular movement or action:

- *She can’t do her dance because the table is **in the way**. Can you help me move it?*

## On the way

We use *on the way* or *on my/his/our way (to*) when we talk about the route, direction or path to somewhere:

- *We could leave early and have breakfast **on the way**.* (during our journey to somewhere)
- *I was **on my way to** Peter’s house when I met him in the street.* (I was going to Peter’s house when I met him)

We can use *on the way to* (plus a noun or an -*ing* form of a verb) to mean ‘close to’ doing or completing something:

- *Brazil is **on the way to** becom**ing** one of the world’s strongest economies.*
