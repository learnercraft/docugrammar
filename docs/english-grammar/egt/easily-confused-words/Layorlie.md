# Lay or lie?

The verb *lay* means ‘to put something down carefully in a flat position’. It must have an object. It is a regular verb, but note the spelling of the past simple and *\-ed* form: *laid* not *layed*:

- *Shall I **lay** the tray on the bed?*
- *A wonderful wooden floor has been **laid** in the dining room.*
- Not: … ~~floor has been layed~~ …

*Lie* is a verb which means ‘to be in or put yourself into a flat position’. It is an irregular verb and it doesn’t take an object. The *\-ing* form is *lying* and the past simple is *lay*. The *\-ed* form, *lain*, is very formal and is rarely used:

- *I love to **lie** on a beach and read.*
- *She **lay** on the bed and gazed at the ceiling, daydreaming.*
- *The dog was **lying** by the gate waiting for me to come home.*

*Lie* can also mean ‘say something which is not true’. In this case, it is a regular verb:

- *I **lied** to my teacher about my homework.*

## Typical errors

We don’t use *lay* to talk about being in a flat position. *Lay* must have an object:

- *My mother hates when the cat **lies** on our beds.*
- Not: … ~~when the cat lays on our beds~~ …

The past form of *lie* is *lay*:

- *I **lay** on the grass and watched a plane fly overhead.*
- Not: *~~I lied on the grass~~* …
