# Low or short?

We use *low* for things which are not high, or which are close to the ground or to the bottom of something:

- *We have a sofa, two armchairs and a **low** table.*
- *The wall is too **low**; we need to make it higher so the dog can’t get out.*

:::warning

We use *short*, not *low*, to describe people’s height:

- *Joseph is quite **short** but his brothers are both really tall.*
- Not: *~~Joseph is quite low~~* …
