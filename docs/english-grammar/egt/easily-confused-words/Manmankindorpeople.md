# Man, mankind or people?

## Man and mankind

Traditionally, we use *man* to refer to all human beings, male and female, usually in contrast with other animals. However, many people consider this to be sexist, so it is better to use a different expression, such as *human beings*:

- ***Human beings*** *first emerged in Africa, some two million years ago.* (preferred to *Man first emerged* …)

*Mankind* can also refer to all human beings, male and female, usually in the sense of social or conscious beings. Although people generally consider it less sexist than *man*, it is usually better to use a different expression, such as *human beings* (with a plural verb) or *humankind* (with a singular verb):

- ***Human beings*** *have always dreamt of happiness and of a perfect world.* or ***Humankind*** *has always dreamt of happiness* … (preferred to *Mankind has always dreamt* …)

## People

*People* can refer to all human beings, or to a group of persons in a particular situation. It is a plural noun and it takes a plural verb:

- ***People*** *will always need food, so the food industry will never disappear.* (all human beings)
- *It’s difficult to sell an old computer. **People** don’t want second-hand ones.* (those typical persons interested in buying computers)
- ***People*** *started coming into the hall at five-thirty, almost an hour before the start of the meeting.* (those persons who were attending the meeting)

:::warning

We don’t use *the* with *man, mankind, humankind* or *people* when they are used with a general meaning to refer to all human beings:

- ***People*** */ **Human beings** will always defend their territory against an attack from outside.*
- Not: *~~The people/The human beings~~* …
