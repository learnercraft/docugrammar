# Nearest or next?

*Nearest* is the superlative form of *near*. It means ‘the closest in distance or time’:

- *We need to buy some food. Where’s the **nearest** supermarket?* (There may be several supermarkets: which one is the shortest distance from here?)
- Not: *~~Where’s the next supermarket?~~*
- *Feeling very sick, she took a taxi to the **nearest** hospital.*

*Next* means ‘the first person or thing after the present one or after the one just mentioned’:

- *We had the addresses of three restaurants. The first one we went to was closed. The **next** one was open but full. Luckily, the last one had a table free.*
- A: *When is your yoga lesson?*
- B: ***Next*** *Wednesday at five*.
