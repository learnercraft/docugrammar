# Nice or sympathetic?

*Nice* is an adjective meaning ‘pleasant’, ‘enjoyable’ or ‘satisfactory’:

- *Have a **nice** trip!*
- *We had a really **nice** meal. Thank you.*

When we use it to talk about someone, it means ‘kind’, ‘friendly’ or ‘polite’:

- *It was really **nice** of you to call me.*
- *Tanya’s new boyfriend is so **nice**.*

*Sympathetic* is an adjective used to describe a person who shows that they understand and care about someone’s suffering or problems, especially by what they say:

- *My colleagues were so **sympathetic** when I was ill.*
- *As a teacher, you have to be **sympathetic** to the problems of your students.*

:::warning

We don’t use *sympathetic* to mean ‘nice’:

- *Our new teacher is really **nice**.*
- Not: *~~Our new teacher is really sympathetic.~~*
- *His small house was **nice** and warm.*
- Not: *~~His small house was sympathetic and warm.~~*
