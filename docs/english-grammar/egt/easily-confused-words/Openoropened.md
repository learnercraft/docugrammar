# Open or opened?

We use *open* as an adjective to mean ‘not closed’:

- *I stopped the car when I realised that the door was **open**.*
- Not: … ~~that the door was opened~~.

*Opened* is the past form of the verb *open*:

- *Can you **open** the window, please?* (present)
- *She **opened** her eyes and immediately looked at the clock.* (past)

:::warning

We don’t use *open* to refer to turning on taps and switches:

- *Please **turn on** the taps separately.*
- Not: *~~Please open the taps~~* …
- *Can you **switch on** the lights, please?*
- Not: *~~Can you open the lights~~* …
