# Remember or remind?

### *Remember*

If we *remember* someone or something, we keep that person or thing in our mind or we bring that person or thing back to our mind:

- *I will always **remember** you. You have helped me so much.*
- Not: *~~I will always remind you.~~*
- *Suddenly I **remembered** that I had promised to ring my mother.*

*Remember + to*-infinitive means that we don't forget to do something:

- ***Remember** to save your work often, just in case your computer crashes.*

*Remember* \+ the *\-ing* form of a verb means 'have a memory of something we did or of something that happened in the past':

- *I **remember** meeting her once. It must have been about five years ago.*
- Not: *~~I remember to meet her once ...~~*
- *She said she didn't **remember** getting an email from him.*

We can also use *remember* + object + *to* when we ask someone to 'give regards to' or 'say hello to' someone:

- A: ***Remember** me to* *your parents when you see them*.  
  B: *I will. They always ask about you*.

### *Remind*

If a person or thing *reminds* you *of* someone or something, they make you think of that person or thing, or they resemble that person or thing:

- *That song always **reminds** me of the time I fell in love with an Italian girl.*
- Not: *~~... always remembers me of the time ...~~*
- *Jason **reminded** me of my father. They had the same eyes and the same way of talking.*
- Not: *~~Jason reminded me my father.~~*

If we *remind* someone *to do* something or about something, we make them remember it or help them not to forget it:

- *He's probably forgotten he was supposed to be here at 6. Shall I ring him and **remind** him?*
- ***Remind** me to email Tony today; otherwise I'll probably forget.*
- Not: *~~Remember me to email Tony today;~~*
