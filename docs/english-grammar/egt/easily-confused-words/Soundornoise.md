# Sound or noise?

*Sound* and *noise* are nouns. We can use them both as countable or uncountable nouns. Both refer to something which you can hear, but when a *sound* is unwanted or unpleasant, we call it a *noise*:

- *There were lots of **sounds** in the forest.* (countable)
- *It travels faster than the speed of **sound**.* (uncountable)
- *She made a lot of **noise**.* (uncountable)
- *There were some funny **noises** coming from the engine.* (countable)
