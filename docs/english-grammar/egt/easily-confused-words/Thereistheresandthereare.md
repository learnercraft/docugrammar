# There is, thereâ€™s and there are

We use *there is* and *there are* when we first refer to the existence or presence of someone or something:

- ***There's** a letter on your desk. Julia brought it from the mail room.*
- Not: *~~It's a letter on your desk.~~*
- ***There are** three Japanese students in my class.*

*There is* and *there's* are both singular forms. We use *there's* more commonly in informal speaking:

- ***There is** a new cafe in the centre of town which sells Indonesian food.*
- *She's very determined and **there's** no chance she will change her mind.*

*There are* is the plural form of *there is* and *there's*:

- ***There are** two new buildings next to the school. They are both science buildings.*

In speaking and in some informal writing, we use *there's* even when it refers to more than one. This use could be considered incorrect in formal writing or in an examination:

- ***There's** three other people who are still to come.*
- ***There's** lots of cars in the car park.*
