# Worth or worthwhile?

*Worth* and *worthwhile* are adjectives.

*Worth* is only used after verbs such as *be*, *seem*, *look* (as a predicative adjective). It means 'having a particular value', especially in money:

- A: *I wonder how much the house is **worth**?*  
  B: *About half a million, probably*.

*To be worth* doing something is a common expression. It means that something is useful or important enough to do:

- A: *I haven't had a reply to my email to Jane. **Is it worth** phoning her, do you think?* (Would it be useful to phone her?)  
  B: *You could try, I suppose*.
- *We decided **it wasn't worth** going all the way to London to buy books we could get on the Internet.*

*To be worth it* means 'to be of reasonable or good value for the price':

- *A business class ticket cost Â£2,000, but **it was worth it** for such a long flight. It was very comfortable.*

We use *worthwhile* before a noun (as an attributive adjective) or after verbs such as *be, seem, look* (as a predicative adjective). It means 'useful', 'important' or 'good enough to be a suitable reward for the money or time spent or the effort made':

- *Do you think working in a supermarket is a **worthwhile** career for a highly intelligent person?*
- *We had thought of buying a bigger car, but we didn't think it was **worthwhile**, since there's just the two of us.*
