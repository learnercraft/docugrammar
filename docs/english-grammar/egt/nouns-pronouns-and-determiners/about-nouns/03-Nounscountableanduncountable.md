# Nouns: countable and uncountable

## Countable nouns

Some nouns refer to things which, in English, are treated as separate items which can be counted. These are called countable nouns. Here are some examples:

- *a **car**, three* ***cars***
- *my **cousin**, my two* ***cousins***
- *a **book**, a box full of* ***books***
- *a **city**, several big* ***cities***

### Singular and plural

Countable nouns can be singular or plural. They can be used with *a/an* and with numbers and many other determiners (e.g. *these, a few*):

- *She’s got **two*** ***sisters** and **a** younger **brother**.*
- *Most people buy **things** like **cameras** and **MP3-players** online **these*** ***days**.*
- ***These*** ***shoes*** *look old now.*
- *I’ll take **a few magazines** with me for **the flight**.*

## Uncountable nouns

In English grammar, some things are seen as a whole or mass. These are called uncountable nouns, because they cannot be separated or counted.

Some examples of uncountable nouns are:

- Ideas and experiences: *advice, information, progress, news, luck, fun, work*
- Materials and substances: *water, rice, cement, gold, milk*
- Weather words: *weather, thunder, lightning, rain, snow*
- Names for groups or collections of things: *furniture, equipment, rubbish, luggage*
- Other common uncountable nouns include: *accommodation, baggage, homework, knowledge, money, permission, research, traffic, travel*.

These nouns are not used with *a/an* or numbers and are not used in the plural.

- *We’re going to get new **furniture** for the living room.*
- Not: *~~We’re going to get a new furniture for the living room~~. or ~~We’re going to get new furnitures for the living room~~*.
- *We had terrible **weather** last week.*
- Not: *~~We had a terrible weather last week.~~*
- *We need **rice** next time we go shopping.*

Some nouns always have plural form but they are uncountable because we cannot use numbers with them.

- *I bought **two pairs of trousers**.*
- Not: *~~I bought two trousers.~~*

Other nouns of this type are: *shorts, pants, pyjamas, glasses* (for the eyes), *binoculars, scissors*.

:::warning

Some nouns which are uncountable in English are countable in other languages (e.g. *accommodation, advice, furniture, information*):

- *They can give you some **information** about **accommodation** at the tourist office.*
- Not: *~~They can give you some informations about accommodations at the tourist office.~~*
- *Can you give me some **advice** about buying a second-hand car?*
- Not: *~~Can you give me some advices about buying a second-hand car?~~*

:::

A good learner’s dictionary will tell you whether a noun is countable or uncountable.

### Quantity expressions (a bit/piece)

To refer to one or more quantities of an uncountable noun, expressions such as *a bit of, a piece of*, *an item of* or words for containers and measures must be used:

- *He bought **a** very expensive **piece of furniture** for his new apartment.*
- *Maggie always has some exciting **bits of news** when she comes to see us.*
- *I think we’ll need **five bags of cement** for the patio.*
- *There’s **a litre of milk** in the fridge for you. And I bought you **a bar of chocolate**.*

### Determiners (my, some, the)

Uncountable nouns can be used with certain determiners (e.g. *my, her*, *some, any*, *no*, *the, this, that*) and expressions of quantity (e.g. *a lot of, (a) little*):

- *They gave me **some information** about courses and scholarships and things.*
- *Have you heard **the news**? Fran’s getting engaged.*
- *She’s been studying hard and has made **a lot of progress**.*
- *There’s **no work** to do here, so you can go home if you like.*
- ***This milk****’s a bit old, I’m afraid.*

### Countable phrases for uncountable nouns

We can sometimes use countable noun phrases to talk about an individual example of the thing an uncountable noun refers to.

## Uncountable nouns used countably

### Measures and examples

Sometimes uncountable nouns are used countably, to mean ‘a measure of something’ or ‘a type or example of something’:

- *Can I have **two teas** and **one coffee**, please?* (two cups of tea and one cup of coffee …?)
- A: *How many **sugars** do you want in your tea?* (How many spoonfuls/lumps of sugar?)
- B: *Just one, please*.
- *To some degree we tend to eat the **foods** that we ate as children.* (i.e. types of food)

### Abstract nouns

Some abstract nouns can be used uncountably or countably. The uncountable use has a more general meaning. The countable use has a more particular meaning.

Nouns of this type include: *education, experience, hatred, help, knowledge, life, love, sleep, time, understanding*.
