# Nouns: forming nouns from other words

We often form nouns from other parts of speech, most commonly from a verb or an adjective. We can then use the noun phrase instead of the verb or adjective to create a more formal style. We call this nominalisation:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>excite → excitement</i></td><td><i>grow → growth</i></td><td><i>invade → invasion</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>fly → flight</i></td><td><i>industrial → industrialisation</i></td><td><i>wide → width</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

*After 1900 there was a **growth** in trade with Europe.* (less formal: *After 1900 trade with Europe grew*.)

*The **closure** of the Meteorcorp factory caused 200 workers to lose their jobs.* (less formal: *Meteorcorp closed the factory and 200 workers lost their jobs*.)

Nominalisation is common in writing, especially formal writing.
