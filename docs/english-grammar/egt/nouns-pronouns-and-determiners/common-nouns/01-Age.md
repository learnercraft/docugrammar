# Age

We use *age* as a noun to refer to how many years someone has lived:

- *She looks a lot younger but she is actually the same **age** as me.*

*At the age of …* is a common expression:

- *He started to play golf **at the age of** three.*
- *The two sisters started their careers as teachers **at the ages of** thirty and thirty-three.*

:::warning

We don’t say *in the age of* when we refer to people’s age:

- *Children normally start school **at the age of** five.*
- Not: *~~Children normally start school in the age of five.~~*

:::

When we talk about someone’s age, we use *of age* or *old*. *Of age* sounds more formal than *old*:

- *He is a fully qualified pilot and is only twenty-five years **of age**.* (more formal)
- *He is a fully qualified pilot and is only twenty-five years **old**.* (less formal)

When asking direct questions about someone’s age or the age of a thing, we don’t normally use *age*. We say *How old …?*

- ***How old*** *are you?*
- Not: *~~What is your age?~~*
- ***How old*** *is your car?*
- Not: *~~What age is your car?~~*

We only use *What age …?* in more formal situations:

- ***What age*** *was the child when she first showed signs of the illness?*

*Age* or *ages* can also be used to mean ‘a long time’, or a specific long period in history:

- *It seems an **age** since we last saw them.*
- *During the Ice **Age**, the whole of Britain was covered in a sheet of ice.*
- *I waited for them for **ages** but they must have forgotten about the meeting.*

We say *the Middle Ages* to refer to the period of European history from about the sixth to the sixteenth century AD:

- *Life in **the Middle Ages** was very hard for most people.*
- Not: *~~Life in the middle age~~* …

*Middle age and middle-aged* refer to a person’s life from the ages of about 40 to 65:

- ***Middle age*** *is the most prosperous time of life for many people.*
- *Many **middle-aged** people go to keep-fit classes.*
