# Sort, type and kind

*Sort, type* and *kind* all generally mean the same thing. They are words we use to refer to a group of people or things which share the same characteristics. We use these words very often when we describe things and we often find them in dictionary definitions:

- *Jazz isn’t the **sort** of music I can listen to for very long.*
- *A fastener is a **type** of metal button which fits together to join clothes, for example a coat might have fasteners.*
- *There are many **kinds** of birds coming to feed in my garden at the moment.*

We often use *sort, type* and *kind* as vague expressions to suggest that we think something is like something else. We do this either because we are not sure, or because we do not want to be too specific and too direct:

- \[joking about a cheap perfume that someone got as a present\]
- *And it was, it was really cheap, I mean, it was a **sort** of a rose perfume and I think the whole box only cost him one pound fifty, or something. You could probably run your car off it.*

We sometimes use *some* before *sort, type* and *kind* as vague expressions:

- *Karen has made **some sort** of cake for the party.*
- *There was **some type** of hole in the road and we didn’t see it.*
- *There’s **some kind** of strange smell in here.*

We often use *and that kind of thing* or *and that sort of thing* to refer to categories. We usually give an example or two from the category we are referring to first, e.g. *apples and that kind of thing, bookshops and libraries and that sort of thing*:

- A: *What are you doing tonight?*
- B: *Well, first, I’ve got lots of marking **and that sort of thing** to do*.
- A: *Are you taking anything to eat?*
- B: *Just a few snacks – crisps* ***and that kind of thing***.
