# Promise

*Promise* is a noun and a verb.

A *promise* is something that you say you will definitely do:

- *I’ll be here for your birthday. That’s a **promise**!*

We often use the verb *make* with *promise*:

- *Beth **made a promise** to Owen that she would look after his dog whenever he was away. Now she regrets it.*

We can use the verb *promise* to say that we will definitely do something. We use it with a clause with *will, would* or with a *to*\-infinitive. It is sometimes followed by *that*:

- *I **promise** I’ll buy you another one.*
- Not: *~~I promise I buy you another one.~~*
- *I **promise** never to tell him.*
- *The builder **promised** that he would be here on Tuesday.*

We can use the modal verb *will* to make promises:

- *I**’ll** always remember you.*
- *We**’ll** send you the contract tomorrow.*
