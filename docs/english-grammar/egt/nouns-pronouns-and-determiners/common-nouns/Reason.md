# Reason

## Reason for

We use *reason for +* noun phrase, not *reason of*:

- *What’s the **reason for** the delay? We’ve been waiting more than an hour.*
- Not: *~~What is the reason of the delay?~~*
- *There were several **reasons for** his strange behaviour.*

We normally only use *of* after *reason* in the formal expression *for reasons of*:

- *The government claims the new law is necessary **for reasons of national security**.*

## Reason why

We use *reason why* before a clause. We often omit *why*, especially in statements:

- *The **reason** (**why**) I didn’t contact you was that I was only in town for a few hours.*

:::warning

We don’t say *reason because*:

- *Is there a **reason why** you just listed people’s initials and not their full names?*
- Not: *~~Is there a reason because you~~* …

:::

:::note[See also]

- *When* as a relative pronoun

:::

## Reason that

We use *reason that* before a clause. We often omit *that*, especially in statements. *Reason that* is less common and slightly more formal than *reason why*:

- *The **reason** (**that**) we need new guidelines is that the present ones are just not working.*
- *One **reason*** ***that** the panel could not decide who was the best person for the job was that the interview times were too short.*

We do not use *reason* in the plural with a *that*\-clause:

- *There are several **reasons why** I don’t like the book.*
- Not: *~~There are several reasons that~~* …

## Reason \+ to\-infinitive

We can use *reason* with a *to*\-infinitive:

- *There’s no **reason to be** suspicious – everything, is perfectly normal.*
- *You have every **reason to demand** a guarantee in writing. I would do that at once, if I were you.*
