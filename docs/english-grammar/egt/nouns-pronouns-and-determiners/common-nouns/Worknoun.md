# Work (noun)

## Work as an uncountable noun

*Work* is an uncountable noun when it means something we do that takes an effort, often as part of a job or for study:

- *Hard **work** is good for you. It keeps you fit.* (work as a physical activity)
- *I’m not going out tonight. I’ve got a lot of **work** to do. We’ve got exams next week.* (work as study)

:::warning

We don’t use *work* with the indefinite article (*a*) or in the plural. The word for a specific occupation or task is *job*, which is a countable noun:

- *They offered me **a job** in Helsinki, but Finland is a long way from home.*
- Not: *~~They offered me a work~~* …
- *We always have a lot of **jobs** to do round the house at weekends, like cleaning, washing clothes, gardening, and so on.*
- Not: … ~~a lot of works to do~~ …

:::

### At work

We can say that someone is *at work* when they are at the place where they work and are doing their job:

- *Can I ring you back later? I’m **at work** at the moment and I can’t really talk privately.*

## Work as a countable noun

*Work* as a countable noun means something created, especially a book or painting or piece of music or sculpture:

- *She bought me the complete **works** of Shakespeare for my birthday.*
- *Several **works** of art were stolen from the town museum yesterday.*
- *The statue is **a** beautiful new **work** by the Swedish sculptor Lars Ahlander.*
