# Determiners and types of noun

We cannot use all the determiners with all types of noun. We can use some determiners with any type of noun, but others must be followed by certain types of noun.

## Determiners and singular countable nouns

Some determiners can only be used with a singular countable noun. These are:

- a/an
- another
- each
- either
- every
- neither
- one

*Would you like **another glass** of water?*

*Life gets more expensive **every day**.*

A: *Can we meet on the 15th or 16th?*

B: *Sorry*. ***Neither date*** *is good for me. What about the 18th?*

- Each
- *Every*
- *Other*

:::

## Determiners and singular uncountable nouns

*Much*, *(a) little, less* and *least* can only be used with a singular uncountable noun:

- *We didn’t get **much snow** last winter.*
- *There is **little information** I can give you, I’m afraid.*

We sometimes use *less* with plural nouns, but this is not always considered correct:

- *There were **less children** there today than last year.* (*There were fewer children*… is considered correct.)

- *Much*
- *Little*, *a little*, *few*, *a few*
- *Less* or *fewer*?

:::

## Determiners and singular countable or uncountable nouns

We use *this* and *that* with singular countable or uncountable nouns, but not with plural nouns. *This* refers to something near the speaker; *that* refers to something further away:

- ***That film*** *was fantastic.* (countable)
- ***This furniture*** *is so ugly!* (uncountable)

For plural nouns, we use *these* and *those*.

- *This*, *that*, *these*, *those*

## Determiners and plural countable nouns

*Both, many, (a) few*, the numbers *two, three, four*, etc., *several*, *these* and *those* are only used with plural nouns:

- *It all happened **many years** ago.*
- *I just have **a few photos** of my grandparents.*
- ***Several items*** *were missing when we opened the box to unpack everything.*

## Determiners and uncountable nouns or plural countable nouns

Some determiners can only be used with an uncountable noun or with a plural noun:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>all</i></td><td><i>some</i> /səm/ (weak form)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>any</i> (weak form)</td><td>zero determiner (i.e. no determiner)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>enough</i></td><td><br/></td></tr></tbody></table>

*Would you like **some juice**, or milk?* (uncountable noun)

## Determiners and any type of noun

Some determiners can be used with any type of noun, singular or plural, countable or uncountable.

Determiners which can be used in this way:

- any (‘strong form’ meaning ‘it doesn’t matter which’)
- some (‘strong form’ meaning ‘certain/particular’; stressed and pronounced /sʌm/)
- which (as a question word)
- what (as a question word)
- my, your, his, Anna’s, etc.
- such
- the
- what
- whose
- no
