# Possession (John’s car, a friend of mine)

## Possessive ’s

We use apostrophe *s* (*’s*), also called possessive *’s*, as a determiner to show that something belongs to someone or something:

- *Is that Olivia**’s** bag?*
- *Britain**’s** coastline is very beautiful.*

We can also use it in complex noun phrases (underlined):

- *Greg is* her youngest daughter’s *husband.*

We can use two possessive *’s* constructions in the same noun phrase:

- *We went to **Jake’s father’s** funeral.*

We also use possessive *’s* to talk about time and duration:

- *Is that **yesterday’s** paper?*
- *I’ve only had one **week’s** holiday so far this year.*

### Rules for using possessive ’s

We use *’s* after a singular noun and *’* after a plural noun.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>singular noun + <b><i>’s</i></b></td><td>plural noun + ’</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>The</i> <i>girl’s bedroom</i>(The bedroom belongs to one girl.)</td><td><i>The</i> <i>girls’ bedroom</i>.(The bedroom belongs to more than one girl.)</td></tr></tbody></table>

We use *’s* with irregular plural nouns (e.g. *children, men, people, women*):

- *The **children’s** parents decided which university they would go to.*
- *They have no respect for other **people’s** property.*

The rules for the pronunciation of a noun with *’s* are the same as the rules for pronunciation of plural forms of nouns.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>noun + <b><i>’s</i></b> or <b><i>’</i></b></td><td>plural noun</td><td>pronunciation</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>The </i><b><i>cat’s</i></b><i> dinner is in the fridge.</i></td><td><i>The </i><b><i>cats</i></b><i> were running around the garden.</i></td><td>/s/</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>The </i><b><i>kids’</i></b><i> uncle gave them all some money.</i></td><td><i>The </i><b><i>kids</i></b><i> are getting impatient.</i></td><td>/z/</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>George’s</i></b><i> brother was there.</i></td><td><i>There are three </i><b><i>Georges</i></b><i> in my family.</i></td><td>/ɪz/</td></tr></tbody></table>

When a first or second name ends in *\-s*, we can either add *’* or *’s*. It is more common to use *’* than *’s*. When we speak, we usually pronounce the final part of the word as /zɪz/ or /sɪz/:

- *Is that James**’**car?* (or *Is that James**’s** car?*) (both usually pronounced /ˈdʒeɪmzɪz/)
- *I love Keats’ poetry.* (or *I love Keats’s poetry*.) (both usually pronounced /ˈki:tsɪz/)

With compound nouns, we add *’s* to the final noun:

- *My **sister-in-law’s** friend came with us.*
- Not: *~~My sister’s-in-law friend~~*

We don’t usually use the possessive *’s* with things:

- *the door handle*
- Not: *~~the door’s handle~~*

- *the shop window*
- Not: *~~the shop’s window~~*
- *the kitchen table*
- Not: *~~the kitchen’s table~~*

Spoken English:

When we talk about places which are familiar to the speaker and the listener, we sometimes don’t use the noun after possessive *’s*:

- *the hairdresser’s salon – the* ***hairdresser’s***
- *the doctor’s surgery – the* ***doctor’s***
- *We had to take our cat to the **vet’s** twice last month.* (the same as: *We had to take our cat to the vet’s clinic twice last month*.)
- *Do you shop in **Marks and Spencer’s**?*
- *We decided to go to **John’s** after the cinema.* (the same as: *We decided to go to John’s house after the cinema*.)

In short answers, we can omit the noun if it is not necessary to repeat it:

- A: *Is that your coat?*
- B: *No, it’s* ***Sandra’s***.

We use possessive *’s* with words such as *one, anyone, someone, anybody, somebody*:

- *It’s important to know **one’s** rights as a tenant.*
- *Is this **someone’s** coat here?*

When we use *else* with these words, the *’s* is added to *else*:

- *Why didn’t you come? **Everyone else’s** husband was there.*

:::warning

The pronoun *other* has the same forms as nouns. We add *’s* to the singular form, and we add an apostrophe after the plural -*s* ending in the plural form:

- *They took each **other’s** hand and started walking.*
- *All of our luggage arrived but the **others’** cases didn’t. The airline promise they will be here this evening.*

:::

:::warning

We don’t use *’s* with possessive pronouns:

- *Is that dog* ***yours?***
- Not: *~~Is that dog your’s?~~*
- *I think that car is **theirs**.*
- Not: *~~I think that car is theirs’~~*

:::

We don’t use *’s* with the possessive determiner *its. It’s* means ‘it is’:

- *The city is proud of **its** parks.*
- Not: *~~The city is proud of it’s parks.~~*

## Possessives with of

### Noun phrase + of \+ possessive pronoun

We can talk about possession using the pattern: noun phrase + *of* + possessive pronoun:

- *A friend **of** mine told me that all of the tickets have already sold out.*
- A: *Where’s Martin?*
- B: *He’s gone to pick up* *a cousin **of** his* *at the station*.
- *Is Linda McGrath a close friend **of** yours?*

:::warning

We use a possessive pronoun, not the object form of the pronoun:

- *A neighbour of **mine** called late last night.*
- Not: *~~A neighbour of me~~* …

:::

### Noun phrase + of \+ possessive ’s noun phrase

We can also use the noun phrase + *of* pattern before a noun phrase with possessive *’s*:

- *He’s a brother **of** Maria’s.*
- *A friend **of** my sister’s has opened a café on Dawson Street.*
- *She was a daughter **of** the President’s.*

## ’s or of or either?

There are some general rules about when to use *’s* and when to use *of* but there are many cases where both are possible:

- *The film’s hero or The hero of the film*
- *The car’s safety record or The safety record of the car*
- *The report’s conclusion or The conclusion of the report*

Sometimes when we first mention a noun, we use *of*, and later when we refer to it again, we use *’s*:

- *The **mountains of Pakistan** are mostly in the north. At least one hundred of them are above 7,000 metres … Most of **Pakistan’s mountains** are in the spectacular Karakoram range.*

### When we don’t use ’s

We don’t use *’s* when the noun is not a person, animal, country, organisation, etc., or when the noun phrase is very long:

- *The name **of the ship** was ‘Wonder Queen’.* (preferred to *The ship’s name was ‘Wonder Queen’*.)
- *The house of **the oldest woman in the village**.* (preferred to *The oldest woman in the village’s house*.)

### When we don’t use of

When we are talking about things that belong to us, relationships and characteristics of people, animals, countries, categories, groups or organisations made up of people, we usually use *’s*:

- *The **men’s** dressing room is on the left at the end of the corridor.*
- Not: *~~The dressing room of the men~~* …

- *The **cat’s** paw was badly cut.*
- Not: *~~The paw of the cat~~* …

- Possessive *’s*

## Possession: typical errors

We don’t use *’s* with plural nouns:

- *It’s my responsibility to deal with **customers’** complaints.*
- Not: … ~~to deal with customers's complaints.~~

The possessive determiner *its* has no apostrophe:

- *We bought this car because we liked **its** colour.*
- Not: … ~~because we liked it’s colour.~~

We don’t use *’s* to make nouns plural. When we want to show that something is plural, we add *\-s* without an apostrophe:

- *They had to rebuild the **roads** after the earthquake.*
- Not: *~~They had to rebuild the road’s~~* …
