# A/an and the

## A/an and the: meaning

*A/an* and *the* are articles. They are a type of determiner and they go before a noun.

*A/an* before a noun shows that what is referred to is not already known to the speaker, listener, writer and/or reader (it is the indefinite article):

- *Do you have **a** car?*
- A: *Do you live in **a** house*?
- B: *No, actually, I live in **an** apartment*.

*The* before a noun shows that what is referred to is already known to the speaker, listener, writer and/or reader (it is the definite article):

- *Where did we park **the** car?* (The speaker and the listener know what car is being referred to.)
- *We had to paint **the** apartment before we sold it.* (The speaker and the listener know what apartment is being referred to.)

*The* makes a noun specific.

### A/an and the with types of nouns

#### Countable nouns

We only use *a/an* with singular countable nouns:

- *I have **a** sister and **a** brother.*
- *That was **an** excellent meal.*

We can use *the* with singular and plural countable nouns:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>The</i></b><i> lion roared.</i></td><td><b><i>The</i></b><i> tree fell.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>The</i></b><i> lions roared.</i></td><td><b><i>The</i></b><i> trees fell.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Uncountable nouns

We don’t use *a/an* before uncountable nouns:

- *Could I have rice instead of potatoes with my fish?*
- Not: *~~Could I have a rice~~*

To talk about an individual quantity or more than one quantity of an uncountable noun, we use expressions such as *a bit of, a piece of* or *a* \[specific measure\] *of*:

- Not: *~~That’s an amazing news.~~*
- *We just made **a** big **bowl of** pasta.*

We only use *the* with general plural nouns when we are referring to a specific set within a general class of people or things.

We can make general nouns specific by using an article and adding more information after the noun.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>Life</i></b><i> is wonderful.</i> (life in general)</td><td><b><i>The life</i></b><i> of a soldier is full of danger.</i> (specifically the life of soldiers, not life in general)<i>She had </i><b><i>a life</i></b><i> of hard work.</i> (one specific life)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>History</i></b><i> sometimes repeats itself.</i> (history in general)</td><td><i>He wrote a book on </i><b><i>the history</i></b><i> of boxing.</i> (specifically the history of boxing)<i>The country has </i><b><i>a history</i></b><i> of going to war.</i> (one specific history of one country)</td></tr></tbody></table>
