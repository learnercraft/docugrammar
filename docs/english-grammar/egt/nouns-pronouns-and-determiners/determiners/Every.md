# Every

*Every* is a determiner.

## Every meaning ‘each member of a group’

We use *every* + singular noun to refer individually to all the members of a complete group of something:

- *There’s a photograph on the wall of **every** child in the school.*
- *Try to answer **every** question.*

When *every* refers to the subject of the clause, we use a singular verb:

- ***Every*** *player wants to be in a winning team.*
- Not: *~~Every player want~~* …
- ***Every*** *cook needs good knives and a chopping board.*

The negative of *every* is normally *not every*:

- ***Not every*** *noun has a plural form.*

We use singular pronouns and possessives to refer back to *every* + noun, especially in more formal styles, and especially when what we refer to is not human:

- ***Every store*** *has a manager in charge of* it*.*
- ***Every area*** *has its own park.*

In less formal styles, the pronoun or possessive may be plural:

- ***Every student*** *gets a laptop. They have to give it back at the end of the course.*
- ***Every user*** *has their own password.*

- *All* or *every*?
- *Each* or *every*?

## Every: regular situations

We use *every* with a singular noun to refer to something that happens regularly:

- *The festival is held **every August** in Budapest.*
- *I leave the house **every morning** at 6 am.*
- Not: *~~I leave the house every mornings at 6 am.~~*

We use *every* with a number and a plural noun to refer to regular intervals of time or numbers:

- *There are buses into town **every ten minutes**.*
- *He now works from home, travelling to Amsterdam **every two weeks**.*

## Every day or everyday?

We write two words when *every day* means *each day*. The adjective *everyday* is one word. It means ‘normal’ or ‘usual’:

- *The boys meet up **every day** in the park.*
- Not: *~~The boys meet up everyday in the park.~~*
- *In the Soviet Union, poetry was at the centre of **everyday** life.*

## Every single

We often use *single* with *every* to emphasise each member of a complete group of people or things:

- *He was the only player who played in **every single** match last season.*
- *I’ve got to photocopy **every single** page.*

## Every one or everyone?

We use *every one*, written as two words, to refer back to a noun we have already mentioned:

- *I received more than a hundred letters from him while I was away and I’ve kept **every one**.*

*Everyone*, written as one word, means ‘every person’:

- ***Everyone*** *enjoyed themselves.*

We use *every one of* before pronouns and determiners:

- *There are 107 two-letter words in the dictionary and John Catto, an Aberdeen lorry driver, knows **every one of** them.*
- *When Jenkins joined the bank, one of his first acts was to make **every one of** the bank’s employees reapply for their jobs.*

## Every other

We use *every other* to mean ‘alternate’:

- *We worked **every other** Sunday.* (One Sunday he worked, the next Sunday he didn’t work, the next Sunday he worked, etc.)
- *He works in Germany **every other** week.* (One week he works in Germany, the next week he doesn’t, the next week he does, etc.)

## Every: typical errors

We don’t use *every* on its own, without a noun or without *one*:

- *There were five rooms. **Every room** was decorated in a different style.*
- Not: *~~Every was decorated in a different style.~~*

We don’t use *every* with a plural noun:

- *I go swimming **every** day.*
- Not: *~~I go swimming every days.~~*
