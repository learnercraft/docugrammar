# Such

## Such as a determiner

We can use *such* (as a determiner) before a noun phrase to add emphasis:

- *We visited **such** fascinating places on our trip through central Asia.*
- *She has **such** lovely hair.*
- *She lived in **such** loneliness.* (formal)

We use *such* before the indefinite article, *a/an*:

- *We had **such*** ***an** awful meal at that restaurant!*
- Not: *~~We had a such awful meal~~* …

## Such meaning ‘of this or that kind’

In more formal situations, we can use s*uch* to mean ‘of this or that kind’. We can use it before *a/an* or after expressions like *the only, the first, the second*:

- *You must not destroy people’s houses. I could never agree to* ***such a plan.*** (a plan of that kind)
- *A college is offering a degree in pop music composition. It is the only **such** course in the country.* (the only course of that kind)

## Such … that

We can use a *that*\-clause after a noun phrase with *such*:

- *He is **such** a bad-tempered person **that** no one can work with him for long.*
- *It was **such** a long and difficult exam **that** I was completely exhausted at the end.*
