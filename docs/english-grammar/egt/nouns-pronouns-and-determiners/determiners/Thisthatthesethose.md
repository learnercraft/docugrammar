We often use *this* with words describing time and dates like *morning, afternoon, evening, week, month, year* to refer to ‘the one that’s coming’ or ‘the one we’re currently in’:

- *I’ll be with you some time **this evening**.*

## This, that, these, those as pronouns

### Referring to things or ideas

We normally use *this, that, these* and *those* as pronouns to refer to things or ideas:

- *Put the butter, chocolate and sugar in a saucepan. Heat **this** over a low flame until it melts.*

- \[talking about shoes\]

### Referring to people

We can use *this* and *that* as pronouns to refer to people when we want to identify ourselves or others, or to ask the identity of other speakers:

- *Is **that** your brother over there?*

We often do this in telephone calls and in answer-phone messages:

## This and these, that and those: uses

### Physical closeness and distance

We use *this* and *these* most commonly to point to things and people that are close to the speaker or writer, or things that are happening now:

- \[pointing to something\]
- *Is **this** what you mean?*
- *I’ll post **these** letters on my way home.*
- \[pointing to a pile of books\]
- *Do **these** belong to the Bradshaws?*

We use *that* and *those* most commonly to point to things and people which are not easy to identify in a situation. They are often more distant from the speaker, and sometimes closer to the listener:

- *What’s in **that** bottle over there?*
- *Could you blow out **those** candles near you?*

Sometimes they are not visible to either the speaker or listener:

- *Budapest! **That**’s my favourite place!*

- \[talking about a restaurant\]
- *I didn’t like the decoration. It had **those** awful paintings.*

### Shared knowledge and new information

We sometimes use *that* instead of *the* to refer the listener to shared knowledge, often when we are telling a story or explaining something:

- *You know **that** old shop on the corner? Well, they’re going to turn it into a restaurant.*
- We sometimes use *this* instead of *a/an* to refer to something important or recent, or to introduce a new person or thing in a story:

## Substitution with that, those

In formal contexts, we can use *that* and *those* as substitutes meaning ‘the one(s)’:

- *The most important information is **that** given at the beginning of the manual.* (*that* substitutes for *the information*)
- *The methods employed are **those** familiar to researchers.* (more formal than *The methods employed are the ones familiar to researchers*.)

In formal contexts, especially in academic style, we use *that of/those of* instead of *the one of/the ones of* or *the … one/the … ones*. This is preferred to the possessive *X*’s *one/X’s ones*:

- *The proton has a similar mass to **that of** a neutron.* (preferred to *The proton has a similar mass to the neutron’s*.)
- *The emotions in the poems are **those of** loss and grief.*
- Not: *~~The emotions in the poem are loss and grief ones~~*.

We normally only use *that* as a substitute for a thing, not for a person or animal:

- A: *Have you met Mr Kelly?*
- B: ***The one*** *who works at the town hall, or his brother?*
- A: ***The one*** *at the town hall*.
- Not: *~~That who works at the town hall.~~*

We can use *those* as a substitute for persons, animals or things:

- *There are sports facilities for guests. **Those** interested in golf can enjoy our eighteen-hole course.*
