# Noun phrases: uses

## Subjects and objects

We most typically use noun phrases as the subjects (s) and objects (o) of clauses (io = indirect object; do = direct object):

- *\[S\] **My father** wants to buy \[DO\] **a new car**.*
- *\[S\] **The agency** gave \[IO\] **him** \[DO\] **a few numbers to ring**.*

## Prepositional phrases

Noun phrases (underlined) are also used as part of prepositional phrases(in bold). They act as the complement of the preposition:

- *My parents gave me a mountain bike* ***for*** my birthday*.*
- *The coffee cups go* ***in*** the top cupboard*; the plates can just go* ***on*** the worktop*.*

## Adjuncts

Noun phrases also occur as adjuncts (ad) in some time expressions:

- *\[S\] **I** saw \[O\] **George** \[AD\] **last week** at the planning meeting.*

These include expressions such as *next year*, *this Thursday*, *most days*, *some* *years, one day, some day, the Monday before last, the day after tomorrow*.
