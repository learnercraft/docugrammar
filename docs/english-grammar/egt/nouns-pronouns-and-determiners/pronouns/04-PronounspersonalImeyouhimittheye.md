# Pronouns: personal (I, me, you, him, it, they, etc.)

We use personal pronouns in place of noun phrases. We often use them to refer back to people and things that we have already identified (underlined):

- Peter *complained to* the chef *about the meal. **She** wasn’t very helpful so **he** spoke to the manager.* (*she* = *the chef*, *he* = *Peter*)
- A: *Where’s* the knife*? I can’t find* ***it***.
- B: ***It****’s in the drawer*. (*it* = *the knife*)

Personal pronouns show person and number. *He, she, him* and *her* show gender. They have different subject and object forms (except *you*, *it* and *one* which have only one form):

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>subject</td><td>object</td><td>number</td><td>gender</td><td>person</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I</i></td><td><i>me</i></td><td>singular</td><td><br/></td><td>first</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>you</i></td><td><i>you</i></td><td>singular or plural</td><td><br/></td><td>second</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>he</i></td><td><i>him</i></td><td>singular</td><td>masculine</td><td>third</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>she</i></td><td><i>her</i></td><td>singular</td><td>feminine</td><td>third</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>it</i></td><td><i>it</i></td><td>singular</td><td><br/></td><td>third</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>we</i></td><td><i>us</i></td><td>plural</td><td><br/></td><td>first</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>they</i></td><td><i>them</i></td><td>plural</td><td><br/></td><td>third</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>one</i></td><td><i>one</i></td><td>generic</td><td><br/></td><td>third</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Subject and object pronouns

Personal subject pronouns act as the subject of a clause. We use them before a verb to show who is doing the verb. We do not usually leave out the pronoun:

- ***She*** *loves playing basketball.*
- Not: … ~~loves playing basketball.~~
- ***They*** *don’t finish the lesson until four o’clock.*
- ***It****’s getting late.*

We use personal object pronouns in all other positions, such as after the verb or after a preposition:

- *Paula’s coming to visit **us** in September.* (*us* = object)
- *Thanks again for everything you did for **me**.* (*for me* = prepositional phrase)

We also use personal object pronouns as complements of the verb *be*:

- *That’s **him**. That’s the man I was talking about.* (*him* = complement of *be*)

We can use some object pronouns (*me, him, her, us* and *them*) as short answers, particularly in informal speaking:

- A: *Who ate all the biscuits?*
- B: ***Me***. (or more formally: *I did*.)

## I, me

We use *I* and *me* to refer to the speaker or writer. *I* is the subject form and *me* is the object form:

- ***I*** *can’t come on Friday. **I**’m working.*
- ***I*** *am writing to apply for the position of …*
- *Helen asked **me** to get some milk.*
- *It’s **me**. Can you open the door? **I** haven’t got my key.* (*It is I*. is not often used. It is very formal.)

Spoken English:

We sometimes hear *me* used as a subject in informal speaking after another subject + *and*:

- *My friends and **me** went on holiday to a little town on the south coast.* (or *Me and my friends went on holiday …*; *My friends and I went …* is considered to be more correct.)

We sometimes use *us* to refer to *me* in informal speaking:

- *Pass **us** an orange, will you?*

## You

We use *you* to refer to the listener or reader. It is both the subject and the object form. *You* can refer to one person or more than one person. It is usually clear from the context whether *you* is singular or plural:

- *Paul, do **you** need any help?* (refers to one person, *Paul*)
- \[coach to team\]
- *The match starts at 10.30. I need* ***you to be here at 10.*** (refers to a group of people)

We sometimes use *you all* to address everyone in a group:

- *What would **you all** like to eat?*

In informal contexts, we also use *you* to refer to people in general, not someone specific:

- ***You*** *get a pension if **you**’re a man over the age of 65 or a woman over 60.*

## He, him; she, her

*He, him, she* and *her* are singular third person pronouns. *He* and *him* are the masculine forms. *She* and *her* are the feminine forms:

- A: *Have you seen Johnny Roberts recently?*
- B: *Yes I saw **him** in town last week*. ***He****’s looking really well*.
- ***She*** *didn’t like the way he spoke to **her**.*

Traditionally, *he* and *him* were used to refer to both genders in formal writing:

- *If anyone has any evidence to oppose this view, let **him** inform the police immediately.*

Nowadays, we often see gender neutral forms (e.g. *he or she, he/she, s/he, (s)he, they* and *him or her, him/her, them*) when we do not know if the person referred to is male or female:

- *The bank manager could help with your problem. **He or she** will probably be able to give you a loan.* (or *… **he/she** will probably be able to* *…* or *… **they** will probably be able to* *…*)
- *Go to a hairdresser. Ask **him or her** to come up with a style that suits you, your hair, your lifestyle.* (or *… ask **him/her** to come up with a style …* or *… ask **them** to come up with a style …*)
- *When you get into the building, go to the person on the desk in the reception area. **They** can tell you where to go.* (or ***He or she*** *can tell you where to go*.)

## It

We use *it* to refer to things:

- *My computer isn’t working. **It**’s crashed again. Can you have a look at **it**?*

We use *it* as an empty pronoun, also known as a ‘dummy’ subject, where there is no other subject to put in the subject position, particularly when referring to the weather or time:

- ***It****’s so lovely to see you.*
- ***It****’s already ten o’clock.*
- ***It****’s snowing.*

We usually use *it* to refer to countries, vehicles and machines. In some traditional styles, *she* was sometimes used, but this is now considered inappropriate by many people:

- *We spent three weeks in Malaysia. **It**’s a beautiful country.*
- *Three hours after the ship sailed, **it** developed engine trouble.* (or, more traditionally: *… she developed engine trouble*.)

## We, us

We use *we* and *us* to refer to different groups of people, but always including the speaker. *We* and *us* can refer to the speaker + the listener, or the speaker + other people but not the listener, or people in general including the speaker:

- ***We*** *could go and see a film tonight. What do you think?* (*we* = speaker + listener)
- *Gerald asked **us** if **we**’d drive to London and get you.* (*us/we* = speaker + others but not listener *you*)
- *Changing diet, rather than dieting, is a healthier alternative. There are changes **we** should all make.* (*we* = speaker + listener + all other people)

## They, them

We use *they* and *them* to refer to specific groups of people, things and animals:

- *The kids are getting on my nerves. **They**’re making so much noise. Can you tell **them** to be quiet? I’m trying to work.*
- A: *Have you seen my keys? I never remember where I’ve left* ***them***.
- B: ***They****’re by the front door*.

We also use *they* and *them* to refer to institutions or authorities, and groups of people in general:

- *I heard **they**’re going to publish a new edition of ‘War and Peace’.*
- ***They****’re opening the new motorway tomorrow.*
