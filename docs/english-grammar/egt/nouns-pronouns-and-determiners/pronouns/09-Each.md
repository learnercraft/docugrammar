# Each

*Each* is a determiner or a pronoun.

## Each: meaning and use

We use *each* to refer to the individual things or persons in a group of two or more:

- *We spent five days on the coast and **each** day we swam in the ocean.* (determiner)
- *There were four rooms, **each** with wonderful views of the garden.* (pronoun)

*Each* is usually followed by a singular noun or by *one*:

- ***Each*** *weekend, they would work on the house.*
- Not: *~~Each weekends~~* …
- *The houses were made of grey stones and mud bricks, and **each one** had a flat roof of pressed earth laid over mats.*

## Each of

We use *each of* before other determiners and before the plural object pronouns *us, you* and *them*:

- \[talking about a hiking club\]  
  A: *There are meetings every month to plan events*.  
  B: *That sounds like a lot of planning*.  
  C: *Do you go to **each of** the meetings?*  
  A: *I try to*.
- *They were trying to decide where to go on holiday but the problem was that **each of** them wanted to go to different places.*

When we use *each of* with a plural noun as subject, it’s normally followed by a singular verb:

- ***Each of*** *the buildings is surrounded by high metal fencing.*
- ***Each of*** *the horses has won major international races.*

Spoken English:

In informal speaking, you will hear people use a plural verb form:

- A: *All twelve of us have decided to go to Argentina together*.  
  B: *How will you travel around?*  
  A: *We’ve divided ourselves into three groups and **each of** the groups have hired a car*.

For emphasis, we use *each one of* with determiners and pronouns. When the phrase *each one of* is the subject, the verb is singular:

- ***Each one of*** *the passport control desks now* has *a camera as well as a computer.*

## Each \+ pronouns and possessives

We use *each* with plural pronouns and possessives, especially when we don’t want to say *he/she, women/men*, etc.:

- ***Each*** *person who joins the gym gets a free bag and **they** get a pass to bring a friend for a free visit.* (*Each person* and *they* avoids saying *each man and woman* and *he*, *she*.)
- ***Each member*** *of the community should take pride in **their** local environment.*

## Each referring to a subject

When we use *each* to refer to the subject of the clause, it usually appears in the normal mid position for adverbs, between the subject and the main verb, after the modal verb or first auxiliary verb, or after *be* as a main verb:

- *We **each** agreed to help by contributing some money towards the cost.*
- *We would **each** say a poem or sing a song.*
- *Have you **each** signed the contract?*
- *Husband and wife are **each** entitled to invest up to the maximum of £40,000.*
