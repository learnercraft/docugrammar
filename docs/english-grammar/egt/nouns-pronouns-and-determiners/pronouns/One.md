# One

We commonly use *one* and its plural *ones* as a substitute for a countable noun:

- A: *What about a cake?*
- B: *All right. Thank you. But I’m trying to slim, so I’ll just have a small* ***one***.
- A: *Can you fetch the DVDs from the shop?*
- B: *Which **ones**?*
- A: *The **ones** we ordered last week. The musicals*.

We don’t use *one* to refer back to uncountable nouns:

- A: *Have you got any milk?*
- B: *Yes*.
- A: *Can I borrow **some**?*
- Not: *~~Can I borrow one?~~*

As a noun substitute, we don’t use *ones* immediately after *some, any, both* and numbers, unless it is premodified:

- A: *Are there any mangoes for dessert today?*
- B: *Yes, Nuala bought **some** at the supermarket*.
- Not: … ~~bought some ones at~~ …
- A: *How many pens did you buy?*
- B: *I bought* four green ***ones*** *and* six red ***ones***. *That should be OK, shouldn’t it?* (The underlined words are premodifiers.)

In informal English, *my, his, her*, etc. (possessive determiners) can come before *one*. This makes the statement more emphatic:

- A: *I couldn’t use my laptop today*.
- B: *Neither could I*. ***My one*** *got stolen*. (more emphatic than ***Mine*** *got stolen*.)

When *one* refers back to a previous noun and is premodified, a determiner (*a/an*, *the, this, your*) must be used:

- *The hotel that we had booked turned out to be* a luxury ***one****.*
- Not: *~~The hotel that we had booked turned out to be luxury one.~~*
- *I liked all your songs, but Yesterday was* your best ***one***.
