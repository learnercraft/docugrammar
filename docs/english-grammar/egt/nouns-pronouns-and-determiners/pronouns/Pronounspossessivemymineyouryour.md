# Pronouns: possessive (my, mine, your, yours, etc.)

We use pronouns to refer to possession and ‘belonging’. There are two types: possessive pronouns and possessive determiners. We use possessive determiners before a noun. We use possessive pronouns in place of a noun:

- *Is that \[determiner\] **your** scarf? It’s very similar to \[pronoun\] **mine**.* (It’s very similar to my scarf.)
- *That’s not \[determiner\] **their** house. \[pronoun\] **Theirs** has got a red front door.*
- *It was \[determiner\] **his** fault not \[pronoun\] **hers**.*

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>personal pronoun</td><td>possessive determiner</td><td>possessive pronoun</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I</i></td><td><i>my</i></td><td><i>mine</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>you</i> (singular and plural)</td><td><i>your</i></td><td><i>yours</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>he</i></td><td><i>his</i></td><td><i>his</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>she</i></td><td><i>her</i></td><td><i>hers</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>it</i></td><td><i>its</i></td><td><i>its*</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>we</i></td><td><i>our</i></td><td><i>ours</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>they</i></td><td><i>their</i></td><td><i>theirs</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>one</i></td><td><i>one’s</i></td><td><i>one’s*</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

\*We avoid using *its* and *one’s* as possessive pronouns except when we use them with *own*:

- *The house seemed asleep yet, as I have said, it had a life of **its own**.*
- *One doesn’t like to spend too much time on **one’s own**.*

## Typical errors

We don’t use *’s* after possessive pronouns:

- *Are those gloves **hers**?*
- Not: *~~Are those gloves her’s?~~*

*’s* is not used with the possessive pronoun *its. It’s* means ‘it is’:

- *The team is proud of **its** ability to perform consistently well.*
- Not: … ~~proud of it’s ability~~ …

We don’t use another determiner with a possessive determiner:

- *I’m going to get **my** hair cut this afternoon.*
- Not: … ~~get the my hair cut~~ …

We don’t use possessive determiners on their own. They are always at the beginning of noun phrases:

- *That’s not **my** book. It’s **yours**.* (or *It’s* ***your*** ***book***.)
- Not: *~~It’s your~~*.

We don’t use possessive pronouns before nouns:

- *Lots of **our** friends were at the party.*
- Not: *~~Lots of ours friends~~* …
