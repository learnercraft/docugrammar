# Pronouns: reflexive (myself, themselves, etc.)

Reflexive pronouns end in -*self* or -*selves*. They refer back to the subject forms of personal pronouns (underlined in the example below):

- We *didn’t decorate it **ourselves**. Someone else did it for us.*

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>subject pronoun</td><td>reflexive pronoun</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I</i></td><td><i>myself</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>you</i> (singular)</td><td><i>yourself</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>he</i></td><td><i>himself</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>she</i></td><td><i>herself</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>it</i></td><td><i>itself</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>one</i></td><td><i>oneself</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>we</i></td><td><i>ourselves</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>you</i> (plural)</td><td><i>yourselves</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>they</i></td><td><i>themselves</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Reflexive pronouns for same subject and object

We often use reflexive pronouns when the subject and the object of the verb refer to the same person or thing:

- He *cut **himself** on the broken glass.*
- She *made **herself** a cup of tea and sat down in front of the television.*
- Parents *often blame **themselves** for the way their children behave.*

We use a reflexive pronoun to make it clear who or what is being referred to.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>Agnes looked at </i><b><i>herself</i></b><i> in the mirror.</i></td><td>The subject and the object are the same.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Agnes looked at </i><b><i>her</i></b><i> in the mirror.</i></td><td>The subject and the object are different. Agnes is looking at someone else in the mirror.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Reflexive pronouns for emphasis

We can use reflexive pronouns for emphasis:

- *The director of the company wrote to us **himself** to apologise for the dreadful service.* (or *The director of the company **himself** wrote to us to apologise for the dreadful service*.)

We don’t use reflexive pronouns on their own as the subject of a clause, but we can use them with a noun or pronoun to emphasise the subject:

- *Parents and teachers always pass on to children what **they themselves** have been told, and this has been going on for hundreds, or even thousands of years.*

## Reflexive pronouns + by meaning alone

We often use reflexive pronouns with *by* to mean ‘alone’ or ‘without any help’:

- *Why don’t you go **by yourself**?*
- *The children made the entire meal **by themselves**.*

## Reflexive pronouns for politeness

We sometimes use reflexive pronouns instead of personal pronouns for politeness, but not as the subject of a clause:

- *The National Trust is a charity depending on the support of people like **yourself**.* (or *… people like you*.)

:::warning

We don’t use reflexive pronouns with verbs of everyday actions unless we want to emphasise something:

- *She **washed** and **dressed** and had breakfast in the tiny kitchen.*
- Not: *~~She washed herself and dressed herself~~* …
