# A bit

We use *a bit* (*of*) or *bits* (*of*) to refer to quantities. The phrases can refer to both abstract and concrete things. They are an informal alternative to *some*, or *a piece of* or *pieces of*:

- *Do they need **a bit of** help with their luggage?* (or … ***some*** *help …*)
- *There were **bits of** glass everywhere.* (or … ***pieces of*** *glass …*)
- *Have you lost **a bit of** weight?* (or … ***some*** *weight?*)
- *The storm had broken the fence into **bits**.* (meaning ‘into small pieces’)

*A bit* or *bits* often have deliberately vague and informal meanings:

- *I’ve given him **a** few **bits of** advice.*

These words can also soften the meaning, so that a statement is not too direct:

- *Wearing those shoes is **a bit of** a problem for her, I’m afraid.*

We also use ***a bit*** to modify adjectives, or as an adverb. It is more informal than *a little*:

- *They had got **a bit** tired working in the garden.*
- *Can you wait **a bit** for us? We’re in heavy traffic.*

***A bit*** is also used to modify comparative adjectives and comparative determiners:

- *The climate in New Zealand was **a bit** nicer than we had expected.*

However, *a bit* and *a bit of* are not normally used to modify comparative adjectives before nouns:

- *It was **a bit** more entertaining than the last play we saw.*
- Not: *~~a bit more entertaining play.~~ or ~~a bit more of entertaining play.~~*
