# Most, the most, mostly

## Most

We use the quantifier *most* to talk about quantities, amounts and degree. We can use it with a noun (as a determiner) or without a noun (as a pronoun). We can also use it with adjectives and adverbs to form the superlative.

### Most with a noun

We use *most* with nouns to mean ‘the majority of’:

- *She plays tennis **most** mornings.*
- ***Most*** *tap water is drinkable.*

:::warning

We don’t use *the most* with this meaning:

- *The sun shines over 800 hours during June, July and August and on **most** days temperatures rise above 25 degrees.*
- Not: … ~~and on the most days~~ …

:::

When we are talking about the majority of something in general, we use *most* + noun. When we are talking about the majority of a specific set of something, we use *most of the* + noun.

He’d made </i><b><i>most of the</i></b><i> desserts himself.</i></td><td>A specific set of desserts (at the party)</td></tr></tbody></table>

When we use *most* before articles (*a/an, the*), demonstratives (*this, that*), possessives (*my, your*) or pronouns (*him, them*), we need *of*:

- ***Most of*** *the information was useful. Some of it wasn’t relevant.*
- Not: *~~Most the information~~* …
- *They sold **most of** their apartments quite quickly.*

:::warning

When there is no article, demonstrative or possessive pronoun, we don’t usually use *of*:

- *There hasn’t been much rain. **Most rivers** are below their normal levels.*
- Not: *~~Most of rivers are below their normal levels~~*.

:::

We use *most of* before geographical names:

- \[from a weather forecast\]
- ***Most of*** *England and Wales should be dry throughout the day.*

### Most without a noun

We can leave out the noun with *most* when the noun is obvious:

- \[talking about school lunches\]
- *Some children brought a packed lunch but **most** had a cooked meal in the canteen.* (most children)

:::note[See also]

- *Most*
- *Least*, *the least*, *at least*
- Adjectives: comparative and superlative

:::

## The most

*The most* is the superlative form of *many, much*. We use *the most* with different classes of words.

### The most with adjectives and adverbs

We use *the most* to make the superlative forms of longer adjectives and the majority of adverbs:

- *They’re using **the most** advanced technology in the world.* (+ adjective)
- \[the Lake District is an area in Britain\]
- *Scafell Pike is **the most** easily identifiable peak in the Lake District.* (+ adverb)

### The most with a noun

We use *the most* with a noun to mean ‘more/less than all of the others’:

- *Ian earns **the most** money in our family.*

We can leave out the noun when it is obvious:

- *He didn’t tell the best jokes but he told **the most**.* (the most jokes)

### The most with a verb

We use ***the most*** with a verb as an adverb:

- *They all cried, but Claire cried **the most**.*

:::note[See also]

- Superlative forms
- *Least*, *the least*, *at least*

:::

## Mostly

*Mostly* is an adverb that means ‘mainly’:

- *I am **mostly** interested in the history of the house.* (I am interested in other things about the house but my main interest is its history.)

We don’t use *mostly* instead of *most* or *the most*.
