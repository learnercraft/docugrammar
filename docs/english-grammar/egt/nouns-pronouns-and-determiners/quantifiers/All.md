# All

## All as a determiner

*All* means ‘every one’, ‘the complete number or amount’ or ‘the whole’. We use it most often as a determiner. We can use a countable noun or an uncountable noun after it:

- ***All*** *my friends are away at university.*
- ***All*** *tickets cost 25 pounds.*
- ***All*** *information about the new product is confidential.*

As a determiner, *all* comes before articles, possessives, demonstratives and numbers.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><br/></td><td>article</td><td>possessive</td><td>demonstrative</td><td>number</td><td><br/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>All</i></td><td><i>the</i></td><td><br/></td><td><br/></td><td><br/></td><td><i>trees had died.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>All</i></td><td><br/></td><td><i>my</i></td><td><br/></td><td><br/></td><td><i>family were at the party.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>All</i></td><td><br/></td><td><br/></td><td><i>this</i></td><td><br/></td><td><i>food must be eaten today.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>All</i></td><td><br/></td><td><br/></td><td><br/></td><td><i>25</i></td><td><i>students took the test.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

## All with no article

When *all* refers to a whole class of people or things, we don’t use *the*:

- ***All*** *children love stories.* (i.e. every child in the world)
- Not: *~~All the children love stories.~~*

We don’t use *the* with time expressions such as *all day*, *all night*, *week*, *all year*, *all summer*:

- *I spent **all day** looking for my car keys.*
- *The party went on **all night** and some of the neighbours complained.*

- *A/an* and *the*

:::

## All of

We use *all of* before personal pronouns (*us, them*), demonstrative pronouns (*this, that, these, those*) and relative pronouns (*whom, which*). The personal pronoun is in the object form:

- *I need to speak to **all of you** for a few minutes.*
- *He brought gifts for **all of us**.*
- *We had to contact the insurance firm and the airline, **all of which** took a lot of time.* (*all of which =* ‘contacting the insurance firm and the airline’)

With demonstratives (*this, that, these, those*) we can say *all of* or *all* without *of*:

- \[talking about a pile of kitchen waste\]
- ***All (of****) **this** has to go out into the rubbish bin.*

We often use *of* after *all* in definite noun phrases (i.e. before *the*, possessives and demonstratives), but it is not obligatory:

- ***All (of) the workers*** *were given a pay-rise at the end of the year.*
- *I gave **all (of) my old books** to my sister when she went to university.*
- *What shall we do with **all (of) this cardboard?** Throw it out?*

## All without of

We use *all*, not *all of*, before indefinite plural nouns referring to a whole class of people or things:

- ***All cats*** *love milk.*
- Not: *~~All of cats love milk.~~*
- *This book was written for **all children**, everywhere.*

We use *all*, not *all of*, before uncountable nouns:

- ***All junk food*** *is bad for you.*
- Not: *~~All of junk food is bad for you.~~*
- *I love **all music**, not just classical.*

:::warning

We don’t normally say *all people*; we say *everybody* or *everyone*:

- ***Everyone*** *wants to achieve their personal goals in life.*
- Not: *~~All people want to achieve~~* …

:::

## All with personal pronouns

When *all* refers to a personal pronoun which is the object in a clause, we can use pronoun + *all* or *all of* + pronoun. The pronoun is in the object form:

- *I used to have three pens but I’ve lost **them all**.* (or … *but I’ve lost* ***all of them***).
- Not: … ~~but I lost all them.~~

However, in short responses, *all of* must be used:

- A: *How many of these boxes are you going to need?*
- B: ***All of*** *them*.
- Not: *~~Them all.~~*

We use *all of* with the object form of the pronoun, even when the pronoun is the subject in the clause:

- ***All of us*** *are hoping for good news.*
- *A long line of people waited to speak to the officer. **All of them** had a story to tell.*

## All as a pronoun

We can use *all* alone as a pronoun in formal situations:

- ***All*** *were happy with the outcome.* (less formal: *Everyone was happy with the outcome*.)
- ***All*** *will be revealed to the public in 25 years’ time, when the cabinet papers are released.* (less formal: *Everything will be revealed to the public …*)

Usually, *all* as a pronoun is premodified or postmodified:

- *More than 100 people came to the refugee centre. **Almost all** had lost family members or property or both.*
- ***All that we had been told*** *turned out to be untrue.*

## All as an adverb

When *all* refers to the subject of a clause, it usually comes in the normal mid position for adverbs (between the subject and the main verb, or after the modal verb or first auxiliary verb, or after *be* as a main verb):

- *The kids **all** go to school on the same bus.*
- *These items could **all** have been bought cheaper on the Internet.*
- *The students are **all** here now. We can start.*

## All meaning ‘completely’ or ‘extremely’

We can also use *all* as an adverb meaning ‘completely’ or ‘extremely’, especially in informal styles:

- *He lived **all** alone in an old cottage in the woods.*
- *He came back **all** covered in mud.*
- *I lost a good friend, and **all** because of my stupidity.*
- *Maggie got **all** upset when she found out the house had been sold.* (informal)

## All: not all

We can make *all* negative by using *not* in front of it:

- ***Not all*** *the buses go to the main bus station, so be careful which one you get.*
- *We were**n’t all** happy with the result.*

:::note[See also]

- *All* or *every*?
- *All* or *whole*?
- *At all*

:::

## All: after all

We use *after all* in two main ways. We use it to mean ‘in spite of what happened before’. With this meaning it usually occurs in end position:

- \[spoken by someone who was previously not hungry\]
- *I think I might have something to eat now **after all**.*
- *She thought she would fail her driving test but she passed **after all**.*

*After all* can also mean ‘it should be remembered that’:

- *Why don’t you invite Nadia? **After all**, you do work with her every day.*

:::warning

*After all* does not mean ‘finally’ or ‘at last’:

- *We spoke about it and **finally** decided to sign the contract.*
- Not: … ~~and after all decided to sign the contract.~~
