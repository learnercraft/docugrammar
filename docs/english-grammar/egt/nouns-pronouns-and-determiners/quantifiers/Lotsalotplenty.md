# Lots, a lot, plenty

We use *lots*, *a lot* and *plenty* in informal styles to talk about quantities, amounts and degree. *Lots* and *a lot* are similar in meaning to *much* and *man*y. *Plenty* means ‘enough’ or ‘more than enough’. *Lots* is even more informal than *a lot*.

## Lots, a lot, plenty with a noun

When we use *lots, a lot* or *plenty* with a noun, we need *of*:

- *I’ve got **lots of** plans for today.*
- *There’ll be **a lot of** your friends there.*
- *There’s no need to rush. We’ve got **plenty of** time.*
- Not: *~~We’ve got plenty time.~~*

## Lots, a lot, plenty without a noun

We usually leave out the noun after *a lot, lots* and *plenty* when the noun is obvious. When there is no following noun, we don’t use *of*:

- A: *I haven’t got any money*
- B: *Don’t worry, I’ve got* ***plenty***. (plenty of money)
- *She didn’t bring anything to eat but we’ve got **lots** anyway.*
- Not: … ~~but we’ve got lots of anyway.~~

## Formal styles: a great deal of, a good deal of, a large number

We prefer to use expressions like *a great deal of* (+ singular uncountable nouns) or *a large number of* (+ plural nouns) in more formal styles:

- *There’s **a great deal of** truth in what he said.*
- *From here, **a large number of** roads led back to various parts of the city.*
