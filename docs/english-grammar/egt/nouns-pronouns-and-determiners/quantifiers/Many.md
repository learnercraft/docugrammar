# Many

We use *many* to refer to a large number of something countable. We most commonly use it in questions and in negative sentences:

- *Were there **many** children at the party?*
- *I **don’t** have **many** relatives. We’re a small family.*

We can use *many* with *not*, meaning *‘*few*’*:

- ***Not*** ***many*** *people realise that the mathematical notion of ‘zero’ is a relatively* *recent invention.*

We don’t normally use *many* alone before a noun in an affirmative statement:

- *There were **a lot of** people at the swimming pool this morning.*
- Not: *~~There were many people~~* …

However, we can sometimes use *many (of*) instead of *a lot of* or *lots of* in rather formal contexts in affirmative statements:

- ***Many*** *politicians have suffered at the hands of the popular press.* (formal)
- ***Many of*** *his friends and colleagues were shocked upon hearing of his sudden death.* (formal)

We often use *many* in formal situations in affirmative statements when the noun is followed by a relative clause (acting as a postmodifier):

- *There are **many** elderly people who have never touched a computer in their lives.*

We can modify *many* with *very, a great* or *so*:

- ***Very many*** *people have complained about the situation.*
- *There were **a great many** questions which were left unanswered at the end of the investigation.*
- *Why do **so many** people watch reality TV shows?*

We can use the expression *as many as* to talk about a high number that is surprising or shocking:

- ***As many as*** *5,000 people are believed to have died in the earthquake.*

We can use the expression *in as many* to mean ‘in the same number of’:

- *He doesn’t seem to be very lucky in love. He’s had three girlfriends **in as many** months.* (He’s had three girlfriends in three months.)
