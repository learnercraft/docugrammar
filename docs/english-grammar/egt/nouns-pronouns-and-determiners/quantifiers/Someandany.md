# Some and any

We use *some* and *any* in different types of clauses.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>+</td><td><i>He’s got some homework.</i>Not: <s>He’s got any homework.</s></td><td><i>Some</i> is most common in affirmative clauses.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>–</td><td><i>He hasn’t got any homework.</i>Not: <s>He hasn’t got some homework.</s></td><td><i>Any</i> is most common in negative clauses.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>? +</td><td><i>Has he got any homework?</i><i>Has he got some homework?</i></td><td><i>Any</i> is more common in questions but we can use <i>some</i> when we are expecting the answer to be ‘yes’.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>? −</td><td><i>Hasn’t he got any homework?</i><i>Hasn’t he got some homework?</i></td></tr></tbody></table>
