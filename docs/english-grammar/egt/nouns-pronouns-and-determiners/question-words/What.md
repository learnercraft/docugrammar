# What

*What* is a *wh*\-word. We use *what* to ask questions and as a pronoun and determiner.

## What as a question word

We can use *what* to ask for information about things and actions:

- ***What*** *do you want?*
- ***What****’s she doing? Tell her to stop at once!*
- ***What*** *time are you leaving?*

We can also use *what* in indirect questions:

- *She asked me **what** my address was.*
- *I wonder **what** Jim Barfield is doing these days.*

## What meaning ‘please repeat’

We can use *what* in informal situations to ask someone to repeat something if we don’t hear it or understand it:

- A: *Did you get the paper?*
- B: *Sorry*, ***what****?* (*sorry* alone would be more polite)
- A: *Did you get the paper?*
- B: *Oh, yes. It’s in the kitchen*.

## Emphatic questions with whatever and what on earth

We can ask emphatic questions using *whatever* or *what on earth* to express shock or surprise. We stress *ever* and *earth*:

- *Joan,* ***what***ever *are you doing? You’ll give yourself an electric shock!* (stronger than *What are you doing?*)
- ***What on*** earth *is she wearing? She looks awful in that red and white dress!* (stronger than *What is she wearing?*)

## What as a pronoun

We can use *what* as a pronoun to mean ‘the thing(s) that’:

- ***What*** *we need to do is make a list of useful phone numbers.* (the thing we need to do)
- *I can’t decide **what** to buy Liz for her birthday.*
- *I haven’t got many Beatles CDs, but you can borrow **what** I have.*

We don’t use *what* as a relative pronoun. We use *which*:

- *This is the book **which** the lecturer mentioned.*
- Not: … ~~the book what the lecturer mentioned.~~

## What as a determiner

We can use *what* in exclamations to express a strong feeling or opinion. In this case, we use *what* as a determiner before a noun or before *a/an* (+ adjective) + noun:

- ***What*** *lovely flowers!*
- ***What*** *a horrible smell!*
- ***What*** *a mess!*

## What … for?

We can use *what … for?* in two ways. We can use it in informal situations to mean *why?*:

- ***What*** *did you phone her **for**?* (informal: *Why did you phone her*?)

We can also use *what … for?* to ask about the purpose of something:

- A: ***What****’s that button **for**?* (What is the purpose of that button?)
- B: *It’s the on–off switch for the radio*.

## What: typical errors

We don’t use *what* as a relative pronoun:

- *The hotel **which** was least expensive turned out to be the best.*
- Not: *~~The hotel what was least expensive~~* …
- *She never asked our permission to use the room, **which** was very rude of her.*
- Not: … ~~what was very rude of her~~.

We don’t use *what* after words which take a *that*\-clause:

- *I am very happy **that** you can come and visit us.*
- Not: … ~~happy what you can come~~ …
