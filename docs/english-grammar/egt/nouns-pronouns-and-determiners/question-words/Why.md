# Why

*Why* is a *wh*\-word. We use *why* to talk about reasons and explanations.

## Why as a question word

We can use *why* to ask about reasons and explanations:

- ***Why*** *did he leave home when he was 16?*
- ***Why*** *didn’t you tell Gemma?*
- ***Why*** *is the Earth round?*

We can use *why* in indirect questions:

- *He asked me **why** I wanted to leave the job.*
- *I wonder **why** he told nobody he was getting married.*

We can use *why* on its own as a response:

- A: *I’m going home now*.
- B: ***Why****?*

When we reply to a negative statement, we usually say *why not*?:

- A: *I don’t like it here*.
- B: ***Why not?***

## Why: asking for reasons

When we ask for reasons in speaking, we can use the phrase *why is that?* In informal conversations we often say *why’s that?*:

- A: *Look, the moth is attracted to the light*.
- B: ***Why is that?***
- A: *I’m not sure*.
- A: *She’s not going to college this year*.
- B: ***Why’s that?***
- A: *She says she wants to travel for a while*.

We can use *why ever* or *why on earth* to add emphasis and to show shock or surprise. We usually stress *ever* and *earth*:

- A: *Beth has decided to go on holiday by herself this year*.
- B: ***Why*** ever *would anyone want to go on holiday alone?*
- ***Why on*** earth *has Julie bought me this expensive present?*

In informal contexts we sometimes use *what for?* with the same meaning of asking for a reason:

- A: *Ann’s going to be really upset with me*.
- B: ***What for?***
- A: *I forgot to call her back last night*.

:::warning

We don’t use *why* as a conjunction when we mean *because*:

- *I’m going home now **because** I’m tired.*
- Not: … ~~why I’m tired.~~

## That’s why …: giving reasons

We often use the phrase *that’s why* to give a reason:

- A: *Frank and Ellen have three children now*.
- B: ***That’s why*** *they moved house. They needed more space*.
- A: *Ian’s not been feeling well recently, has he?*
- B: *No*. ***That’s why*** *he’s taken some time off*.

## Why should …: expressing annoyance

When we are annoyed about something, we sometimes use the phrase *why should*:

- ***Why should*** *taxpayers have to pay more because the government has not managed its spending properly?*
- ***Why should*** *old people have to worry about health insurance?*

*Why should I?* as a response is very direct and rude:

- \[A is a mother and B is a child who is opening and closing the car window\]
- A: *Stop doing that*.
- B: ***Why should I?***

## Why don’t and why not: making suggestions

We use *why don’t* and *why not* to make suggestions:

- ***Why don’t*** *we leave the washing-up until tomorrow morning? It’s too late now.* (or ***Why not*** *leave the washing up* …)

## Why not?: showing agreement

We can use the phrase *why not?* as a reply which shows that we agree to a suggestion or request:

- A: *How about we invite Barbara and Gina round on Saturday night?*
- B: ***Why not****? We haven’t seen them in a long time*.

## Typical error

Be careful not to use *why* instead of *because*:

- *I have not placed an order for a long time **because** I am unhappy with the last delivery.*
- Not: *~~I have not placed an order for a long time why I am unhappy~~* …
