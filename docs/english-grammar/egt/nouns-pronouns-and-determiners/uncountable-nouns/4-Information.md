# Information

*Information* is an uncountable noun meaning ‘facts about someone or something’. It is often followed by *about*:

- A: *Can I help you?*
- B: *Can you give us some **information about** restaurants in the area, please?*

:::warning

We do not use *information* in the plural form and we do not use it with *a/an*. We use *piece* or *pieces* to make *information* countable:

- *I found a lot of **information** about Ecuador on the Internet.*
- Not: *~~I found a lot of informations about Ecuador~~* …
- *She told me **an** interesting **piece of information** about the new manager.*
- Not: *~~She told me an interesting information~~* …

:::

In more formal contexts, *information* may be followed by *on*:

- *The report included **information on** family incomes in 2006.*
- *The airline’s website gives **information on** hand baggage.*
