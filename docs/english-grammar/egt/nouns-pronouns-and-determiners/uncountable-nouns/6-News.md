# News

We use the uncountable noun *news* to mean ‘information or reports about recent events’. It takes a singular verb:

- *The **news** is good about Mary. The doctors are very happy about her progress.*
- Not: *~~The news are good about Mary~~*.

- *Do you have **any news** of your sister? How is she these days?*
- *I’ve got **some news** for you – I’m getting married!*
- Not: *~~I’ve got a news for you~~* …

If we want to talk about *news* as an individual thing, we can use *bit of, piece* *of* or *item of* (more formal):

- *I heard a couple of interesting **pieces of news** the other day about the company’s plans for expansion.*
- *An **item of news** caught her eye in the newspaper. It was about a child who was missing.*

We say *the news* when we refer to the television or radio programme that gives reports of recent events:

- *I always watch **the news** on CNN before I go to bed.*
