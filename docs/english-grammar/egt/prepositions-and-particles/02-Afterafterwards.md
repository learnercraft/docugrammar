# After, afterwards

## After as a preposition and conjunction

*After* means ‘later than’ and ‘next in time or place’.

*After* can be used before a noun phrase (as a preposition):

- *Shall we have a swim **after** lunch?*
- *The bank is just **after** the park, on the left.*

*After* can introduce a clause (as a conjunction):

- ***After*** *I left him a message, he phoned me immediately.*
- *She did voluntary work in a hospital **after** she graduated.*

:::warning

We use the present simple following *after* when referring to the future:

- *I’ll contact you **after** we reach the airport.*

## After or afterwards as an adverb

We can use *after* as an adverb, but *afterwards* is more common. When *after* is used, it is usually as part of an adverb phrase:

- *They lived happily **ever after**.* (means ‘for ever’)
- *She had an operation on her leg and **afterwards** was unable to walk for at least a month.*

:::note[See also]

- *Before*
- *Finally*, *at last*, *lastly* or *in the end*?

:::

## After: typical error

When *after* refers to future time, we use the present simple, not the future with *shall* or *will*:

- *I’ll do another course after I **finish** this one.*
- Not: … ~~after I will finish~~ …
