## Below meaning ‘lower than’

- \[a teacher talking to a class\]
- *Open your exercise book on page 27. Just **below** the picture there are some questions. Look at the picture and answer the questions.*

When the adverb *below* is used to modify a noun, it follows the noun:

We use the adverb *below* when referring to the lower level or deck of a boat or ship:

## Below: typical error

We don’t use *below* when one thing touches or covers or hides something else; we usually use *under* instead:

- Not: *~~Below a white coat~~* …
