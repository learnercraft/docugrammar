# Beneath

*Beneath* is a preposition or an adverb.

## Beneath: meaning and use

*Beneath* means ‘at a lower level than’.

*Beneath* is most common in formal writing. We don’t use it often in informal speaking. In speaking, *under* and *below* are much more common.

### Beneath as a preposition

We use *beneath* most commonly to describe the position of things which are at a lower level than something else:

- *Archaeologists discovered a gold cup just **beneath** the surface at the site of a Roman villa.*
- *The metro station is right **beneath** the airport.*

*Beneath* is particularly common when talking about the ground or surface directly under one’s feet:

- *She could feel the train coming because the ground **beneath** her feet was moving.*

### Beneath as an adverb

*Beneath* as an adverb isn’t very common and we mostly use it in formal writing:

- *She looked down from the balcony at the two men talking **beneath**.*
- *In the kitchen there was a modern sink with cupboards and drawers **beneath**.*

## Beneath, under or below?

*Beneath* has a meaning similar to *under* and *below* but we do not use it with numbers:

- *We bought it for just **under** 200 pounds.*
- Not: … ~~for just beneath 200 pounds.~~
- *The temperature was **below** zero all that week.*
- Not: *~~The temperature was beneath~~* …

We use *beneath*, not *under*, to talk about things which are at a lower level in terms of a person’s abilities, status or expectations. We often use *beneath* not *under* when someone feels that they are too important or too intelligent to do something:

- \[A student is commenting on a language course\]
- *The writing and grammar courses were good but maybe a bit **beneath** my expectations.*
- Not: … ~~maybe a bit under my expectations.~~
