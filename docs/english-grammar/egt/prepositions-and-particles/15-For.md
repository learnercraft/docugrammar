# For

*For* is usually a preposition and sometimes a conjunction.

## For: purpose

We use *for* to talk about a purpose or a reason for something:

- *I’m going **for** some breakfast. I’m really hungry.*
- *She leaves on Friday **for** a 15-day cruise around the Mediterranean.*
- *I wear these old trousers **for** painting.*

In questions we often use *what … for* instead of *why* to ask about the reason or purpose of something especially in informal situations:

- ***What*** *are you here **for**?*
- ***What*** *are they doing it **for**?*

- *For* + *\-ing*

## For someone

We often use *for* to introduce the person or people receiving something:

- *She bought a teapot **for** her sister.*
- *Mike Cranham and his staff at the hotel cook **for** 800 people a day, on average.*

## For: duration

We use *for* with a period of time to refer to duration (how long something lasts):

- *There’s a lovely open-air pool near us. We usually go there **for** a couple of hours in the evenings when it’s warm enough.*

:::warning

Don’t confuse *for* and *in* when referring to time:

- *We’re going to Cape Town **for** two months.* (We will spend two months in Cape Town.)
- *We’re going to Cape Town **in** two months.* (We’re leaving to go to Cape Town two months from now.)

:::

After a negative we can use *for* and *in* with the same meaning. *In* is particularly common in American English:

- *I haven’t seen him **in** five years.* (or ***for*** *five years*.)

## For: exchange

We use *for* to refer to an exchange:

- \[sign in a food shop\]
- *2 **for** £2 or £1.36 each.* (Two for two pounds or one pound thirty-six each.)
- *I got 124 euros **for** 100 pounds at today’s exchange rate.*

## For meaning because

We sometimes use *for* as a conjunction meaning ‘because’. We use it in very formal, and often literary, contexts:

- *Chasing the white stag through the forests, never catching it, of course, **for** it is a creature of legend.*

## For in multi-word verbs

We often combine *for* with a verb to form a multi-word verb:

- *She’s been **caring*** ***for** her mother for years.*
- *It’s not a good time to **look*** ***for** it now. We have to go.*

You will find other multi-word verbs with *for* in a good learner’s dictionary.
