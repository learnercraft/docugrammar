# For \+ -ing

## For \+ \-ing: function

We use *for* + the *\-ing* form of a verb to talk about the function of something or how something is used:

- *I need something **for storing** CDs.*
- \[a PC is a personal computer\]
- *The PC is still the most popular tool **for developing** software systems.*

## For \+ \-ing: reason

We use *for* + the *\-ing* form of a verb to refer to the reason for something:

- *You should talk to Jane about it. You know, she’s famous **for being** a good listener.* (A lot of people know she’s such a good listener.)

## For \+ \-ing or to \+ infinitive?

:::warning

We don’t use *for* + -*ing* to express our purpose or intention. We use *to* + infinitive:

- *We’re going to Lisbon **to visit** my aunt.*
- Not: *~~We’re going to Lisbon for visiting my aunt~~. or … ~~for visit my aunt.~~*
- *He’s now studying **to be** a doctor.*
- Not: *~~He’s now studying for to be a doctor~~. or … ~~for being a doctor.~~*
- *You don’t need to bring anything. There’ll be sandwiches **to eat** and juice **to drink**.*
- Not: *~~There’ll be sandwiches for eat and juice for drink~~*.
