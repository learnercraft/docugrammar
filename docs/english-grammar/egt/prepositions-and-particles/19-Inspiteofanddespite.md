# In spite of and despite

*In spite of* and *despite* are prepositional expressions.

*In spite of* and *despite* have a similar meaning to *although* or *even though*. They express a contrast between two things. They are both more common in writing than in speaking. *Despite* is a little more formal than *in spite of*.

We usually use *in spite of* and *despite* with a noun:

- *He got the job **in spite of** his prison record.*
- \[recession is a time when the economy of a country is not good\]
- *John’s company is doing extremely well **despite** the recession.*

We can also use *in spite of* and *despite* with -*ing*:

- *He was very fast **in spite of** being terribly overweight.*
- *They arrived late **despite** leaving in plenty of time.*

:::warning

We don’t use a *that*\-clause after *in spite of* or *despite*. We use *in spite of the fact that* or *despite the fact that*:

- *When they arrived at Malaga it was hot, **in spite of the fact that** it was only the end of April.*
- Not: … ~~in spite of that it was only the end of April~~

:::

*In spite of* is written as three separate words. We never use *of* with *despite*:

- *They enjoyed the rides **in spite of** the long queues.* (or … ***despite*** *the long queues*.)
- Not: … ~~inspite the long queues~~ or … ~~despite of the long queues~~.

- *Although* or *though*?
- *Even* *though* and *even if*
