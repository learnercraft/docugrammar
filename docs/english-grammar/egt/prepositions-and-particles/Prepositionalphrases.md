# Prepositional phrases

## Prepositions and their complements

Prepositional phrases consist of a preposition and the words which follow it (a complement). The complement (underlined below) is most commonly a noun phrase or pronoun, but it can also be, an adverb phrase (usually one of place or time), a verb in the -*ing* form or, less commonly, a prepositional phrase or a *wh-*clause:

- *They first met* ***at*** a party*.* (preposition + noun phrase)
- *She was taken ill* ***during*** the film*.* (preposition + noun phrase)
- *Would you like to come* ***with*** me *please?* (preposition + pronoun)
- ***From*** there*, it’ll take you about half an hour to our house.* (preposition + adverb)
- ***Until*** quite recently*, no one knew about his paintings.* (preposition + adverb phrase)
- *She’s decided* ***on*** doing a Chinese language course*.* (preposition + -*ing* clause)
- Not: … ~~decided on to do~~ …
- *It’s a machine* ***for*** making ice-cream*.* (preposition + -*ing* clause)
- *If you can wait* ***until*** after my meeting with Jack*, we can talk then.* (preposition + prepositional phrase)
- *We were really surprised* ***at*** what they wrote*.* (preposition + *wh-*clause)

We can put an adverb before a preposition to modify it. This applies mainly to prepositions of time or place which are gradable (*above, before, far, deep, down, opposite*):

- *They’ve moved* far ***into*** *the country.*
- *They left the party* just ***before*** *us.*
- *You can’t miss it. His office is* almost ***opposite*** *the coffee machine.*

## Prepositional phrases after verbs

Prepositional phrases can be complements of verbs. If we need a special preposition to introduce the complement of the verb, we call such verbs ‘prepositional verbs’:

- *Do these keys **belong to** you?*
- *We’re not happy but we do **approve of** their decision.*

We sometimes use an adverb particle before the preposition. The verb + adverb particle + preposition structure forms a verb which has a single meaning. We call such verbs ‘phrasal prepositional verbs’. Their meaning is often not related to the meaning of the original verb:

- *She really **looks up to** her grandfather.* (admires)
- *We’re all **looking forward to** having a few days’ holiday together.* (anticipate with pleasure)
