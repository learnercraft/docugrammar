# Prepositions

## Prepositions: uses

We commonly use prepositions to show a relationship in space or time or a logical relationship between two or more people, places or things.

Prepositions are most commonly followed by a noun phrase or pronoun (underlined):

- *The last time I saw him he was walking* ***down*** the road*.*
- *I’ll meet you in the cafe* ***opposite*** the cinema*.*
- *It was difficult to sleep* ***during*** the flight*.*
- *It was the worst storm* ***since*** the 1980s*.*
- *Give that* ***to*** me*.*

There are over 100 prepositions in English. The most common single-word prepositions are:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>about</i></td><td><i>beside</i></td><td><i>near</i></td><td><i>to</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>above</i></td><td><i>between</i></td><td><i>of</i></td><td><i>towards</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>across</i></td><td><i>beyond</i></td><td><i>off</i></td><td><i>under</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>after</i></td><td><i>by</i></td><td><i>on</i></td><td><i>underneath</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>against</i></td><td><i>despite</i></td><td><i>onto</i></td><td><i>unlike</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>along</i></td><td><i>down</i></td><td><i>opposite</i></td><td><i>until</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>among</i></td><td><i>during</i></td><td><i>out</i></td><td><i>up</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>around</i></td><td><i>except</i></td><td><i>outside</i></td><td><i>upon</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>as</i></td><td><i>for</i></td><td><i>over</i></td><td><i>via</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>at</i></td><td><i>from</i></td><td><i>past</i></td><td><i>with</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>before</i></td><td><i>in</i></td><td><i>round</i></td><td><i>within</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>behind</i></td><td><i>inside</i></td><td><i>since</i></td><td><i>without</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>below</i></td><td><i>into</i></td><td><i>than</i></td><td><br/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>beneath</i></td><td><i>like</i></td><td><i>through</i></td><td><br/></td></tr></tbody></table>

Although most prepositions are single words, some pairs and groups of words operate like single prepositions:

- *They were unable to attend **because of** the bad weather in Ireland.*
- *Jack’ll be playing in the team **in place of** me.*
- ***In addition to*** *getting a large fine, both brothers were put in prison for three months.*
- *I always get nervous when I have to speak **in front of** an audience.*
- *We estimate that there’ll be **up to** 10,000 people at the concert.*

The most common prepositions that consist of groups of words are:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>ahead of</i></td><td><i>except for</i></td><td><i>instead of</i></td><td><i>owing to</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>apart from</i></td><td><i>in addition to</i></td><td><i>near to</i></td><td><i>such as</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>as for</i></td><td><i>in front of</i></td><td><i>on account of</i></td><td><i>thanks to</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>as well as</i></td><td><i>in place of</i></td><td><i>on top of</i></td><td><i>up to</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>because of</i></td><td><i>in spite of</i></td><td><i>out of</i></td><td><br/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>due to</i></td><td><i>inside of</i></td><td><i>outside of</i></td><td><br/></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Prepositions or conjunctions?

Some words which are prepositions also function as conjunctions. When we use a preposition that is followed by a clause, it is functioning as a conjunction; when we use a preposition that is followed by a noun phrase, it stays as a preposition. Among the most common are a*fter, as, before, since, until*:

- ***After*** *I’d met him last night, I texted his sister at once.* (conjunction)
- ***After*** *the meeting last night, I texted his sister at once.* (preposition)
- *We’ll just have to wait **until** they decide what to do.* (conjunction)
- *Okay, we’ll wait here **until** six o’clock.* (preposition)

## Prepositions or adverbs?

Several words which are prepositions also belong to the word class of adverbs. These include: *about, across, around, before, beyond, in, inside, near, opposite, outside, past, round, through, under, up, within*:

- *There were lots of people waiting for a taxi **outside** the club.* (preposition)
- A: *Where’s your cat?*
- B: *She’s* ***outside***. (adverb)
- *The gallery is **opposite** the Natural History Museum.* (preposition)
- A: *Can you tell me where the bus station is?*
- B: *It’s over there, just* ***opposite***. (adverb)

## Prepositions and abstract meanings

Common prepositions that show relationships of space often have abstract as well as concrete meanings.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>That map you need is </i><b><i>behind</i></b><i> the filing cabinet.</i>(basic spatial sense or position)</td><td><i>Everyone is </i><b><i>behind</i></b><i> the government.</i>(<i>behind</i> = gives support)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>Beyond</i></b><i> the hotel were beautiful mountains.</i>(basic spatial sense or position)</td><td><i>Learning Chinese in a year was </i><b><i>beyond</i></b><i> them all.</i>(<i>beyond</i> = too difficult for)</td></tr></tbody></table>

Some common prepositions such as *at, in* and *on* can have abstract meanings:

- *I think you will both need to discuss the problem **in** private.*
- *All three singers were dressed **in** black.*
- *You now have the next day **at** leisure and can do whatever you wish.*
- *Our dog stays **on** guard all night, even when he’s sleeping!*

## Prepositions and adjectives

We commonly use prepositions after adjectives. Here are the most common adjective + preposition patterns.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>adjectives</td><td>preposition</td><td>examples</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>aware, full</i></td><td><i>of</i></td><td><i>They weren’t </i><b><i>aware of</i></b><i> the time.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>different, separate</i></td><td><i>from</i></td><td><i>Is French very </i><b><i>different from</i></b><i> Spanish?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>due, similar</i></td><td><i>to</i></td><td><i>This picture is </i><b><i>similar to</i></b><i> the one in our living room.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>familiar, wrong</i></td><td><i>with</i></td><td><i>What’s </i><b><i>wrong with</i></b><i> Isabelle?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>good, surprised*</i></td><td><i>at</i></td><td><i>We were really </i><b><i>surprised at</i></b><i> the price of food in restaurants on our holiday.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>interested</i></td><td><i>in</i></td><td><i>Lots of people are </i><b><i>interested in</i></b><i> Grand Prix racing but I’m not.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>responsible, good</i></td><td><i>for</i></td><td><i>Exercise is </i><b><i>good for</i></b><i> everyone.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>worried, excited</i></td><td><i>about</i></td><td><i>We’re really </i><b><i>excited about</i></b><i> our trip to Argentina.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

\*We can also say *surprised* ***by***

## Prepositions and nouns

Many nouns have particular prepositions which normally follow them:

- *There’s been a large **increase in** the price of petrol.*
- *Does anyone know the **cause of** the fire?*

## Prepositions and verbs

Many verbs go together with prepositions to make prepositional verbs. These always have an object:

- *I just couldn’t **do without** my phone.*
- *Robert **accused** her **of** stealing his idea.*

Phrasal-prepositional verbs contain a verb, an adverb particle and a preposition (underlined). We cannot separate the particle and the preposition:

- *The taxi is due any minute. Can you* ***listen out*** for *it?*
- *I can’t* ***put up*** with *this noise any longer.*

## Prepositions: position and stranding

Traditional grammatical rules say that we should not have a preposition at the end of a clause or sentence. However, we sometimes do separate a preposition from the words which follow it (its complement). This is called preposition stranding, and it is common in informal styles:

- *She was someone **to whom** he could talk.* (formal)
- *She was someone **who** he could talk **to**.* (informal)
- ***Which*** *room are they having breakfast **in**?* (informal)
- ***In which*** *room are they having breakfast?* (formal)

If we leave out words that are clear from the context (ellipsis), we can use *wh-*questions with a *wh-*word + stranded preposition:

- A: *The office is moving next year*.
- B: *Really, where **to**?*

- A: *I’m going to buy some flowers online*.
- B: *Who **for**?*
- A: *My mother*.
