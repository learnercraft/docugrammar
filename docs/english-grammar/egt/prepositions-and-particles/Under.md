# Under

*Under* is a preposition. When we use *under* as a preposition, it is similar to *below*. We use *under* to talk about something that is below or lower than something else:

- *The cat is **under** the table.*
- *His shoes were **under** his bed.*

When we use *under*, we can also mean that one thing is touching or covering something else. We do not use *below* in this way:

- *The wreck of the Titanic still remains **under** the sea.*
- Not: … ~~below the sea.~~
- *He had hidden the money **under** the floorboards.*
- Not: … ~~below the floorboards.~~

We don’t use *under* to refer to something in a lower position than something else. We use *below*:

- *Venus is just **below** the moon right now.*
- Not: *~~Venus is just under the moon~~* …
