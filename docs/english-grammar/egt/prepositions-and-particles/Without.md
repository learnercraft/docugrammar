# Without

The preposition w*ithout* means ‘not having something’ or ‘lacking something’:

- *I can’t drink tea **without** milk.*
- *I found myself in a strange country, **without** money and with no one to turn to.*

When *without* is followed by a singular countable noun, we use *a/an*:

- *Don’t go out **without** a hat. It’s very cold.*
- Not: *~~Don’t go without hat.~~*

*Without* + -*ing* form can also mean ‘if someone does not do something’:

- *I couldn’t get the picture out of the frame **without*** ***breaking** the glass.* (if I did not break the glass)

## Typical errors

We don’t omit the indefinite article *a/an* after *without* + singular countable noun:

- *How can you live **without** a telephone nowadays?*
- Not: … ~~without telephone~~ …

We don’t use *without* to mean ‘apart from’ or ‘in addition to’:

- ***Apart from*** *my mother tongue, I can speak two other languages.*
- Not: *~~Without my mother-tongue~~* …

*Without* has a negative meaning. We don’t use another negative word immediately after it:

- *The flight was delayed and we had to wait for five hours **without*** ***anything** to eat or drink.*
- Not: … ~~without nothing to eat or drink~~.
