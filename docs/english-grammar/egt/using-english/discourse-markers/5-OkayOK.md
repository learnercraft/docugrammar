# Okay, OK

We use *okay* (also spelt *OK*) in informal language. We use it in different ways, as a discourse marker, adjective or adverb.

## Okay as a discourse marker

### Agreeing

We use *okay* as a response token to show that we understand, accept, or agree with what someone is saying:

- A: *I’ll see you at 5 in front of the library*.
- B: ***OK***. *See you later*.
- A: *Why don’t you get a lift with Raviv?*
- B: *Oh*, ***okay***.

### Changing topic or closing a conversation

We often use *okay* to show that we are moving on to a new topic or phase of conversation. This is common in situations where we are giving instructions:

- ***Okay****, let’s get into groups of four now.*
- \[piano teacher to pupil\]
- ***OK****, right, let’s see. Now, keep that hand ready, so it’s there when you want it.*

We also use *okay* to mark the end of a conversation:

- *Right, **okay**, take care of yourself. Bye.*

### Checking understanding

We often use *okay?* to check understanding. We usually put it in end position:

- *I know it’s difficult to talk … just nod or shake your head. **OK**?*
- *Tie it the opposite way … just like tying a shoelace really, **okay**?*

## Okay as an adjective

We often use *okay* as an adjective to say that something is not a problem, it’s ‘all right’:

- A: *Thanks for helping me out*.
- B: *That’s* ***OK***. *No problem*.
- A: *Sorry to keep you waiting*.
- B: *It’s* ***okay***.
- *‘It’s **OK**, just tell me what to do,’ I said. I think I was a bit afraid, but I was trying to sound calm.*

We often use *okay* to talk about our health:

- A: *How are you?*
- B: *I’m* ***okay***, *thanks*.
- \[talking about someone who has been very ill\]
- *She’s going to be **OK**.*

We use *okay* to say that a situation or state is satisfactory, neither very good or very bad:

- *‘What do you think of my plans?’ ‘They’re **okay**,’ Jenny said unenthusiastically.*

## Okay as an adverb

*Okay* is used as an adverb in informal speech, meaning ‘all right’, ‘neither well nor badly’:

- *Even though I had never slept in a tent, in a sleeping bag or had any experience canoeing, I did **OK**.*
- *The Internet was down all morning, but it seems to be working **okay** now.*
