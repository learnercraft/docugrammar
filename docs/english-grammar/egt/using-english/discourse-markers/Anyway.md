# Anyway

*Anyway* is an adverb.

We usually use *anyway* to mean ‘in spite of reasons or situations already mentioned’. We also use it as a discourse marker, especially in speaking, to make boundaries in what we are saying. *Anyway* can also mean ‘at least’. *Anyhow* has the same meanings as *anyway*.

## Anyway meaning ‘in spite of …’

We use *anyway* to contrast reasons or situations that have already been mentioned. It is usually used in end position:

- \[a couple are about to go for a walk\]
- A: *Is it raining, Greg?*
- B: *No, but bring a coat* ***anyway***. *It might rain*. (Bring a coat in spite of the fact that it is not raining now.)
- A: *You’re going on holiday tomorrow, aren’t you?*
- B: *Yeah. We’re going camping. Brian’s idea, not mine!*
- A: *I’m sure you’ll enjoy it* ***anyway***. *It’ll be fun*. (You’ll enjoy it in spite of the fact that you don’t really like camping.)

## Anyway as a discourse marker

Spoken English:

We often use *anyway* in speaking as a discourse marker. We use it to organise what we say so as to help the listener. In this case, we use it in front position. When we write it, it is followed by a comma.

To show a return to an earlier topic after an interruption

- A: *John’s wife died 10 years ago*. (main topic)
- B: *Would you like some more tea?*
- A: *Thanks, that’d be great*. ***Anyway****, after she died, he moved from Bristol and set up his own business in Manchester …* (*anyway* is used to bring conversation back to main topic)

To move to a new part of a story or argument

- *… there were lots of people in the park because it was such a nice day. People were enjoying having their lunch break, you know. **Anyway**, I suddenly realised that my bag was gone. …*

To show that a conversation is coming to an end

- \[on the telephone\]
- A: … *it’s such a pity you missed it*.
- B: *Absolutely. It sounded like such a great party*.
- A: ***Anyway***, *thanks for calling*.
