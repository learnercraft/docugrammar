# You see

We commonly use *you see* in speaking when we want to share knowledge with our listener or listeners. When we use *you see*, we assume that the listener or listeners do not have the knowledge that we want them to have:

- *OK, we’ll try to be there but, **you see**, since my accident, I’m a bit nervous about driving on the motorway.*
- ***You see****, I don’t think she likes folk music so I think she’ll say no.*

- Discourse markers (*so, right, okay*)
- *You know*
