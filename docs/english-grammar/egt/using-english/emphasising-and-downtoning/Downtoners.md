# Downtoners

Downtoners are words or phrases which reduce the force of another word or phrase. Downtoning is the opposite of emphasising. The most common downtoners are:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>a bit</i></td><td><i>a little bit, a tiny bit</i></td><td><i>hardly</i></td><td><i>slightly</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>a little</i></td><td><i>barely</i></td><td><i>(only) just</i></td><td><i>somewhat</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

These downtoners are adverbs, and we use them to modify verbs, adjectives or other adverbs:

- *I’m **a little bit** fed up with George – he’s so selfish.* (less strong than *I’m fed up with George*.)
- *I think he got **slightly** upset when we told him the news.*
- *I was **barely** 16 years old when I joined the army.*
- *You’ll have to speak up. I can **only just** hear you.*
- *The city has changed **somewhat** in the last ten years.* (*somewhat* is more formal than the other words in the list.)

## Downtoners: using vague language

We use vague language such as *kind of*…, *sort of* … or the suffix *\-ish* to reduce the force of a word or phrase:

- A: *Are you hungry?*
- B: *Well*, ***kind of***. (less strong than *Yes*.)
- *She had a **saddish** look on her face, I don’t know why.* (less strong than *She had a sad look on her face*.)
