# Invitations

When we give somebody an invitation, we ask if they would like to go somewhere or do something or have something. We can use the formal phrase *would you like (to*) and the more informal phrase *do you want (to*):

- ***Would you like to*** *come to dinner on Friday night?*
- *Karen, **would you like** some cake?*
- ***Do you want to*** *go for a coffee?*

We can accept or reject an invitation. *Thanks* on its own means ‘yes’:

### Accept

- A: *Frank*, ***would you like*** *a chocolate?*
- B: *Yes, please*.
- A: ***Would you like*** *to come to the cinema with us tonight?*
- B: ***Thanks***. *That would be great*.

### Reject

- A: ***Do you want*** *some more coffee?*
- B: ***No thanks****. I’m fine.*

A more forceful but polite way of inviting someone to do something is to use an imperative, including emphatic imperatives with *do:*

- ***Come*** *and join us.*
- ***Do*** *sit down anywhere you like.*
- ***Don’t be*** *afraid to ask if you want anything.*

We often use *you’ll have to* and *you must* when we are not specific about the time, for example *soon, in the New Year, some time:*

- ***You’ll have to*** *come over soon. (come over means ‘visit us’)*
- ***You must*** *come for a walk with us some time.*

We can also make invitations with *Why don’t you …?:*

- A: ***Why don’t you*** *join us for lunch on Sunday?*
- B: *Thanks, that’s very kind of you.*
