# Suggestions

If we make a suggestion, it means that we mention a possible course of action to someone. There are a number of expressions which we can use to make suggestions.

## How about/what about \+ -ing?

- ***How about*** *starting a book club?*
- ***What about*** *opening your present now?*

## How about \+ present simple?

- A: ***How about*** *I pick you up at eight o’clock on my way to the airport?*
- B: *Great. I’ll see you then*.

We often use *how about* and *what about* + noun phrase when we make suggestions about food or drink. These suggestions are invitations:

- A: *Are you hungry?*
- B: *Yeah*, ***how about*** *some lunch?*
- ***What about*** *a coffee?*

## Why not …? and why don’t …?

We can use *why not* to make a general suggestion. We often find it in advertising:

- ***Why not*** *take a break in the south-west?*
- ***Why not*** *treat yourself to a meal at the Icon Restaurant?*

We can use *why don’t …?* to make a specific suggestion:

- *You look really tired. **Why don’t** you take some time out and rest?*
- *It’s getting late in the evening now. **Why don’t** we stop now and work on this tomorrow morning?*

- *Why*

## Let’s … and let’s not …

We use *let’s* (*let us*) to make suggestions about doing something with someone:

- ***Let’s*** *call Michael and see if he knows how to fix it.*
- ***Let’s*** *make a curry tonight.*

We use *let’s not* to make negative suggestions:

- ***Let’s not*** *argue about this.*
- ***Let’s not*** *spend all night talking about my problems.*

- *Let*, *let’s*

## Could

We often use phrases with *could* to make suggestions. Some are neutral, some are strong. The negative form, *couldn’t*, is stronger than the affirmative form:

### Strong

- A: *I only have three chairs. There will be four of us for dinner*.
- B: ***Couldn’t*** *you use the one in your bedroom?*
- A: *I need to finish this essay by tonight*.
- B: ***Couldn’t*** *you get up early in the morning to finish it?*

### Neutral

- A: *I have nothing to wear to the party*.
- B: ***You could*** *wear your red dress and your black shoes*.
- A: *We’ll need to have at least £300 for the concert tickets, the accommodation and the train*.
- B: ***We*** ***could*** *cut lawns and wash cars and that kind of thing*. *Or **we*** ***could** borrow the money from our parents and pay them back*.

### Can’t you …?

We can use *can’t you* to make a strong suggestion. It can sound very direct when it is addressed to someone who is present:

- \[mother to child\]
- ***Can’t you*** *finish your homework before going?*
- \[a woman is talking about her husband who wants a new television\]
- A: *I think our television is fine. I don’t want it to be replaced really*.
- B: *Mm*.
- A: *And he’ll want one of those wide screens*.
- B: *Oh dear*. ***Can’t*** ***he*** *manage with the one you have?*

## I thought we might/could

We can use phrases with *I thought we might* or *I thought we could* to make weak suggestions, especially when we don’t want to sound too forceful:

- *On Saturday, **I thought we might** go to town and see the Farmers’ Market and then **I thought we could** have lunch in a nice little café by the river.*

## You could always

We can use the phrase *you could always* or *we could always* to make weak suggestions:

- A: *Oh no! We’re out of olive oil*.
- B: ***We could always*** *use butter. I know it’s not as healthy, but it’ll taste good*.

## There’s always

We use the phrase *there’s always* to make very weak suggestions. It is sometimes used when someone is trying to cheer someone up or trying to be funny:

- A: *How did it go?*
- B: *We lost four nil. That’s it for this year. We’re out of the championship now*.
- A: *Don’t worry*. ***There’s always*** *next year*.

- \[friends are chatting about the Beatles; Paul and Ringo are the names of two of its members\]
- A: *I always liked Paul*.
- B: *I once dreamt that I married Ringo*.
- A: *Oh no! That was a nightmare!*
- C: ***There’s always*** *divorce!*

We also use *suggest* and *shall* to make suggestions.
