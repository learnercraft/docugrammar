# Commands and instructions

## Giving commands

We often use an imperative in commands, and we also use *must*. They both sound very direct:

- ***Stop*** *talking now!* \[in class\]
- ***Don’t*** *press that button.* \[a father to his child\]
- *You **must** wear a coat. It’s raining.* \[a mother to a child\]

There are a number of ways of making commands sound more polite. We can add *please* at the end of what we say, or we can use a question form to make a command sound more like a request, or we can use *I’d like you to* + infinitive or *I’d be grateful if you’d* + infinitive without *to*:

- \[a boss to an assistant\]
- *Ask Max to sign this form and then send it off immediately **please**, Gwyn.*
- ***Will you*** *bring us the files on the Hanley case please, Maria?*
- ***I’d like you to bring*** *us four coffees at eleven when we take a break in the meeting.*
- ***I’d be grateful if you didn’t tell*** *anyone about this.*

### Public notices

Public notices often give direct commands using *no, do not* or *must*.

## Giving instructions

We use instructions to tell someone how to do something. We usually use imperatives. They do not sound too direct in this context:

- \[a cookery class\]
- ***Beat*** *four eggs, like this. Then **add** the flour gradually. **Don’t beat** the eggs too much though.*

- \[instructions on how to replace a missing button\]
- ***Thread*** *your needle with a piece of thread about 25 cm long. **Mark** the spot where you want the button. **Insert** the needle from the back of the fabric and **bring** it through …*

Spoken English:

In speaking, we often use the present simple when we are giving instructions and demonstrations, and we say *like so* meaning ‘like this’:

- ***You fold*** *the A4 piece of paper **like so**. Then **you glue** some shapes onto this side and **sprinkle** some glitter on it **like so**.*
