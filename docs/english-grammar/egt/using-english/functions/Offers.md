# Offers

When we offer, we ask someone if they would like to have something or if they would like us to do something for them. We usually say *yes, please* or *no, thanks* when we reply to offers.

### Offers of food or drinks

- A: ***Would you like*** *some cake?*
- B: *Oh yes, please. It looks delicious*.
- A: ***Can I get you*** *more juice?*
- B: *No, thanks*.

In more informal offers, we can use *want* or a noun phrase with a questioning intonation:

- ***Do you want*** *some more salad, Peter?*
- A: ***Want*** *some of my* *sandwich*?
- B: *No, thanks*.
- A: ***Tea?***
- B: *Oh yes, please*.

### Offers to do something for someone

- A: ***Shall I*** *wash the car?*
- B: *Oh, that would be great, thanks*.
- A: ***Would you like me to*** *walk you home?*
- B: *No, thanks*.

:::warning

We don’t use the present simple to offer to do something for someone. We most commonly use *’ll*:

- ***I’ll*** *do the ironing if you want.*
- Not: *~~I do the ironing~~* …
- *Jim’s doing nothing. **He’ll** walk the dog for you if you like.*

### Offers to do something in different situations

\[A is visiting B’s house. B is preparing dinner\]

- A: ***Is there anything I can do?***
- B: *Actually yes, you can chop these carrots while I wash the potatoes*.

\[in a shop, A is the shop assistant and B is the customer\]

- A: ***Can I help you?***
- B: *No, thanks. I’m just looking around*.

\[on a telephone helpline\]

- A: *Hi my name is Inez*. ***How may I help you?***
- B: *Well, there’s something wrong with my internet connection …*

:::

\[at an information desk\]

- A: ***What can I do for you?***
- B: *I’m interested in seeing the city centre. Is there a bus tour, or something like that, that I can take?*

When we are almost certain that a person would like something, we can use *let me*:

- ***Let me*** *get you some more soup.*
- ***Let me*** *carry your bag. That’s too heavy for you.*
