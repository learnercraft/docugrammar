# Requests

When we make a request, we ask someone for something, or we ask someone to do something.

## Asking for something

There are different ways of asking for something. We usually ask for something in a polite and indirect way, for example, using *can, could, would you mind if* and *may*:

- A: ***Can*** *I have the salt?*
- B: *Of course, here you are*.
- A: ***Could*** *I ask you the time, please?*
- B: *No problem. It’s quarter past four*.
- A: ***Would you mind if*** *I borrowed your pen, please?*
- B: *Of course, here you are*.
- A: ***May*** *I have the bill, please?* (*May* is more formal.)
- B: *Certainly, Madam*.

*I need* is very direct and is usually used for urgent requests:

- ***I*** ***need*** *a doctor.*
- ***I need*** *the fire extinguisher. Fast!*

*I want* is very direct and can sound impolite. We don’t normally use it to make requests unless we want to be very direct:

- ***I want*** *to speak to the manager right now. I am not leaving here until I get my money back.*

## Asking someone to do something

There are a number of ways of asking someone to do something in a polite and indirect way. We often use *please* to make our requests more polite:

- ***Could you*** *call a taxi for me, **please**?*
- ***Would you*** *ask Rose whether she has signed the card, **please**?*
- ***Would you mind*** *collecting my suit from the dry cleaner’s, **please**?*
- ***Do you think you could*** *come in ten minutes early tomorrow, before the presentation?*

We sometimes use *can you* and *will you* to make requests but they are more informal:

- *Mum, **can you** wake me at seven o’clock?*
- ***Will you*** *send me an email tomorrow just to remind me to book a hotel?*

*We need* is often used in work contexts by a boss or manager to ask for something to be done in a polite way:

- ***We need*** *to email the contract to Peter immediately.*
- ***We need*** *someone to go to the meeting in Paris on Wednesday. Bill can’t go.*

When we are not sure if someone will be able to do what we ask, we sometimes use *you wouldn’t …, would you?* or *you couldn’t …, could you?*:

- *You **wouldn’t** drop this into the post office for me,* ***would you?***
- *You **couldn’t** stop at a bank machine,* ***could you?***

In formal letters and formal emails, we can use the following expressions:

- *I **would be grateful if you could** send me more information about the course.*
- *We **would be most grateful if you could** send someone to meet us at the airport as we do not speak Japanese.*
