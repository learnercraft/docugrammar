# Telephoning

## Making and answering a telephone call

Here is the start of an informal telephone call between friends:

- \[B calls A\]
- A: *Hello*.
- B: *Hi, Kathryn*. (ways of saying hello)
- A: *How are you?*
- B: *Great, and you?* (ways of asking how are you?)
- A: *Good, thanks*.
- B: *I was wondering if you’d be interested in going to the cinema with me tonight?* (explaining why you called)

When you call someone you don’t know:

- \[B calls A\]
- A: *Hello*.
- B: *Hello, my name is Chloe Anderson, and I’m calling about the job you have advertised in the Evening Herald*. (caller identifies who they are and why they are calling)

:::warning

When we want to tell someone who we are, we say *my name is …, this is* … or *it’s* …:

- \[B calls A\]
- A: *Hello*.
- B: *Hi*. ***My name is Jenny*** *and your friend Cathy gave me your number*.
- A: *Oh yes, hello Jenny. Cathy has mentioned you*.
- *Hello. **My name is John Pierce.** I am calling about your advertisement in the local paper this week.*
- \[B calls A\]
- A: *Hello*.
- B: *Hello. Is that Ellie?*
- A: *No*, ***this is Carmel***.
- Not: *~~No, I’m Carmel~~*
- \[B calls A\]
- A: *Hello*.
- B: *Hi. Can I speak to Lesley?*
- A: *Who’s calling?*
- B: ***It’s Ian***. *I work with her*.

:::

In many languages you answer the phone by giving your name. In English we don’t unless we represent a company or an institution:

- \[B calls a beauty salon\]
- A: ***Tranquillity Beauty Salon. Maria speaking, how can I help you?***
- B: *I wonder if I could have an appointment for a facial tomorrow afternoon?*
- \[B calls an electrical company\]
- A: ***All Electrics. How can I help you?***
- B: *Could I speak to the manager, please?*
- A: *Certainly. I’ll put you through to her office*.

## Ending a phone call

We often use discourse markers such as *right* and *okay* when we want to end a call:

- A: *That was nice that you invited your mum around for her birthday. I bet she was so happy*.
- B: *Yeah. It was really nice*.
- A: ***Right***, *well I’d better be going*.
- B: ***Okay***, *thanks for calling, Liz*.
- A: ***Okay***, *bye, Mel*.
- B: *Bye*.

## Asking for someone

If we want to ask for someone, we say *can I speak to X please?* or *is X there please?* (more informal):

- A: *Hello*. ***Can I speak to Jackie, please?***
- B: *Speaking*. (This means that Jackie is the person who answered the phone.)
- A: *Hi*. ***Is Emma there, please?***
- B: *I’ll get her for you now*.

## Asking someone to wait

If we want to ask someone to wait, we usually say *can you hold (on) (a minute) please?*:

- A: *Is Carol there, please?*
- B: *Sure*. ***Can you hold on a minute please*** *and I’ll get her for you?*
- A: *Can I speak to Mr Peterson, please?*
- B: *Absolutely*. ***Can you just hold a second*** *and I’ll put you through to his office?*

## When someone is not available

When someone phones and asks to speak to someone who is not available, we say *X is not available* or *X is not here* or *X is not in his/her office* and we usually offer to take a message:

- A: *Can I speak to Laura Watts, please?*
- B: ***I’m afraid Laura is not available at the moment. Can I take a message?***
- A: *Can you tell her that Esther called and that I’ll call her back later*.
- A: *Can I speak to Mr Richard Nicks, please?*
- B: ***I’m afraid Mr Nicks is not in his office right now. Can I take a message?***
- A: *No, that’s fine. I’ll call back later*.
