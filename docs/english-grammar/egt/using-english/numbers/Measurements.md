# Measurements

## Area: length, width, depth and height

We use the nouns *length, width, depth* and *height* and the adjectives *long, wide, deep* and *high* to talk about area and size:

- A: *What **length** is the pool at the sports club?*
- B: *Eighteen metres, I think*.
- A: *And what about the* ***depth***?
- B: *It’s not very* ***deep***, *maybe a metre*.

- *The island is 11 miles **long** and 5 miles **wide**.*
- *We were travelling at a **height** of 10,000 metres above sea level.*
- *The statue is 3 metres **high**.*
- *The zoo insists on the mammals having a pool at least 10 metres **deep**, 30 metres **wide** and 150 metres **long**.*

We can use *by* instead of *long* and *wide*:

- *The island is 11 miles **by** 5 miles.*

### Tall or high?

We use *tall* for people, buildings and things that grow. Otherwise we use *high*:

- *She’s very **tall** for her age.*
- Not: *~~She’s very high for her age.~~*

- *The Burj Dubai will be the world’s **tallest** tower.*
- *The plants were two metres **tall**.*
- ***High*** *ceilings are common in Georgian houses.*
- *They built **high** walls around the garden.*

## Weight and volume

We use the verb *weigh* to measure weight:

- *The engine is designed to take minimum space and **weighs** 55 kg.*

We buy things (fruit, vegetables, flour, etc.) *by the kilo/pound*, etc:

- *We buy rice **by the kilo**, which works out cheaper.*

We use the verb *hold* to indicate volume:

- *The bath **holds** 500 litres before it overflows.*

## Frequency, speed, time

We use many different expressions to describe frequency, speed and time. Here are some of them:

### Frequency

- \[from a brochure describing a holiday villa\]
- *Linen is changed **weekly** and the villa is cleaned **twice a week**.*

### Speed

- *Each time you fill the bath, the water flows in at the rate of **15 litres per minute** through the cold tap and **12 litres per minute** through the hot tap (when they are fully turned on).*
- *The traffic moves at a fast pace; a speed of over **one hundred kilometres an hour** is not difficult.* (or … *100 kilometres* ***per hour***.)

### Time

- *You could hire the boats **by the hour**, and so they took one and rowed on the lake.*

:::warning

We use *a/an* or *per* when we talk about prices or times in relation to weights, speed and other times, not *the*:

- *This cheese is £12.50 **a** kilo.* (or *£12.50 **per** kilo*)
- Not: … ~~£12.50 the kilo~~
- *The speed limit in towns in the UK is 30 miles **per** hour.* (or *30 miles **an** hour*)
- Not: … ~~30 miles the hour.~~
- *It costs 20 pounds **an** hour to rent a boat on the lake.*
