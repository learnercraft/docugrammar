# Time

*Time* is a noun with a number of meanings. In some senses it is countable, and in others it is uncountable. A good learner’s dictionary will give you its many meanings and tell you whether it is countable or uncountable.

## Time: seconds, minutes, hours, years

We use *time* to refer to what is measured in seconds, minutes, hours and years as a whole. In this sense it is uncountable:

- *How much **time** do we have for this project?*
- *Children nowadays spend more **time** watching TV than playing.*
- Not: … ~~spend more times~~ …

In some expressions *time* is countable:

- *At a **time** in our history when technology is developing so fast, we can’t afford not to invest in Information Technology.*
- *I haven’t seen Brian for a long **time**.*

## Time: talking about clock or calendar time

When we talk about specific clock times, *time* is countable. We do not say *hour*:

- *What **time** is it now?*
- Not: *~~What hour is it?~~*
- *Is this a bad **time** to phone?*

- *Is the swimming pool open at that **time**?*
- Not: … ~~at that hour?~~

We use *in …’s time* to say when something will happen:

- *I’ll be finished college **in** three month**s’*** ***time**.*
- *I’ve ordered a new computer and it’ll be here **in** a week**’s*** ***time**.*

## On time and in time

We use *on time* to talk about timetabled events. If something is *on time*, it means that it is at the scheduled time. We often use *right on time* or, more informally, *dead* *on time* or *bang on time*, for emphasis:

- *The trains are usually* ***on time.*** (They arrive at the scheduled times, not early or late.)
- A: *It’s quarter to two. We’d better get back for the meeting*.
- B: *Don’t worry. These meetings never start* ***on time***.
- *I was lucky. The flight to Chicago arrived **right on time**, so I got my connection.*

We use *in time* to say we are not late and have enough time to do something. We use it with *for* plus a noun, or with a verb in the *to-*infinitive form:

- *If we leave here at about ten, we should arrive at the coast **in time** for lunch.*
- *I hope to be there **in time** to see you before lunch.* (early enough to have time to see you before lunch)

We often use the phrase *just in time* to emphasise that we have time to do something but are almost too late:

- *You’re **just in time** for lunch!*

## Time: referring to past events

We often use expressions with *time* to refer to past events (*the time, the time that, the time when*):

- *Remember **the time** your phone went off at Olivia and John’s wedding?*
- *I’ll never forget **the time that** we all dressed up as clowns for Elaine’s party.*
- ***One time when*** *I was driving home, I saw a strange guy hitchhiking.*

Children’s stories often begin with *Once upon a time*:

- ***Once upon a time****, there was a little girl called Cinderella …*

## Telling the time

### Asking the time

We can ask about the time in different ways:

- *What time is it, please?*
- *What’s the time, please, Mark?*
- *What time does the meeting start?*
- *Could you tell me the time, please?* (more formal)
- *At what time does the concert begin?* (formal and literary style)
- *What time do you make it?* (informal)
- *Have you got the time, please?*

### Saying the time

When we talk about time on a clock, we use *am* to refer to times between 12.00 in the night and 11.59 in the day and we use *pm* to refer to times between 12.00 in the day and 11.59 in the night:

- *I never get up before 10 **am**.*
- *We weren’t home until 1.00 **am**.*
- *It was 7.00 **pm** before the plane took off.*
- *We usually have a lunch break at 12.30 **pm**.*
- *9.00 nine o’clock*
- *9.05 five past nine or nine oh five*
- *9.10 ten past nine or nine ten*
- *9.15 quarter past nine or nine fifteen*
- *9.20 twenty past nine or nine twenty*
- *9.25 twenty-five past nine or nine twenty-five*
- *9.30 half past nine or nine thirty*
- *9.35 twenty-five to ten or nine thirty-five*
- *9.40 twenty to ten or nine forty*
- *9.45 quarter to ten or nine forty-five*
- *9.50 ten to ten or nine fifty*
- *9.55 five to ten or nine fifty-five*
- *10.00 ten o’clock*

We only use *o’clock* for the hour:

- *It’s ten o’clock.*
- Not: *~~It’s quarter past ten o’clock.~~*

For times outside five-minute intervals, we say *minutes past* or *minutes to*:

- *9.01 one minute past nine*
- *9.03 three minutes past nine*
- *9.36 twenty-four minutes to ten*
- *9.58 two minutes to ten*

We also use the twenty-four-hour clock, especially in formal writing and in timetables:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>The 24-hour clock</td><td>am and pm</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>09.00</i></td><td><i>9.00 am</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>11.45</i></td><td><i>11.45 am</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>13.15</i></td><td><i>1.15 pm</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>22.50</i></td><td><i>10.50 pm</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

\[13.00\]

*At **thirteen hundred** (**hours**), a bus will collect passengers from the front of the hotel.*

\[18.40\]

*The meeting ended at **eighteen forty**.*

### Short ways of saying the time

In informal situations, we often drop *o’clock*:

- *I usually get up at **seven** and I have to be at work by **nine**.* (= *I usually get up at **seven o’clock** and I have to be at work by* ***nine*** ***o’clock***.)

When the speaker and the listener both know the hour, they may not need to say it:

- A: *Is it **quarter past** yet?*
- B: *No, it’s only* ***ten past***. (For example, if A and B know that the hour is six, *quarter past* means *quarter past six* and *ten past* means *ten past six*.)
- \[A and B are going to the cinema to see a film that they know begins at eight o’clock. Their friend Karen is collecting them at 7.40.\]
- A: *What time is Karen picking us up?*
- B: *At* ***twenty to***.

Spoken English:

In informal speaking, we can leave out *past* in *half past*:

- A: *What time is it?*
- B: ***Half two***.

:::warning

This means 2.30, not 1.30.
