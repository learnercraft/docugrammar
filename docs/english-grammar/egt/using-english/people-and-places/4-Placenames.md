# Place names

### Buildings, monuments, cathedrals, etc

We use *the* with some names of buildings (we usually write *the* without a capital letter, *the Taj Mahal, the Alhambra, the Houses of Parliament, the Pentagon*) but not with others: *Stonehenge, Windsor Castle, St Paul’s Cathedral, Chichen Itza*.

### Roads, streets, etc

We use *the* with the names of major roads in a country: *the M6, the A40*, but not with the names of areas, squares, streets and roads in a town or city: *Broadway, Covent Garden, Times Square, Princes Street*.

### Facilities in a town or city

We usually use *the* with the names of hotels, cinemas, museums and art galleries: *the Marriott, the Louvre, the National Gallery*.

When we are referring to buildings or institutions that don’t include the name of a town or city, we use *the*: *the airport, the University Press*, but not when the name of the town or city is included: *Gatwick Airport*, *Cambridge University Press*.

But there are some exceptions:

- *Have you been on **the** London Eye?*
- *They’ve been on **the** Eye at least ten times.*
- *We saw ‘Mamma Mia’ at **the** Bristol Hippodrome.* (the name of a theatre)
- *Have you been to **the** Hippodrome since they renovated it?*

### The sea, the coast, etc

When we are referring to general features of a country or its landscape, we use *the*: *the sea, the countryside, the city, the coast*.

### Places: fixed expressions

There are a lot of common fixed expressions relating to places. We don’t normally use *the* with these expressions. Here are some of them:

- *to town: I’m going **to town** this afternoon.*
- *in town: She works **in town**.*
- *at school/university: They met **at university**.*
- *from school/university: What time do they get home **from school**?*
- *in hospital: Linda’s been **in hospital** since Friday.*
- *in prison: Her husband is **in prison**, and life is very difficult for her.*
