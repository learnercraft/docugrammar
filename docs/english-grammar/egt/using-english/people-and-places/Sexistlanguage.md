# Sexist language

Sexist language is language which excludes one sex or the other, or which suggests that one sex is superior to the other. For example, traditionally, *he, him* and *his* were used to refer to both sexes, male and female, but nowadays many people feel that this makes *she, her* and *hers* seem less important or inferior. It is best to avoid sexist language in order not to offend people.

## He, she, him, her, his, hers

In writing, we can use *(s)he*, *he/she, him/her* or *his/her* to refer to both sexes at the same time. When speaking formally, we say *he or she* and *his or her*:

- *The teacher is the person who organises the class. **(S)he** is the one who controls timekeeping and the sequence of events.*
- Not: *~~She is the one~~ … or ~~He is the one~~* …
- *A police officer should remember that **he/she** is a public servant and should therefore always be polite. It is **his/her** duty to assist the public.*
- *University administrator: Could each candidate please leave **his or her** exam registration form at the office before midday, please?* (spoken)

We can use *they*, *them*, *their* and *theirs* to refer to both sexes at the same time, even when a singular noun has been used, although some people consider this unacceptable. However, in present-day English, this usage is becoming more accepted:

- ***Every student*** *must show **their** identity card on entering the examination room.* (preferred to *Every student must show his identity card*.)
- ***A nurse*** *has to be very open and understanding.* ***They must listen to their patients and respond to them.*** (preferred to *She must listen to her patients*. or *He must listen to his patients*.)

## Suffixes -man, -master -woman and -ess

Many people feel that traditional uses of the suffixes *\-man, -master, -woman* and *\-ess* are sexist and outdated, so alternative, neutral forms are often used (m = male; f = female).

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>traditional form</td><td>neutral alternative</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>fireman</i> (m)</td><td><i>fire-fighter</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>policeman</i> (m) <i>policewoman</i> (f)</td><td><i>police officer</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>headmaster</i> (m) <i>headmistress</i> (f)</td><td><i>headteacher</i> or <i>head</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>waiter</i> (m) <i>waitress</i> (f)</td><td><i>server</i> (American English)</td></tr></tbody></table>

In many cases, we can use the traditional male suffix for both sexes.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>traditional form</td><td>neutral alternative</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>actor</i> (m) <i>actress</i> (f)</td><td><i>actor</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>manager</i> (m) <i>manageress</i> (f)</td><td><i>manager</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>poet</i> (m) <i>poetess</i> (f)</td><td><i>poet</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>waiter</i> (m) <i>waitress</i> (f)</td><td><i>waiter</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Nouns, adjectives and verbs with man

Some nouns, adjectives and verbs which include *man* are considered sexist nowadays. We can often use neutral alternatives:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>traditional form</td><td>neutral alternatives</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>manpower</i> (noun)</td><td><i>workers, workforce, staff, personnel, human resources</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>man</i> (verb)</td><td><i>staff, be at, attend to</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>manmade</i> (adjective)</td><td><i>artificial, synthetic</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

*The firm is hoping to take on more **workers** (or* ***staff).*** (preferred to *… more manpower …*)

*Somebody will have to **be at** the entrance to take the tickets as people come in.* (preferred to *Somebody will have to man the entrance …*)

***Synthetic*** *fibres are never as nice to wear as natural ones.* (preferred to *Manmade fibres …*)
