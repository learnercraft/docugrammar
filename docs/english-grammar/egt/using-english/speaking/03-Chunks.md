# Chunks

When we speak and write, we repeat a lot of phrases and clauses, such as *on the other hand, a lot of, at the moment, you know, you see, I mean*. Some of these phrases, or chunks of language, are very common and they have specific meanings.

## Chunks in speaking

We use chunks like *you know, you know what I mean, I know what you’re saying* to check and show understanding between speaker and listener:

- \[company employees talking\]
- A: *You ask for a report and you end up with a hundred pages*. ***You know what I mean?***
- B: *Yeah*. ***I know what you’re saying***.

We use *you see* as a discourse marker when we are explaining something. It shows that what we are saying is new information for the listener:

- *But he’s trying to send us an email and I’m having some trouble with the computer, **you see**.*

We use chunks of vague language such as *and that kind of thing, and that sort of thing, and so on, and things like that, and stuff like that* to talk about collections of things without having to make a long list:

- *… when you start your final year and you come to ask for help on getting jobs **and that kind of thing**, you’ll be asked to fill in a form describing the work you did last summer …*

We use chunks like *having said that* and *saying that* to show that what we are going to say next is in contrast to what we have just said:

- *But, **having said that**, what her mother’s been doing is running her into school and picking her up …*

## Chunks in writing

We use many chunks in writing. They help us to structure what we write:

- *The most lethal weapon on earth is the human mind; but **on the other hand** it is only the mind that is capable of envisioning what is humanly desirable and what is not.*
- *Exports were slightly higher than imports, and **as a result**, there was a positive trade balance.*
- ***First of all****, working procedures could be standardised, so that orders can be clearly performed.*
- *… he identifies and examines the various ways in which a wide variety of ‘change agents’ – industrial workers, social workers, church ministers, politicians, protest leaders, business and professional people, housewives, youth and community institutions **and so forth –** made such progress possible.*

## Chunks as frames

Some chunks don’t look complete (*I don’t know if, in the middle of*). These usually help make up or frame sentences:

### I don’t know if …

We often use *I don’t know if* … as a frame for questions that start conversations:

- ***I don’t know if*** *you’ve ever been to Canberra.*
- ***I don’t know if*** *you saw that film on TV last night.*

### You know the …

We use *you know the* … when we are telling stories or introducing a person, place or thing which the listener already knows about:

- A: ***You know the*** *guy who used to call around selling lottery tickets?*
- B: *Yeah. I remember him*.
- A: *Well I saw him the other day, wearing a pinstriped suit*.
- ***You know the*** *shop on the corner, that’s the one that got broken into.*
