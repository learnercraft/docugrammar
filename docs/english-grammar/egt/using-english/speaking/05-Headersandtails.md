# Headers and tails

Headers and tails are common in speaking, but very uncommon in writing. We use headers when we place information at the front of what we say. This can help our listeners to understand more easily what we are referring to. Headers can consist of a noun phrase or noun phrases or whole clauses. The header is followed by a pronoun (underlined in the examples) which refers back to the header:

- ***Anna, David’s sister****,* she*’s going to New York for her birthday.*
- ***That big house****, is* it *where the doctor lives?*
- ***Going to football matches****,* that*’s what my cousin Jim likes best.*

Tails occur at the end of what we say. They are commonly noun phrases. Tails refer back to a pronoun (underlined in the examples), and commonly give more information about it. Like headers, they help a listener to understand more easily what we are referring to:

- They*’re not cheap to buy, **cars in Singapore**.*
- She*’s a really good marathon runner, **Alice**.*
