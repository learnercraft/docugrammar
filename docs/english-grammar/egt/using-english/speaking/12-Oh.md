## Oh as an interjection

We use *oh* as an interjection to express surprise or disappointment:

- A: *We’re almost out of petrol*.

- A: *Amanda is very good on the violin. She used to play in an orchestra*.
- B: ***Oh****! I never knew that*.
- A: *It’s going to cost quite a lot of money to fix the car*.
- B: ***Oh***. *What’s wrong with it?*

## Oh as a discourse marker

We use *oh* as a discourse marker to respond to new information or to show that we have just discovered something surprising. We often use it with other discourse markers:

- *I can’t find the switch. **Oh right**, here it is.*
- A: *I need to talk to you urgently*.
- B: ***Oh okay***. *Do sit down*.

### Oh, that’s …

We often use *oh* in responses with statements beginning with *that’s*:

- A: *Some great news. I got the job in Manchester*.
- B: ***Oh, that’s wonderful***. *Congratulations*.

### Oh yes and oh no

We often make *oh* more positive by adding *yes*, and more negative by adding *no*:

- B: ***Oh right***. *Well, I did see his car in the car park*.

### Oh yeah

- A: *So then she decided to tell him what had happened*.

↗

- B: ***Oh yeah***.
- A: *He wasn’t very pleased and then …*

### Oh well
