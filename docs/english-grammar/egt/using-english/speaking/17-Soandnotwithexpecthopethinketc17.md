# So and not with expect, hope, think, etc

We can use *so* after some verbs instead of repeating an object clause, especially in short answers. The verbs we do this with most are: *appear, assume, be afraid* (meaning ‘regret’), *believe, expect, guess, hope, imagine, presume, reckon, seem, suppose, think*:

- *Chris thinks the tickets are too expensive, and Madeline **thinks so** too.*
- (… and Madeline thinks the tickets are expensive.)
- A: *Are you working on Saturday?*
- B: *I****’m*** ***afraid*** ***so***. *I wish I wasn’t!* (I’m afraid I’m working.)
- A: *D’you think the weather’s going to be fine tomorrow?*
- B: *I* ***hope so***. *I want to do some work in the garden*. (I hope the weather’s going to be fine.)

We can use *not* after *be afraid, guess, hope* and *suppose* instead of using a negative object clause:

- A: *Can we speak to Mr Brindley, please?*
- B: *I****’m*** ***afraid*** ***not***. *He’s busy*. (I’m afraid you cannot speak to Mr Brindley.)
- A: *It looks as if Louis won’t be coming with us after all*.
- B: *I* ***guess not***. *It’s a pity*.
- *She thinks she might lose her job in the New Year, but she **hopes not**.*

With *believe, expect* and *think*, we normally use auxiliary *do* *\+ not* + main verb + *so*:

- A: *Did Frances come here this morning?*
- B: *I* ***don’t believe so***. *Ask Hannah*.
- *They asked Wilma if she thought her mother would refuse the invitation. She said she **didn’t think so**.*

We can find *believe not, expect not* and *think not* in classic literature and in very formal situations, but it is not common in everyday modern English:

- \[from the novel *Dombey and Son* (1848) by Charles Dickens\]
- *‘He is in England, I hope, aunt?’ said the child.*
- *‘I believe so. Yes; I know he is, indeed.’*
- *‘Has he ever been here?’*
- *‘I **believe not**. No.’*
- *Are we prepared to change our entire lives for the sake of one person? I **think not**.*

## Typical errors

We don’t use *so* + object clause together:

- A: *Is George coming today?*
- B: *I don’t think* ***so***.
- Not: *~~I don’t think so he’s coming today.~~*

We don’t say *I think* or *I don’t think* without *so* in short answers:

- A: *Is next Monday a public holiday?*
- B: *Yes*, ***I think so***.
- Not: *~~Yes, I think.~~*
