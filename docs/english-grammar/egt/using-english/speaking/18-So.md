# So

## So \+ adjective (so difficult), so \+ adverb (so slowly)

We often use *so* when we mean ‘to such a great extent’. With this meaning, *so* is a degree adverb that modifies adjectives and other adverbs:

- *Using that camera is easy. Why is she making it **so** difficult?*
- *Why is she **so** untidy?*
- *I’m sorry I’m walking **so** slowly. I’ve hurt my ankle.*
- *It doesn’t always work out **so** well.*

We also use *so* as an intensifier to mean ‘very, very’:

- *That motorway is **so** dangerous. Everyone drives too fast.*
- *That’s kind of you. Thanks **so** much for thinking of us.*

We often use *so* with *that*:

- *He’s **so** lazy **that** he never helps out with the housework.*
- *It was **so** dark (**that**) we could hardly see.*

We don’t use *so* before an adjective + a noun (attributive adjective). We use s*uch*:

- *She emailed us **such** lovely pictures of her and Enzo.*
- Not: … ~~so lovely pictures~~ …

We use ***such*** not *so* to modify noun phrases:

- *She is **such** a hard-working colleague.*
- Not: … ~~so a hard-working colleague~~.
- *It’s taken them **such** a long time to send the travel brochures.*
- Not: … ~~so a long time~~ …

- *Such*

## So much and so many

We use *so* before *much*, *many*, *little* and *few*:

- *There were **so many** people on the beach it was difficult to get into the sea.*
- *There are **so few** people who know what it is like in our country for other people from different cultures.*
- *You’ve eaten **so little** and I’ve eaten* ***so much!***

:::

We use *so much*, not *so*, before comparatives:

- *I feel **so*** ***much** better after I’ve been for a run in the park.*
- Not: *~~I feel so better~~* …
- *My house is **so much** colder than yours.*

## So as a substitute form

### So substituting for an adjective

In formal contexts we can use *so* instead of an adjective phrase after a verb:

- *The bus service was very unreliable when I was young and it remains **so** even today.* (It remains very unreliable …)
- *She is very anxious. She’s been **so** since the accident.* (She’s been very anxious since the accident.)

### More so, less so

When we are comparing, we use *more so* and *less so* as substitutes:

- *The kitchen is very old-fashioned, the living room **more so**.* (The living room is more old-fashioned than the kitchen.)
- *My old office was very dark; my new office **less so**.* (My new office is less dark than my old office.)

### So as substitute

With some verbs, we often use *so* instead of repeating an object clause, especially in short answers:

- A: *Will Megan be at the meeting today?*
- B: *I think* ***so***. (I think Megan will be at the meeting today.)
- *The next train is going to be half an hour late. They told me* ***so when I bought my ticket.*** (They told me (that) the next train is going to be half an hour late.)

- *So* and *not* with *expect*, *hope*, *think*, etc.

### So with reporting verbs

Spoken English:

Especially in speaking, we sometimes use *so* in front position in short responses with reporting verbs such as *believe*, *say, tell, hear, read*:

- *She’s the most popular singer. **So** everybody says, anyway.*
- A: *Janet got the job*.
- B: ***So*** *I heard*. (I heard that Janet got the job.)
- A: *The Council has given planning permission for another shopping centre in the city*.
- B: ***So*** *I read in the paper*. (I read that the Council has given planning permission for another shopping centre.)

## So am I, so do I, Neither do I

We use *so* with *be* and with modal and auxiliary verbs to mean ‘in the same way’, ‘as well’ or ‘too’. We use it in order to avoid repeating a verb, especially in short responses with pronoun subjects. When we use *so* in this way, we invert the verb and subject, and we do not repeat the main verb (*so* + verb \[= v\] + subject \[= s\]):

- *Geoff is a very good long-distance runner and **so** \[V\] is \[S\] his wife.*
- A: *What are you doing tonight?*
- B: *I’ve got loads of exam marking to do and I’m staying at home*.
- A: ***So*** \[V\] *am* \[S\] *I*.
- *They all joined the new gym and after three weeks **so** \[V\] did \[S\] he.* (… and after three weeks he joined the gym too.)

### Neither do I

We also use *not* … *either*, *nor* or *neither* when we want to give a negative meaning:

- A: *I don’t think she’ll be coming to the party*.
- B: ***Nor****/**Neither** do I*. (or *I don’t either*.)

:::note[See also]

- *Neither, neither … nor* and *not … either*

:::

### So in exclamations

Spoken English:

When we make exclamative responses, we can use *so* as a substitute before the subject and verb *be*, or subject and modal or auxiliary verb:

- A: *We’re out of salt*.
- B: *Oh*, ***so*** ***we are****!*
- A: *Look Mum, I can climb all the way to the top*.
- B: ***So*** ***you can!***

## So as a conjunction

We use *so* as a subordinating conjunction to introduce clauses of result or decision:

- *I got here late. It was a long journey, **so** I’m really tired now.*
- *You are right, of course, **so** I think we will accept what the bank offers.*
- *It’s much cheaper with that airline, isn’t it, **so** I’ll get all the tickets for us with them.*

### So and that\-clauses

We use *so* + *that* as a conjunction to introduce clauses of reason and explanation:

- *They both went on a diet **so that** they could play more football with their friends.*

We also use *so +* adjective or adverb before *that*\-clauses. We do not use *very* in this structure:

- *It was **so*** ***hot that** we didn’t leave the air-conditioned room all day.*
- *They drove **so*** ***fast that** they escaped the police car that was chasing them.*
- Not: *~~They drove very fast that~~* …

:::note[See also]

- *So that* or *in order that*?

:::

## So as a discourse marker

Spoken English:

*So* is a very common discourse marker in speaking. It usually occurs at the beginning of clauses and we use it when we are summarising what has just been said, or when we are changing topic:

- \[from a lecture on English literature\]
- ***So****, we’ve covered the nineteenth century and we’re now going to look at all the experiments in the novel in the early twentieth century.*
- \[discussing whether to eat a pudding or keep it till the following morning\]
- A: *I’m not having it cold in the morning*.
- B: *Oh*. ***So*** *what sort of pudding is it?*
- ***So****, what time does the film start?*

## So: other uses in speaking

*So far* means ‘up to now’:

- ***So far*** *we have kept the news within the family.*

We use the expression *is that so*? in responses to express surprise or suspicion:

- A: *When I came to the flat all the lights were still on!*
- B: *Oh*, ***is that so?***
- A: *Yes*!

Spoken English:

We sometimes use *so* in informal speaking to indicate the size or extent of something. We use it in a similar way to *this* and we usually use hand gestures to show the size or extent:

- \[referring to a valuable diamond in a ring\]
- *It’s about **so** small.* (or *It’s about **this** small*.)

We also sometimes use *so* to mean ‘like this’:

- *Hold the racket in your left hand – **so**. That’s right.*

In speaking, we also use *so* to intensify words, phrases and clauses. We stress *so* quite strongly. This usage is very common among some younger speakers. It has a meaning similar to *just* or *just like*:

- *I’m **so** not interested.*
- *That’s **so** Jack. He always behaves like that.* (That’s just like Jack.)
- *That is **so** what I don’t want to hear!*
