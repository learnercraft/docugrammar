# Here and there

*Here* and *there* are adverbs.

## Here and there: meanings

When we use *here*, it typically refers to the place where the speaker is, and we see the position of people and things from the speaker’s point of view:

- *Do you want to stay **here** or go to another restaurant?*
- *Could you come **here** and help me for a minute?*

When we use *there*, it typically refers to the place where the listener or another person is, and we see the position of people and things from the listener’s or another person’s point of view:

- *Our son Jim’s living in Barcelona. He wants us to go **there** for a holiday.*
- A: *Where’s my cup of tea?*
- B: *It’s* ***there***, *next to you, on the little table!*

## Here and there with this, that, these, those (demonstratives)

We often use *here* with nouns that have *this* or *these* before them, and *there* with nouns that have *that* or *those* before them:

- *Are **these** shoes **here** yours?*
- *You press **that** button **there** and the motor should start.*

### Here and there with bring and take

We often use *here* with *bring* and *there* with *take*:

- ***Bring*** *your glass **here** and I’ll give you some juice.*
- *This package has to go to the post room. Would you **take** it **there** for me, please?*

## Here and there after prepositions

We can use *here* and *there* after prepositions:

- *Is there a bank **around here**?*
- *It’s cold **in here**. Shut that door!*
- A: *Where shall I put this box of books?*
- B: *Oh, put it* ***over there***, *please, by the bookshelf*.

## Here and there in front position

We can use *here* and *there* in front position, with the subject and verb inverted. The most common expressions of this type are *here is x*, *here comes x*, *there is x, there goes x*:

- A: ***Here’s the CD*** *I said I’d lend you, the Brazilian music*.
- B: *Oh, thanks*.
- ***Here comes your taxi****, so we’d better say bye bye now.*
- \[pointing to a shop across the street\]
- ***There’s the shop*** *where I bought those black shoes you liked.*
- *Oh look, **there goes** Freda on a bike. I didn’t know she had one!*

When the subject is a pronoun, we do not invert the subject and verb:

- A: *Where’s the tin opener?*
- B: ***There it is***, *on the sink*.
- Not: *~~There is it, on the sink.~~*

## Here you are, there you are

We can use *here you are* and *there you are* (or, in informal situations, *here you go* and *there you go*) when giving something to someone. *Here* and *there* have the same meaning in this use:

- A: *Did you get my newspaper?*
- B: *Yes*. ***Here you are***. \[gives it to A\]
- A: *Can you pass me that dictionary?*
- B: ***There you go***. \[gives A the dictionary\]
- A: *Thank you*.

## Here it is! There he is

We often use *here* + subject pronoun *\+ be* and *there* + subject pronoun + *be* at the moment of finding or meeting someone or something we have been looking for or waiting for:

- A: *Has anyone seen my pen?*
- B: ***Here it is***, *right by the phone*.
- *Simon! **There you are!** Everyone’s waiting for you!*

## Here I am

People often say that they have arrived or that someone else has arrived using *here* + subject pronoun + *be*:

- A: *Hello! **Here we are**! I hope we haven’t missed lunch?*
- B: *Hello. No, you’re right on time*.

## Here: on the telephone

People often use *here* to identify themselves on the telephone or in voicemail messages:

- A: *Hi, Rex*, ***Julia here***. *How are you?*
- B: *Julia, hi. Fine, thanks. And you?*

## Hello there

We often use *there* in informal situations after *hello* and *hi*:

- A: ***Hello there***. *How’s things?*
- B: ***Hi there***. *Fine. How are you?* (*How’s things?* is something that we say in informal contexts but we don’t write it. *How are things?* is less informal.)
