# Questions: short forms

In informal situations, especially in speaking, we can reduce questions rather than using complete clauses. Short questions can be clauses, phrases or even single words:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>Full form</td><td>Short form</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Are you hungry?</i></td><td><i>You hungry? or Hungry?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Is this your pen?</i></td><td><i>This your pen?</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

When we shorten questions, the auxiliary verb and the subject are both often omitted (ellipsis):

- A: *Got the key?* (full form: *Have you got the key?*)
- B: *Yeah*.
- A: *Working tonight?* (full form: *Are you working tonight?*)
- B: *No, thankfully*.

:::warning

We cannot omit the auxiliary verb or the subject if the subject is *I*:

- *Have I met you before?*
- Not: *~~Met you before?~~*
- *Am I really the one for this job?*
- Not: *~~I really the one for this job?~~*

:::

When we know a lot about the context, we often shorten questions:

- A: *Are you looking forward to the party?* (full form)
- B: *Not really*.
- A: *Why aren’t you?* (full form: *Why aren’t you looking forward to the party?*)
- B: *I’m not a great fan of parties*.

When we know a lot about the context, it would be unusual and often too formal to use the full form of the question.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>A: <i>Want to go for lunch now?</i>B: <i>Yeah, great</i>.A: <i>The Diner?</i>B: <i>That’s perfect</i>.</td><td>A and B know each other well and they often go to lunch at The Diner.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>A: <i>Do you want to go for lunch now?</i>B: <i>Yeah, great</i>.A: <i>Do you want to go to The Diner?</i>B: <i>That’s perfect</i>.</td><td>The full forms of the questions are correct but the full form of the second question sounds more formal than the short form.</td></tr></tbody></table>
