# Substitution

## Substitution: purpose

In speaking and in writing, we try to avoid repeating words, phrases or clauses. We use substitute forms to do this:

- A: *Pam always brings us back chocolates when she travels*.
- B: *Oh, nice*.
- A: *She brought some Belgian **ones** from her last trip, which were delicious*.
- B: *Lucky you!*
- (A uses *ones* to avoid repeating *chocolates*.)

- \[A has a problem with her computer\]
- A: *Do you think I should phone Barry and ask him to come and look at it*.
- B: *Yes*, ***do***. (B uses *do* to avoid repeating *phone Barry and ask him to come and look at it*.)

We can use substitution to refer backwards or forwards. Forward substitution is far less common than backward substitution (The noun being referred to is underlined in the examples.):

- *If you need **them**, there are* nails *in the toolbox* (forward substitution).
- A large saucepan *is what we need for making jam, but I don’t have* ***one*** (backward substitution).

## Substitution: what forms can we use?

We can use many different words and phrases in substitution, including words such as *both, either, some* (indefinite quantifying pronouns), *do* and *so*, and expressions such as *the same* and *thus*.

### Indefinite quantifying pronouns

The following words and phrases are commonly used as substitutes:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>(a) little</i></td><td><i>each</i></td><td><i>less</i></td><td><i>one(s</i>)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>another</i></td><td><i>either</i></td><td><i>many</i></td><td><i>other(s</i>)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>all</i></td><td><i>enough</i></td><td><i>much</i></td><td><i>several</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>any</i></td><td><i>few</i></td><td><i>neither</i></td><td><i>some</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>both</i></td><td><i>half</i></td><td><i>none</i></td><td><br/></td></tr></tbody></table>

A: *There’s this card with a clown on it and this one with a monkey. Which do you think Mark would prefer?*

B: *I think he’d like* ***either***.

A: *Does she have a lot of friends at work?*

B: *No, not* ***one***.

### Substituting with do

We use *do, do so, do it, do the same* to substitute for a verb and whatever accompanies it (complement):

- A: *We always have toast and coffee in the morning*.
- B: *We **do** too. I can’t function without breakfast*. (*Do* substitutes for *have toast and coffee in the morning*.)

- *Do* as a substitute verb

### Substituting with so

We can use *so* as a substitute in a number of ways: for an adjective (*it remains so*), an object clause (*I think so*), with reporting verbs (*so I heard*) and in exclamations (*so he is!*).

- *So* as a substitute form
- *So am I*, *so do I*, *Neither do I*

## Substitution for nouns

### One, some, ones

We mostly use *one* and *some/ones* to substitute for countable nouns:

- *She tried to get a ticket but she couldn’t get **one**.* (She couldn’t get a ticket.)
- A: *Is there a bookshop around here?*
- B: *There are two second-hand **ones** at the end of the street on the right*.

Where there is nothing before or after *ones*, *some* or *any* are used as a plural substitute:

- A: *Have either of you got any one pound coins for this machine?*
- B: *Let me see, I’ve definitely got* ***some***.
- C: *I’m afraid I don’t have* ***any***.
- Not: *~~Let me see, I’ve definitely got ones.~~*
- Not: *~~I’m afraid I don’t have ones.~~*

- *Any*
- *One*
- *Some*
- *Some* and *any*

### Indefinite quantifying pronouns (little, all, both, neither)

We can use indefinite quantifying pronouns such as *(a) little, all, both, many, much, neither, few* to substitute for noun phrases:

- *Hundreds of people went to the village festival and **all** seemed to enjoy themselves very much.*

### That, those

We can use *that* and *those* as substitutes meaning ‘the one(s)’ in more formal contexts:

- *The water for the factory was **that** from the local reservoir.*
- *The books he read were **those** which he found in the old library.*

In formal contexts, especially in academic style, we use *that of/those of*:

- *The head has a similar shape and size to **that of** a mammal.*

- *This*, *that*, *these*, *those*
