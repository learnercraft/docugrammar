# Yes

*Yes* is the opposite of *no*. We usually use *yes* to show that we agree with something, accept something or are willing to do something:

- A: *Shall we stop for a coffee soon?*
- B: ***Yes***. *That’s a good idea*.
- A: *Do you eat fish, Lisa?*
- B: ***Yes***, *absolutely*.
- A: *Tim, can you work on the Rossiter Project with Will?*
- B: ***Yes***. *Sure*.

We can use *yes* as a response token to show that we are listening to someone and that we agree, or simply that we want them to continue talking. In informal speaking, we often use *yeah* instead of *yes*, especially to show that we are listening:

- A: *I just added some garlic and chillies to the olive oil*.
- B: ***Yes***.
- A: *Then I added just a little lemon juice*.
- B: ***Yeah***. *Right*.
- A: *And some salt and pepper and that was it.*
- B: *Really. It sounds so easy. I must try it sometime*.

We use *yes* to answer negative questions and negative question tags:

- A: *Didn’t we visit Ellis Island when we went to New York?*
- B: ***Yes***, *we did*.
- A: *Haven’t you got two sisters?*
- B: ***Yes***. *That’s right*.
- Not: *~~No, that’s right.~~*
- A: *That’s Stuart over there, isn’t it?*
- B: ***Yes***, *it is. He’s got his brother with him too*.
