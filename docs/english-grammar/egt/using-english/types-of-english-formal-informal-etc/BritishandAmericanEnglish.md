# British and American English

Most of the differences between the English of the UK (which we shall call BrE) and the English of North America (which we shall call AmE) are vocabulary differences and differences in pronunciation and spelling.

However, there are some differences in the way grammar is used. Almost all of the structures in this book are used in both varieties, but there are often differences in how common a structure is in one variety or the other. There are fewer differences in writing than in speaking.

Grammar is always changing, and many new ways of using grammar in BrE come from AmE, because of the influence of American popular culture, American media and the Internet.

## British and American English: verbs

### Be going to

Spoken English:

AmE speakers often use *be going to* (and the informal short form *gonna*) when giving street directions, which is not a typical use in BrE. BrE speakers normally use imperatives (with and without *you*), and present simple or future forms with *will*:

- \[AmE\] *You**’re gonna**go three blocks and then you**’re gonna** see an apartment building on the left with 1228 above the door.*
- \[BrE\]
- A: ***Take*** *this street here on the right, then **go** about two hundred yards till you come to a set of traffic lights*.
- B: *Okay*.
- A: ***You turn*** *left at the lights*, ***go*** *about another hundred yards and you**’ll** see the station*.
- B: *Great. Thanks very much*.

### Burn, learn, dream, etc

In BrE, we can spell the past simple and *\-ed* participle of verbs such as *burn, dream, lean, learn, smell, spell, spill* with either -*ed* (*learned, spilled*) or *\-t* (*learnt, spilt*). AmE prefers the -*ed* ending:

- \[BrE\] *She had **dreamt** of being a dancer when she was young.* (or *She had dreamed …*)
- \[AmE\] *As a boy, he had **dreamed** about being on the basketball team.*
- \[BrE\] *He **learnt** to speak fluent Spanish and Portuguese.* (or *He learned …*)
- \[AmE\] *She **learned** to play the violin.*

### Fit

In BrE, the past simple form of *fit* is usually *fitted*. In AmE, the past simple form of *fit* is most often *fit*:

- \[BrE\] *The sweater **fitted** her perfectly.*
- \[a woman is remembering her poor childhood, AmE\]
- *But we always looked nice. You know. We were always very clean. The clothes were clean and they **fit**.*

### Get

In BrE, the three forms of *get* are *get* (base form), *got* (past simple) and *got* (*\-ed* form). In AmE, *get* has an -*ed* form *gotten*:

- \[AmE\] *The weather has **gotten** colder this week and we’re expecting snow.*

*Get* + *to*\-infinitive is common in AmE to refer to achievements, meaning ‘manage to’ or ‘be able to’. This usage is less common in BrE:

- \[talking about American football, AmE\]
- A: *Did you **get to go** to very many games?*
- B: *I went to four games this year, actually*.
- \[talking about a camping trip in the forest, AmE\]
- *We **got to see** a lot of deer.*

### Have and have got

The present simple form of *have got* referring to possession or relationships is much more common in spoken BrE than in AmE. AmE speakers often prefer to use the verb *have* on its own:

- \[BrE\] *I**’ve got** a picture of you when you were a teenager. D’you want to see it?*
- \[AmE\] *I **have** two cousins in Ohio.*

- *Have got* and *have*

### Have got to and have to

*Have got to* is much more common in BrE than AmE. *Have to* (without *got*) is more common in AmE than in BrE:

- \[BrE\] *We**’ve got to** take my mother back to the hospital a week on Friday.*
- \[AmE\] *We **have to** be back in San Francisco next Sunday to fly home again.*

:::note[See also]

- *Have got to* and *have to*

:::

### Shall

BrE speakers often use *shall* with *I* and *we* in statements when referring to the future, especially in more formal situations. AmE prefers *will*:

- \[BrE\]
- *I **shall** be back in a minute.* (formal)
- *We **shall** be talking about this in detail tomorrow.*
- \[AmE\]
- *I****’ll call you early tomorrow morning.***
- *We **will** see what happens after the new company takes us over.*

- *Shall*
- *Will*

### Substitute verb do

BrE speakers often add the substitute verb *do* to short clauses with modal verbs, especially in short answers. AmE speakers prefer to use the modal verb on its own:

- \[a group of students talk about the grades they might get in an exam, BrE\]
- A: *I don’t reckon I’ll get all as this time*.
- B: *No*.
- A: *I might* ***do***, *but I doubt it*.
- \[AmE\]
- A: *Yeah, so you think you might get an exercise bicycle?*
- B: *Oh, I* ***might***. *I have a regular bicycle out in the garage, but it’s been kind of raining and stuff around here lately*.

- \[A is asking B about his past, BrE\]

## Adjectives and adverbs

### Really, real

In informal spoken AmE, speakers often use *real* instead of *really* before an adjective. This is considered non-standard by many AmE speakers:

- \[AmE\] *That’s **real** funny!* (BrE preferred form *really funny*)
- \[AmE\] *I thought it was a **real** good movie.* (BrE preferred form *really good film*)

### Well and good

AmE speakers often use *good* where BrE prefers *well*. However, the AmE form is becoming more common in BrE, especially after greetings such as *How are you?, How’s it going?*:

- \[AmE\]
- A: *How are you?*
- B: *I’m* ***good***. (BrE preferred form *I’m well* or *I’m fine*)
- *It all worked out **real good**.* (BrE preferred form *really well*)

### Likely

AmE allows the use of *likely* as an adjective (in the same way as *probable, possible*, etc.), or as an adverb (in the same way as *probably, possibly*, etc.). In BrE, *likely* is normally only used as an adjective:

- \[AmE\] *There **will likely be** other announcements before the end of this year.* (*likely* as an adverb; BrE preferred form *There are likely to be*)
- \[AmE\] *The focus on the economy **will likely continue** when the new President takes office.* (BrE preferred form *is likely to continue*)
- \[AmE\] *And what**’s likely** to happen?* (*likely* as an adjective, also common in BrE)

## Tags

Question tags are much more common in BrE than in AmE, but a wide range of question tags are used in both varieties:

- \[BrE\] *She’s Swedish, **isn’t she**?*
- \[AmE\] *Elvis wasn’t your favourite rock star, **was he**?*

In informal situations, AmE speakers often use a tag with rising intonation in responses which show surprise or emotional involvement. The tag has the same form as the statement the speaker is responding to (affirmative statement → affirmative tag; negative statement → negative tag). This is not common in BrE:

- \[AmE\]
- A: *I took the Chinese course last semester*.
- B: *Oh*, ***you di***↗***d****?* (BrE preferred form *Oh, did you?* with fall-rise or rising intonation)
- A: *Yeah*.
- \[AmE\]
- A: *My sister still lives with my mom*.
- B: ***She does****?* (BrE preferred form *Does she?*)
- A: *Uh-huh*.

Tags at the end of affirmative statements which have an affirmative form occur in both varieties but are quite rare in AmE:

- \[BrE\] *He works really hard, **he does**.*
- \[AmE\] *And so when she went to a nursing home, in the beginning, I think she kind of liked it. She did art work there, **she did**, yeah.*

Both varieties use the tag *right*, but it is more common in AmE:

- A: *She’s studying geography*, ***right****?*
- B: *Yeah, geography*.
