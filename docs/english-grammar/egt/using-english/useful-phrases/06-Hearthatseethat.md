# Hear that, see that

We use *hear that* and *see that* to introduce new pieces of information. When we do this, the verbs *hear* and *see* mean ‘understand’ or ‘notice’. We normally use *hear* when we are thinking of something someone told us, and *see* when we are thinking about something we read about or saw. We often use the verbs in the present simple and sometimes leave out *that*:

- ***I hear*** *Kevin’s getting married in June.*
- *I **see** the Indian cricket team won again.*

We use verbs such as *understand*, *learn* and *gather* in a similar way:

- *We **gather** that this is the key for the flat.*
- *I saw them yesterday and they **understand** he has resigned.*
