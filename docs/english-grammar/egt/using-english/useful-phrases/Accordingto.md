# According to

*According to* means ‘as reported by’ or ‘as stated by’ and refers to an opinion which is not the speaker’s opinion. *According to* usually occurs in front position. It is commonly followed by a noun phrase and sometimes by a clause:

- ***According to*** *Jeff, the film starts at 7.30.*
- ***According to*** *the instructions, you’ll need to buy some glue.*
- *The government, **according to** a poll taken last month, may lose the next election.*

We often use *according to* in formal contexts to refer to official evidence such as statistics or reports:

- ***According to*** *a recent report by the Department of Health, most people still do not take enough exercise.*

*According to* also means ‘depending on’ or ‘in agreement with’:

- *They take a test and are then put in to groups **according to** their ability.*
- *The rents are high but they vary **according to** whether you want a garden.*

## Typical error

We only use *according to* when we refer to an opinion from someone else or somewhere else. When we talk about our opinion, we use phrases such as ‘in my opinion’ or ‘in our view’:

- ***In my opinion****, they were not very polite.*
- Not: *~~According to me~~* …
