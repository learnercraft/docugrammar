# Actual and actually

## Actual

*Actual* is an adjective meaning ‘true’, ‘real’ and ‘the thing in itself’. It does not refer to time. *Actual* always comes immediately before the noun it is describing:

- *We didn’t go to the **actual** match but we watched it on TV.*
- *People think she is over thirty but her **actual** age is eighteen.*

Spoken English:

*Actual* is often used in speaking in the expression ‘in actual fact’. It has a similar meaning to ‘in fact’, but it gives more emphasis to what the speaker is saying:

- ***In actual fact****, her health a year ago was much worse.*

- *In fact*

## Actually as a discourse marker

Spoken English:

*Actually* is often used in speaking as a discourse marker. We use it to indicate a new topic of conversation or a change or contrast in what is being talked about. We also use *actually* to give more detail about a topic. We do not use it to refer to time:

- A: *I suppose you’re going away this weekend?*
- B: ***Actually***, *I am going to stay at home. I’ve got a lot of work to do on the computer*.
- \[a customer (A) in a large bookshop is asking about books about travel.\]
- A: *Could you tell me where your books on Austria are kept?*
- B: *What kind of books?*
- A: *Well*, ***actually*** *I’m looking for a book on skiing in Austria*.
- B: *Er, yes, they’re in that corner over there*.

## Actually as contrast

Spoken English:

We can use *actually* to emphasise a contrast with what is expected to be true or real:

- *He **actually** admitted that he enjoyed it.* (He was not expected to enjoy it)
- A: *Where are they now?*
- B: *They’re very near to your apartment* ***actually***. (They were not expected to be so near)

We can also use *actually* to correct someone politely:

- *I think ten people, not eight, came to the meeting, **actually**.*

## Actual and actually: typical errors

In some languages *actual* has the meaning of ‘current’ and ‘at the present time’. This is not correct in English:

- *The* ***current population of the Russian Federation is 230 million.***
- Not: *~~The actual population of the Russian Federation~~* …
- ***At the present time*** *she is working in London.*
- Not: *~~Actually she is working in London.~~*
