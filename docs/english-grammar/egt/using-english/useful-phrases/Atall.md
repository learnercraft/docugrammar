# At all

*At all* means ‘in any way’. We use it with questions and negatives to add emphasis, but not with affirmative statements:

- *Do you want to swim in the sea **at all**?*
- *She was not **at all** frightened.*

We can use *at all* before or after an adjective:

- *Were you **at all** upset by Kevin’s behaviour?*
- *They weren’t interested **at all**.*

## At all and politeness

We often use *at all* at the end of a question to make the question sound more polite:

- \[*ID* is an abbreviation of ‘identification’\]
- *Do you have any ID **at all**?*
- \[a waiter in a restaurant\]
- *Would you like any desserts **at all**?*

We can use *not at all* as a polite response to questions asking *Would you mind …?* or *Do you mind …?* and as a polite follow-up response to *thank you*:

- A: *Would you mind taking this parcel to the main office?*
- B: *No*, ***not at all***.
- A: *Do you mind if I sit here?*
- B: ***Not at all***.
- A: *That’s very kind of you, thank you*.
- B: ***Not at all***.
