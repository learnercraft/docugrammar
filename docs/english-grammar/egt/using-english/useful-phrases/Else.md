# Else

## Else with someone, anybody, nobody, etc

We use *else* after words beginning with *any-, every-, no-* and *some-*, to mean ‘other’, ‘another’, ‘different’ or ‘additional’.

This group of words includes:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>anybody</i></td><td><i>everybody</i></td><td><i>nobody</i></td><td><i>somebody</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>anyone</i></td><td><i>everyone</i></td><td><i>no one</i></td><td><i>somewhere</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>anywhere</i></td><td><i>everywhere</i></td><td><i>nowhere</i></td><td><i>someone</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

\[in a shop; A is the shop assistant, B is the customer\]

A: *Will there be* ***anything else***, *sir?* (Do you want any additional thing(s)?)

B: *No thanks, that’s it for now*.

*I was the only one who knew any German. **No one else** had ever done it at school.* (No other person had ever learnt it.)

\[outside a restaurant\]

*It looks really busy in there. Let’s go **somewhere else**.* (Let’s go to a different place.)

*This must be **someone else’s** coat. It’s not mine.*

## Else with who, what, where, etc

We use *else* after *how, what, where*, *who* and *why* to mean ‘other’, ‘another’, ‘different’ or ‘additional’:

- ***What else*** *do you need apart from new shoes?* (What other things do you need apart from new shoes?)
- *We’ve invited Jean and Richard. **Who else** should we invite?* (What other person or people should we invite?)
- ***Where else*** *have you worked, apart from the airport?* (What other place(s) have you worked at?)

We don’t use *else* after *which*:

- ***Which other one*** *do you want apart from this blue shirt?*
- Not: *~~Which else do you want~~* …?

## Else: or else

We use *or else* to say what the result will be if something does not happen:

- *I’ll have to leave now, **or else** I’ll miss my train.* (If I don’t leave now, I’ll miss my train.)
