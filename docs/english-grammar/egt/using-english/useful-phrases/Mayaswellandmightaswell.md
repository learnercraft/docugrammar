# May as well and might as well

We can use *may as well* and *might as well* for making suggestions. We can use them to say what we think is the easiest or most logical course of action when we cannot see a better alternative. They are both fairly informal. *Might as well* is more common than *may as well*:

- *You **might as well** get a taxi from the station. It’ll be quicker than me coming in to get you.*
- A: *What time does the film finish?*
- B: *I think it’s ten o’clock*.
- A: *Uh-huh*. ***We may as well*** *eat in town before it, then*.

We can make *may as well* and *might as well* stronger by using *just* after *may* or *might*:

- *Well, I think if it’s a choice between a job and a place at college, you **may just as well** take the job. At least you’ll earn some money.*
- *We don’t know anyone here and they’re discussing stuff that doesn’t concern us. **We might just as well** leave.*

:::warning

*May as well* and *might as well* don’t mean the same as *may also* and *might also*, in the sense of ‘possibly in addition’:

- *Before you go hiking, buy yourself a good pair of boots. You **may also** need to buy thick walking socks.* (in addition to boots, you might need to buy socks)
- Not: *~~You may as well buy~~* …
