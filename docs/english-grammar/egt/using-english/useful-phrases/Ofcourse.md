# Of course

We use *of course* to refer to things that are obvious or already known to the speaker and listener, or to everybody:

- *A tropical climate is, **of course**, very humid, so we sweated all the time.* (We use commas here, before and after *of course*, to show that it refers to the whole of the first clause.)
- A: *It’s a public holiday – that’s why the shops are closed*.
- B: *Oh*, ***of course***, *yes! I’d completely forgotten*.

We use *of course* when a situation or piece of information is not surprising:

- *Our car broke down on the way to the station so, **of course**, we missed the train and had to buy new tickets. It cost us £80!*
- *He’s mega-rich and, **of course**, he can afford to fly first class all the time.*

We use *of course* to mean ‘yes’ when we are giving permission to someone to do something:

- A: *Can I borrow your newspaper for a minute?*
- B: ***Of course***. *Go ahead*.

:::warning

We don’t use *of course* when we answer a question and give the listener information they do not already know. This can sound impolite:

- A: *When you were in London, did you go to any shows?*
- B: ***Yes, we did***. *We went to three*.
- Not: *~~Of course. We went to three~~*. (The listener A may hear *of course* as meaning ‘how could you think we didn’t go to any shows?’ and A may think B felt that A had asked a stupid question.)
