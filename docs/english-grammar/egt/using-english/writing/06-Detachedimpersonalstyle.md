# Detached impersonal style

Formal styles are common in English writing. There are many different kinds of formal style, and choice of grammar and vocabulary is important. Formal styles commonly contain few personal pronouns; noun phrases and the passive voice are commonly used. The more formal the style, the more likely it is that it will appear detached and impersonal.

## Few personal pronouns

Pronouns are replaced by impersonal constructions with *it* and *there*.

## Noun phrases

Noun phrases, rather than verb phrases, are common in detached impersonal styles. This process is sometimes called nominalisation.

## Passive voice

The passive voice is common in detached impersonal styles. It is also common in academic writing. The passive voice allows the writer to concentrate on processes, rather than on the actions of the human subject.
