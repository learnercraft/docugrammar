# Verbs: multi-word verbs

Multi-word verbs are verbs which consist of a verb and one or two particles or prepositions (e.g. *up, over, in, down*). There are three types of multi-word verbs: phrasal verbs, prepositional verbs and phrasal-prepositional verbs. Sometimes, the name ‘phrasal verb’ is used to refer to all three types.

## Phrasal verbs

Phrasal verbs have two parts: a main verb and an adverb particle.

The most common adverb particles used to form phrasal verbs are *around*, *at, away, down, in, off*, *on, out, over, round, up*:

- bring in
- go around
- look up
- put away
- take off

### Meaning

Phrasal verbs often have meanings which we cannot easily guess from their individual parts. (The meanings are in brackets.)

- *The book first **came out** in 1997.* (was published)
- *The plane **took off** an hour late.* (flew into the air)
- *The lecture **went on** till 6.30.* (continued)
- *It’s difficult to **make out** what she’s saying.* (hear/understand)

For a complete list of the most common phrasal verbs, see the *Cambridge International Dictionary of Phrasal Verbs*.

### Formality

Phrasal verbs are often, but not always, less formal than a single word with the same meaning.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>phrasal verb</td><td>more formal single word</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>We need to </i><b><i>sort</i></b><i> the problem </i><b><i>out</i></b><i>.</i></td><td><i>We need to </i><b><i>solve</i></b><i>/</i><b><i>resolve</i></b><i> the problem.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>The team only had an hour to </i><b><i>put</i></b><i> the stage </i><b><i>up</i></b><i> before the concert.</i></td><td><i>The team only had an hour to </i><b><i>erect</i></b><i>/</i><b><i>construct</i></b><i> the stage before the concert.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Phrasal verbs and objects

Many phrasal verbs take an object. In most cases, the particle may come before or after the object if the object is not a personal pronoun (*me, you, him, us*, etc.).

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>(p = particle; o = object [underlined])</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>particle before the object</td><td>particle after the object</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>She </i><b><i>brought</i></b><i> [P] </i><b><i>up</i></b><i> [O] three kids all alone.</i></td><td><i>I </i><b><i>brought</i></b><i> [O] my children [P] </i><b><i>up</i></b><i> to be polite.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Do you want me to </i><b><i>take</i></b><i> [P] </i><b><i>off</i></b><i> [O] my shoes?</i></td><td><i>Come in. </i><b><i>Take</i></b><i> [O] your coat [P] </i><b><i>off</i></b><i>.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

If the object is a personal pronoun (*me, you, him, us*, etc.), we always put the pronoun before the particle:

- *I’ve made some copies. Would you like me to **hand*** them ***out**?*
- Not: *~~Would you like me to hand out them?~~*

- *Oh, I can’t **lift*** you ***up** any more. You’re too big now!*
- Not: *~~I can’t lift up you any more.~~*

We usually put longer objects (underlined) after the particle:

- *Many couples do not want to* ***take on*** the responsibility of bringing up a large family of three or four children*.*

We can use some phrasal verbs without an object:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>break down</i></td><td><i>get back</i></td><td><i>move in/out</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>carry on</i></td><td><i>go off</i></td><td><i>run away</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>drop off</i></td><td><i>hang on</i></td><td><i>set off</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>eat out</i></td><td><i>join in</i></td><td><i>wake up</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

*The taxi **broke down** on the way to the airport and I thought I nearly missed my flight.*

*We’d better **set off** before the rush-hour traffic starts.*

*What time did you **wake up** this morning?*

A good learner’s dictionary will tell you if the phrasal verb needs an object or can be used without one.

## Prepositional verbs

Prepositional verbs have two parts: a verb and a preposition which cannot be separated from each other:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>break into (a house</i>)</td><td><i>get over (an illness</i>)</td><td><i>listen to</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>cope with (a difficult situation</i>)</td><td><i>get on</i></td><td><i>look after (a child</i>)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>deal with (a problem</i>)</td><td><i>get off</i></td><td><i>look at</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>depend on</i></td><td><i>go into</i></td><td><i>look for</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>do without</i></td><td><i>lead to</i></td><td><i>look forward to</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Prepositional verbs and objects

Prepositional verbs always have an object, which comes immediately after the preposition. The object (underlined) can be a noun phrase, a pronoun or the *\-ing* form of a verb:

- *Somebody* ***broke into*** his car *and stole his radio.*
- *I don’t like this CD. I don’t want to* ***listen to*** it *any more.*
- *Getting to the final* ***depends on*** winning the semi-final*!*

Some prepositional verbs take a direct object after the verb followed by the prepositional phrase.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>associate … with</i></td><td><i>remind … of</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>protect … from</i></td><td><i>rob … of</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>provide … with</i></td><td><i>thank … for</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

(do = direct object; po = object of preposition \[both underlined\])

*Hannah **reminds** \[DO\] me **of** \[PO\] a girlfriend of mine.*

*How can we **protect** \[DO\] children **from** \[PO\] dangerous material on the Internet?*

*I’d like to **thank** \[DO\] everyone **for** \[PO\] their kindness.*

## Prepositional verbs or phrasal verbs?

Not all phrasal verbs need an object. Prepositional verbs (e.g. *listen to, depend on*) always have an object after the preposition:

- *I’ve got a great new CD. Shall we* ***listen to*** it*?*
- Not: *~~Shall we listen to?~~*

With phrasal verbs the object can come before or after the particle if the object is not a pronoun. With prepositional verbs, the object is always immediately after the preposition.(Objects are underlined.)

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>Do you always </i><b><i>look up</i></b><i> </i>every new word<i> in a dictionary?</i><i>Do you always </i><b><i>look</i></b><i> </i>every new word<i> </i><b><i>up</i></b><i> in a dictionary?</i></td><td>Phrasal verb: the object can come before or after the particle <i>up</i>.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Could you </i><b><i>look after</i></b><i> </i>my bag<i> while I go and buy the tickets?</i></td><td>Prepositional verb: the object is after the preposition.Not: Could you look my bag after …</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Phrasal-prepositional verbs

Phrasal-prepositional verbs have three parts: a verb, a particle and a preposition. The particle and the preposition cannot be separated. Many of these verbs are often used in informal contexts, and their meaning is difficult to guess from their individual parts.

### Verb + particle + preposition

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>catch up with</i></td><td><i>get on with</i></td><td><i>look out for</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>come up against</i></td><td><i>listen out for</i></td><td><i>look up to</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>do away with</i></td><td><i>look down on</i></td><td><i>put up with</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>face up to</i></td><td><i>look forward to</i></td><td><i>watch out for</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>get away with</i></td><td><i>look in on</i></td><td><br/></td></tr></tbody></table>

*Ken’s just chatting to a friend. He’ll **catch up with** us in a minute.* (reach, join)

*Do you **get on with** your neighbours?* (have a good relationship with)

*We **look forward to** meeting you on the 22nd.* (anticipate with pleasure)

:::note[See also]

- *Look forward to*

### Phrasal-prepositional verbs and objects

The object (underlined below) always comes immediately after the preposition, and not in any other position:

- *She was a wonderful teacher. We all* ***looked up to*** her*.* (respected)
- Not: *~~We all looked her up to. or We all looked up her to.~~*

Some phrasal-prepositional verbs also take a direct object after the verb as well as an object of the preposition:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>fix … up with</i></td><td><i>put … down to</i></td><td><i>put … up to</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>let … in on</i></td><td><i>take … out on</i></td><td><br/></td></tr></tbody></table>

(do = direct object; po = object of preposition \[both underlined\])

*She **fixed** \[DO\] us **up*** ***with** \[PO\] a violin teacher. We’re really grateful to her.* (*fixed us up with* = arranged for us)

*We just **put \[DO\]** the accident **down to \[PO\]** bad luck; there’s no other reason.* (*put down to* = think the cause or reason is)
