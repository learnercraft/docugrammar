# Verbs and verb phrases: typical errors

We always need an *e* in the *\-ed* form (past simple and *\-ed* form) of regular verbs:

- *She **joined** the company two years ago.*
- Not: *~~She joind the company two years ago.~~*

With irregular verbs where the vowel changes from *i* to *a* to *u* (e.g. *beg*i*n, beg*a*n, beg*u*n*), take care to use *a* in the past simple and *u* in the *\-ed* form:

- *The film **began** at 7.30.* (past simple form)
- Not: *~~The film begun at 7.30.~~*

- *I was so thirsty I **drank** a whole bottle of water.* (past simple form)
- Not: *~~I was so thirsty I drunk~~* …

- *The ship **had sunk** in the North Atlantic.* (-*ed* form)
- Not: *~~The ship had sank~~* …

Other verbs like this are: *ring, sing, swim*.

Be careful with verbs which have similar pronunciation but a different meaning:

- *I **fell** and broke my ankle.*
- Not: *~~I felt and broke my ankle.~~* (*Fell* is the past tense of *fall*; *felt* is the past tense of *feel*.)

Sometimes a verb is confused with another word which sounds similar but is from a different word class:

- *You need to **practise** harder if you want to play better.*
- Not: *~~You need to practice harder.~~*

We don’t use prepositions with some verbs:

- *We **discussed** some environmental problems.*
- Not: *~~We discussed about some environmental problems.~~*

- *Did you **enjoy** Italy?*
- Not: *~~Did you enjoy in Italy?~~*

We have to use the correct preposition with prepositional verbs:

- *The download time **depends on** your internet connection speed.*
- Not: … ~~depends of your internet connection speed.~~

- *I like to **listen to** the radio while I’m having breakfast.*
- Not: *~~I like to listen the radio~~* …
