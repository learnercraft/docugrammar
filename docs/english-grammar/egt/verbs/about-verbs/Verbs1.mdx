# Verbs

Verbs are one of the four major word classes, along with nouns, adjectives and adverbs. A verb refers to an action, event or state.

These are verbs:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>actions</td><td>events</td><td>states</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>go</i></td><td><i>die</i></td><td><i>be</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>sing</i></td><td><i>happen</i></td><td><i>have</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>take</i></td><td><i>rain</i></td><td><i>know</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

*She always **sings** at parties.*

*It **rained** yesterday.*

*I only **know** his first name. I donâ€™t **know** his surname.*

## Using verbs

Some verbs can change their meaning or function depending on how they are used and what they combine with. Some verbs, such as *get*, *make* and *take* have many different meanings. Others, such as *be*, *do* or *have* can be used as main verbs or auxiliary verbs. (<a href={useBaseUrl("/category/common-verbs")}>Read more on common verbs.</a>)

## Verb forms

Main verbs in English have five different forms:

- the base form, also known as the infinitive, e.g. work, take;
- the past form, e.g. worked, took;
- the past participle or \-ed form, e.g. worked, taken (in regular verbs this takes the same form as the past, but in irregular verbs it can be different, e.g. took, taken.);
- the \-ing form, e.g. working, taking;
- the third person singular present simple , or \-s form, e.g. works, takes
