# Verbs: types

## Main verbs

Main verbs have meanings related to actions, events and states. Most verbs in English are main verbs:

- *We **went** home straight after the show.*
- *It **snowed** a lot that winter.*
- *Several different types of volcano **exist**.*

## Linking verbs

Some main verbs are called linking verbs (or copula verbs). These verbs are not followed by objects. Instead, they are followed by phrases which give extra information about the subject (e.g. noun phrases, adjective phrases, adverb phrases or prepositional phrases). Linking verbs include:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>appear</i></td><td><i>feel</i></td><td><i>look</i></td><td><i>seem</i></td><td><i>sound</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>be</i></td><td><i>get</i></td><td><i>remain</i></td><td><i>smell</i></td><td><i>taste</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>become</i></td><td><br/></td><td><br/></td><td><br/></td><td><br/></td></tr></tbody></table>

*A face* ***appeared*** at the window*. It was Pauline.* (prepositional phrase)

*He****’s*** a cousin of mine*.* (noun phrase)

*This coat* ***feels*** good*.* (adjective phrase)

*She* ***remained*** outside *while her sister went into the hospital.* (adverb phrase)

## Auxiliary verbs

There are three auxiliary verbs in English: *be, do* and *have*. Auxiliary verbs come before main verbs.

### Auxiliary be

Auxiliary *be* is used to indicate the continuous and the passive voice:

- *I**’m waiting** for Sally to come home.* (continuous)
- *Her car **was*** ***stolen** from outside her house.* (passive)

:::note[See also]

- Future continuous (*I will be working*)
- Passive

:::

### Auxiliary do

Auxiliary *do* is used in interrogative, negative and emphatic structures:

- ***Does*** *she live locally?* (interrogative)
- *They **didn’t** know which house it was.* (negative)
- *I* do *like your new laptop!* (emphatic, with spoken stress on *do*)

- Negation
- *Do* as an auxiliary verb

### Auxiliary have

Auxiliary *have* is used to indicate the perfect:

- *I**’ve*** ***lost** my memory stick. **Have** you **seen** it anywhere?* (present perfect)
- *She **had*** ***seen** my car outside the shop.* (past perfect)

:::note[See also]

- Present perfect simple (*I have worked*)
- Past perfect simple (*I had worked*)

:::

### Auxiliary verb with no main verb

An auxiliary verb can only appear alone when a main verb (or a clause containing a main verb) is understood in the context:

- A: *Does she play the clarinet?*
- B: *Yes, She* ***does***. (Yes, she plays the clarinet.)
- A: *It hasn’t snowed at all this year, has it?*
- B: *No, it* ***hasn’t***. (No, it hasn’t snowed.)

### Be, do and have as main verbs

*Be*, *do* and *have* can be used as auxiliary verbs or as main verbs.

:::warning

Remember, when *do* and *have* are main verbs, we must use auxiliary *do* to make questions and negatives:

- A: *What **does** Janet **do**?*
- B: *She’s a teacher*.
- Not: *~~What does Janet?~~*
- *I **don’t*** ***have** a car. I only have a bike.*

## Modal verbs

The main modal verbs are:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>can</i></td><td><i>may</i></td><td><i>must</i></td><td><i>should</i></td><td><i>would</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>could</i></td><td><i>might</i></td><td><i>shall</i></td><td><i>will</i></td><td><br/></td></tr></tbody></table>

Modal verbs have meanings connected with degrees of certainty and necessity:

- *We**’ll** be there around 7.30.* (speaker is quite certain)
- *A new window **could** cost around £500.* (speaker is less certain)
- *I **must** ring the tax office.* (speaker considers this very necessary)

Semi-modal verbs have some meanings related to the main modal verbs. The semi-modal verbs are *dare, need, ought to, used to*.

## State and action verbs

A verb refers to an action, event or state.

### Action

We can use the simple or continuous form of action verbs:

- *I **cleaned** the room as quickly as possible.*
- *She**’s watching** television at the moment.*

### Event

We can use the simple or continuous form of event verbs:

- *Four people **died** in the crash.*
- *It**’s raining** again.*

### State

We usually use the simple form rather than the continuous form of state verbs:

- *I **don’t know** the name of the street.*
- *Who **owns** this house?*

Some verbs can be used to talk about both states and actions, but with different meanings:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>state (usually simple form)</td><td>action (simple or continuous)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I </i><b><i>come</i></b><i> from France.</i>(This is where my home is.)</td><td><i>She </i><b><i>is coming</i></b><i> from France on Wednesday.</i><i>He </i><b><i>came</i></b><i> from Italy yesterday.</i> (travel from)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>She </i><b><i>is</i></b><i> very friendly.</i>(permanent quality or state)</td><td><i>She </i><b><i>is being</i></b><i> very unfriendly.</i> (temporary behaviour)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>We </i><b><i>have</i></b><i> two dogs.</i> (own)</td><td><i>We</i><b><i>’re</i></b><i> </i><b><i>having</i></b><i> a meeting to discuss it.</i> (hold a meeting)<i>We </i><b><i>had</i></b><i> mussels for starter and prawns for main course.</i> (eat)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>Do</i></b><i> you </i><b><i>see</i></b><i> what I mean?</i>(understand)</td><td><i>Jane </i><b><i>is</i></b><i> </i><b><i>seeing</i></b><i> her boss today and she’s going to tell him she’s leaving.</i><i>I don’t </i><b><i>see</i></b><i> Rebecca at work any more since I moved office.</i> (meet)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Your dress </i><b><i>looks</i></b><i> nice.</i>(appear)</td><td><i>What </i><b><i>are</i></b><i> you </i><b><i>looking</i></b><i> at?</i><i>I never </i><b><i>look</i></b><i> at the price on the menu.</i> (see with your eyes)</td></tr></tbody></table>

Spoken English:

In very informal speaking you will sometimes hear state verbs used as action verbs when they refer to actions over short periods. These uses are not usually found in traditional grammar books.
