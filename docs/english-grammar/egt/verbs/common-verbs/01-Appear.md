# Appear

## Appear: how something looks

We use *appear* to say how something looks or seems to look. We usually follow it by an adjective or by a *to*\-infinitive:

- *They **appear** very disappointed.*
- *There **appears** to be a problem with the car.*
- *The people don’t **appear** to know why they are here.*

Less often, and in more formal situations, we can use appear with an adjective + noun:

- *She **appears** quite a nervous driver.*

We can use *appear* with *it* as a subject, followed by *as if, as though* or *that:*

- *It **appears** as if you got the wrong directions to the school.*
- *It **appears** as though they were wrong.*
- *It **appears** that he was not the first choice.*

## Appear meaning ‘come into sight’

*Appear* also means ‘become noticeable’:

- *Suddenly the figure of a man **appeared** in the distance.*

## Appear or seem?

We mostly use *appear* to talk about facts and events. We use *seem* to talk about facts, but also to talk about personal feelings and ideas. *Seem* is often used with a noun:

- *His car **appears/seems** to have broken down.*
- *It **seems** crazy that we should have to pay twice!*
- Not: *~~It appears crazy~~* …

- *It **seemed** a good choice at the time.*
- Not: *~~It appeared a good choice~~* …
