## Do as an auxiliary verb

*Do* is one of three auxiliary verbs in English: *be, do, have*. We use *do* to make negatives (*do* + *not*), to make question forms, and to make the verb more emphatic.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>meaning</td><td>example</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>negative</td><td><i>I </i><b><i>didn’t see</i></b><i> you at the concert the other night.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>question form</td><td><b><i>Do</i></b><i> they </i><b><i>open</i></b><i> at nine o’clock on weekdays?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>emphatic</td><td><i>He </i><b><i>does look</i></b><i> smart in his new suit!</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Question (?) form

To make the question form of most main verbs, we use *do, does* (present simple) and *did* (past simple) followed by the subject and the main verb:

- ***Do you play*** *football?*
- ***Doesn’t he phone*** *you now and then?*
- ***Did your mother come*** *from the same place as your father?*

### Negative (−) form

The negative of the present simple and past simple of all main verbs (except for *be* and some uses of *have* as main verbs) is made with auxiliary *do + not*, which is shortened to *don’t* (do not), *doesn’t* (does not) and *didn’t* (did not). We use the short forms in everyday informal language, and the full forms in more formal situations:

- *I **don’t want** to wait for a bus. Let’s get a taxi.*
- *Jack **doesn’t live** in the town centre. He’s out in the suburbs.*
- ***Didn’t*** *you **get** my email? I sent it at about four o’clock.*
- *The Prime Minister **does not take** personal phone calls from members of the public.* (more formal)
- ***Did*** *the parents **not realise** that something serious had happened to their child?* (more formal)

- *Have* as a main verb

### Emphatic forms

We use *do, does* (present simple) or *did* (past simple) to give extra force to the main verb. We use the infinitive of the main verb without *to*, and stress *do/does/did* when speaking.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>neutral</td><td>emphatic</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I </i><b><i>like</i></b><i> your new jacket.</i></td><td><i>I </i><b><i>do like</i></b><i> your new jacket!</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>She </i><b><i>looks</i></b><i> so tired.</i></td><td><i>She </i><b><i>does look</i></b><i> so tired!</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I didn’t recognise your dad, but I </i><b><i>recognised</i></b><i> your mum.</i></td><td><i>I didn’t recognise your dad, but I </i><b><i>did recognise</i></b><i> your mum.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

We also use emphatic *do* with imperatives.

- ***Do come*** *and have dinner with us some time.*
- ***Do stop talking****, Harry! You’re boring everybody!*

### Question tags

We use auxiliary *do* to form question tags for clauses which do not have a modal verb, a verb in the perfect with *have* or clauses with *be*. The tag uses the same person and tense as the subject of the main verb. The tag may be affirmative or negative, depending on the type of tag:

- *You **work** with Peter, **don’t you**?* (affirmative main verb, negative tag)
- *She **plays** the piano, **doesn’t she**?*
- *Little children **don’t** usually **like** spicy food, **do they**?* (negative main verb, affirmative tag)
- *They **didn’t** stay very long, **did** they?*
- *You **live** near Harkness, **do you**?* (affirmative verb, affirmative tag)
- *They **arrived** late, **did they**?*

## Do as an auxiliary verb: typical errors

We don’t use auxiliary *do* to make questions or negatives for clauses with modal verbs:

- ***Will you be*** *here in time for lunch?*
- Not: *~~Do you will be here~~*…

- ***I can’t swim*** *very well.*
- Not: *~~I don’t can swim~~*…

We use auxiliary *do*, not auxiliary *be*, for questions with main verbs in the present simple:

- ***Do you live*** *in an apartment?*
- Not: *~~Are you live in~~*…

We use *does*, not *do*, for the third person in the present tense:

- ***Does*** *your sister have brown eyes too?*
- Not: *~~Do your sister have~~*…

## Do as a substitute verb

We often use *do* instead of repeating all the words in a clause. *Do* substitutes for the words we don’t repeat:

- A: *We went to the concert in the park this year*.
- B: *Yes, we **did** too*. (Yes, we went to the concert in the park too.)

We don’t use *do* alone if the substitute verb is in the *to-*infinitive form. In those cases, we omit the verb but keep *to*, or we use *do so*, *do it* or *do that*:

- *It’s not often I write letters to newspapers, but that day I desperately felt the need **to**. or … the need **to do so/it/that**.* (I desperately felt the need to write letters to newspapers.)
- Not: … ~~the need to do.~~

### Do so, do it, do that

We sometimes add *so*, *it* or *that* after the substitute *do*. *Do so, do it* and *do that* are sometimes used differently, but they are often interchangeable:

- *He said he was going to move to New Zealand and, to everyone’s surprise, he **did so/did it/did that**.*

### Do so

We use *do so* mostly to refer to actions where the subject and verb are the same as the ones we have mentioned. *Do so* is generally more formal than *do it* and *do that*:

- *I wanted them to leave, and politely asked them **to do so**, but they wouldn’t go, so I called the police.* (I wanted them to leave and I politely asked them to leave.)

:::warning

*Do so* is more formal than *do* on its own:

- A: *Do you mind if I open the present now?*
- B: *Yes, please* ***do so***. (*Do so* substitutes for *open the present now*)

:::

We often use *do so* when we make a general reference to a series of actions or events:

- *The birds make their nests on the north side of the island in little holes in the rocks. The reason why they **do so** is because the south side of the island is exposed to extreme winds.*

### Do it

We use *do it* when we refer to an action or an event involving a verb and an object, especially when the subject is different from the one already mentioned:

- A: *He accidentally deleted some emails on his computer*.
- B: *I **do it** all the time*. (I delete files all the time.)

### Do that

*Do that* is more emphatic and we use it for deliberate actions:

- A: *Would you ever give a complete stranger your phone number?*
- B: *No. I would never* ***do that***. (I would never give a complete stranger my phone number.)

We often use *do that* in situations where we are contrasting things:

- A: *Would you like to have a few nights in a motel?*
- B: *No, we’d prefer not to* ***do that***. *We’d rather have a nice hotel*. (We’d prefer not to have a few nights in a motel.)
- A: *I’ve decided to wait a year before starting college. I want to travel a bit and see the world*.
- B: *I really think you should **do that** rather than starting college. You’re still so young. College will still be an option this time next year*.

We can use a modal or an auxiliary verb + *do* to substitute for a main verb and what comes after it:

- A: *I feel terrible*.
- B: *You should go to the doctor*.
- A: *I* ***should do***, *I know, but I have so much work to finish*.
- A: *Has Martin met Paul before?*
- B: *He **could have done** at the sales meeting last year, but I’m not sure*.
