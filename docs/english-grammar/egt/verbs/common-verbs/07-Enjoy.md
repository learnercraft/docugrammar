# Enjoy

The regular verb *enjoy* means ‘get pleasure from something’. It usually has an object:

- *We **enjoyed** the movie so much.*
- ***Enjoy*** *your holiday in Ireland.*
- Not: *~~Enjoy in Ireland.~~*

We also use *enjoy* to talk about getting pleasure from a situation we are in. In this case, we say *enjoy myself, yourself, herself, himself*, etc.:

- *Did you **enjoy** yourself last night?*
- *We always **enjoy** ourselves when we go to Lynn’s house.*

:::warning

We use the -*ing* form after *enjoy* but we don’t use a *to-*infinitive:

- *I never **enjoyed** cycling.*
- Not: *~~I never enjoyed to cycle.~~*

- *They **enjoyed** meeting people on their trip around Italy.*
- Not: *~~They enjoyed to meet people on their trip~~* …

Spoken English:

In informal situations, *enjoy* is sometimes used on its own without an object. This is especially common in American English:

- A: *We’re now going out for dinner*.
- B: ***Enjoy!***
