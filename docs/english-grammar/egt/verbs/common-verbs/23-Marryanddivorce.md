# Marry and divorce

We usually use *marry* and *divorce* with an object:

- *Lauren Bacall* ***married*** her co-star, Humphrey Bogart*, in 1945 and made three more movies with him.*
- *He always needed more money, and at 77 he* ***married*** a wealthy widow*, but she* ***divorced*** him *a year later.*

However, in formal styles we use them without an object:

- *The couple **married** three years ago and have a daughter, Molly.*

In informal language we use *get married* and *get divorced* when there is no object:

- *Paul and Katia **are getting married** in New Zealand.*
- *She finally **got divorced** last year.*

We use *be married* and *be divorced* to describe the state of being married or divorced:

- *They**’re divorced** now.*
- *We’ve **been married** for 50 years.*

We don’t use *to* or *with* after *marry*:

- *She **married** someone she met at college.*
- Not: *~~She married to someone~~ … or ~~She married with someone~~* …

We use *to*, not *with*, after *get married* + direct object and *be married* + direct object:

- *She **got married to** someone she met at college.*
- *She’**s married to** someone she met at college.*
- Not: *~~She got married with someone~~ … or ~~She’s married with someone~~* …

We use *from* with *get divorced* and (less commonly) with *be divorced*:

- *She **got divorced from** her second husband.*
- *She **is divorced from** her second husband.*
- *She **divorced** her second husband.*
