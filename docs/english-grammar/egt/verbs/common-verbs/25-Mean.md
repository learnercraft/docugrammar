# Mean

## Understanding

We use *mean* to explain or ask what a word or phrase refers to. We form questions with *mean* with the auxiliary verb *do*:

- *What **does** ‘strike’* ***mean?***
- Not: *~~What means ‘strike’?~~*

:::warning

We don’t normally use *mean* in the continuous form when we are talking about expressing ideas:

- *What does that sign **mean**?*
- Not: *~~What is that sign meaning?~~*

:::

## Talking about intentions

We use *mean* to clarify something that we have said or to explain what we intended to say:

- A: *You have to take the road by the church*.
- B: *Which church?*
- A: *Here’s what* *I* ***mean***, *Lynn: there are two roads ahead. Take the right-hand road*.

We use *mean* followed by a *to*\-infinitive to express intentions:

- *Sorry, I **didn’t mean** to upset you.*
- *I **meant** to call you before I left. I forgot.*

We often use *keep meaning to* for longer-term intentions:

- *I’ve got to go to the dentist. I **keep meaning to** make an appointment.*

## Talking about significance

We use *mean* to say that something is important or significant:

- *The bracelet **meant** a lot to her. It had belonged to her grandmother.*
- *Does this name **mean** anything to you?*

## Mean: result in

We can use *mean* + noun to talk about one thing resulting in another:

- *Higher fuel prices will **mean** higher airfares.* (will result in or involve)

## Talking about necessity or obligation

We use *mean + -ing* form to talk about something necessary or the result of something:

- *I’ll have to catch the 7 am train to Nottingham, which **means** getting up at 5 am.* (I need to get up at 5 am.)

We also use the passive *be meant to* to express obligation. It has a similar meaning to ‘be supposed to’:

- *Why are you watching TV? You’**re meant to** be working.*

## Mean by

We can use *mean by* to ask what somebody is specifically thinking of when they use a word or phrase:

- A: *We don’t want to discourage her from studying*.
- B: *It depends what you **mean by** ‘discourage’*.
- A: *Well, I mean make her think we can’t afford to pay for her*.

## Means (noun)

Even though it ends in an ‘s’, *means* is a singular noun. We use a singular verb with it. We use it to talk about a method of doing something:

- *The most economical **means** of travelling to Aberdeen is by plane.* (the most economical method or way)
- Not: … ~~most economical mean~~ … or … ~~most economical means are~~ …

## I mean

Spoken English:

We use *I mean* very commonly in speaking as a discourse marker. We use it when we want to add to what we have just said, to make a point clearer or to correct what we have just said:

- *The law is not fair. **I mean**, it’s just not right that he didn’t go to prison.* (adding)
- *It cost over £200. **I mean**, that’s more than most of us can afford.* (making something clearer)
- *We need to ask Helen, **I mean** Harriet.* (correcting)

We often use *I mean* when hesitating, to make something negative less strong or to soften a disagreement:

- A: *What do you think of Ben?*
- B: *Well*, ***I mean***, *he’s not very confident and not always sure what he’s supposed to be doing*.
- *I think Peter probably has a strong view about that. It’s interesting … **I mean** I … what I said earlier and **I mean** Peter might disagree with me.*

When we are not sure what to say, we sometimes use *I mean*. We often pause before or after it:

- *She’s not coming back, er **I mean**, erm … she and I have broken up.*

:::warning

We don’t use *I mean* to introduce opinions. It is not the same as *I think*:

- *I **think** we should stay at the Lakeside Inn.*
- Not: *~~I mean we should stay at the Lakeside Inn.~~*

:::

## You know what I mean

Spoken English:

We often use the phrase *you know what I mean* (or *if you know what I mean* or *do you know what I mean?*) in speaking, to check that our listener understands what we are saying or to show that we assume the listener has the same opinion about something:

- A: *I just can’t go to Norah’s house*.
- B: *Why’s that?*
- A: *I just don’t like all the cats*. ***You know what I mean?*** *They’re everywhere even in the beds*.
- B: *Yeah, I have to say I’m not a fan of cats either*. (A is checking that B understands that she doesn’t like all the cats in Norah’s house and she assumes that B is going to understand)
- *Ken isn’t very helpful, **if you know what I mean**.*
- *We’ve got white on the walls in the back room now, but I think he feels as though, pink is not the right colour for the front room,* ***do you know what I mean?***
