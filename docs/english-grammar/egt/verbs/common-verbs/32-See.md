# See

We use the verb *see* to talk about using our eyes to be aware of what is around us:

- *He turned on the light so that he could **see**.*
- *Did you **see** that falling star?*

We can use *see* followed by an object and a verb in different constructions:

- *We **saw** their car drive past the house yesterday.* (*see* + object + base form)
- Not: *~~We saw their car to drive past~~* …
- *Did you **see** the children playing?* (*see* + object + -*ing* form)
- *On television, we **saw** Nelson Mandela presented with a special prize.* (*see* + object + *\-ed* form)

Spoken English:

When we see something as we are speaking, we usually say *can see* rather than the simple (*I see*) or continuous form (*I’m seeing*):

- *I **can see** you in the photo. Look, there you are at the very back.*

We use *see* to mean ‘understand, know or be aware of something’. We don’t usually use this in continuous form:

- \[one person is explaining how to use a computer software program\]
- A: *… All that appears on the screen is what you put in the value*.
- B: ***I see***. *Right*.
- Not: *~~I’m seeing.~~*

We can use *you see* when we are explaining something.

- *They had no children. They married late*, ***you see***.

We also use *see* to mean ‘meet or come into contact with someone’, or ‘visit a place’:

- *We went to **see** my mother at the weekend.*
- ***Have*** *you **seen** Jerry lately?*

We can use the continuous form of *see* when it refers to an arrangement to meet someone:

- *I**’m*** ***seeing** Harry at ten o’clock tomorrow. What shall I tell him?*

We can also use the continuous form of *see* to mean ‘meeting someone as part of a romantic relationship’:

- *I asked her to go out on a date with me but she told me she **was** already **seeing** someone.*
