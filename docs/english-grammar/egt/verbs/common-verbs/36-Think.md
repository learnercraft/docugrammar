# Think

## Think meaning ‘have an opinion’

We can use *think* to talk about having an opinion or idea. In this case, we don’t usually use the continuous form:

- *I **think** (that) she’s a very selfish person.*
- Not: *~~I’m thinking (that) she’s a very selfish person.~~*
- *Ryan **thinks** we should leave by 8 am at the latest.*
- A: *What do you **think** about this frame?*
- B: *To be honest, I don’t **think** it suits the picture*.

## Think meaning ‘make plans or decisions’

We use *think of* or *think about* to talk about making plans and decisions. We can use it in the continuous form (*thinking of/about*) plus the -*ing* form of the verb:

- *We**’re thinking of** moving out of London and buying a small cottage in the country.*
- ***Thinking about*** *returning to college? Call Farrings College at Freephone 0800 009 122 445 for advice on courses and grants.*

## Think about meaning ‘consider something’

## Softening

Spoken English:

In speaking, we often use *I think* to soften what we say. It usually goes in end position:

- *It’s too expensive, **I think**.*
- *Too many people are talking in the office, **I think**. It’s difficult to work at times.*

## Uncertainty

When we use *I think* to express uncertainty, it usually goes at the beginning:

- ***I think*** *I gave the file to Holly on Monday.*
- ***I think*** *your keys are on the table.*

## Don’t think: expressing uncertainty

When we use *think* to express uncertainty, we usually put *not* with *think* rather than in the clause which comes afterwards:

- *I **don’t think** we have enough people interested in going on the trip.* (preferred to *I think we don’t have enough people interested in going on the trip*.)
- *She **didn’t think** it was necessary to give the taxi driver a tip.* (preferred to *She thought it wasn’t necessary to give the taxi driver a tip.)*
