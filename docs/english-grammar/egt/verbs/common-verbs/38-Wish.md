# Wish

## Wish \+ to\-infinitive

When we use *wish* followed by a verb in the *to*\-infinitive form, *wish* means the same as *want*, but it is more formal. We do not normally use *wish* in the continuous form when we use it with a *to*\-infinitive:

- *I **wish*** ***to speak** to Mr Hennessy, please.*
- Not: *~~I’m wishing to speak to~~* …

We don’t use a *that*\-clause after *wish* when it is a more formal version of *want*:

- ***I wish to visit*** *you in the summer, if possible.*
- Not: *~~I wish (that) I visit you in the summer~~* …

We can use an object (underlined), before the *to*\-infinitive:

- *I did not **wish*** my family ***to know** about Sara, so I told them nothing.*

When we use an object after *wish*, we must also use a verb in the *to*\-infinitive form. Alternatively, we can say *want* or (more politely) *would like*:

- *We* ***wish to have*** a table *near the window, please.* (or *We* ***would like*** a table *near the window, please*.)
- Not: *~~We wish a table near the window~~* …

## Wish \+ indirect object + direct object

We use *wish* with two objects, an indirect object + a direct object (underlined), for expressions of good wishes and hopes that good things will happen to people:

(io = indirect object; do = direct object)

- *I **wish** \[IO\]* you *\[DO\]* success *in your new job.*
- *I’ve got my driving test tomorrow. **Wish** \[IO\]* me *\[DO\]* luck*!*
- *We **wish** \[IO\]* you *\[DO\]* a long and happy life *together.*

## Wish \+ that\-clause

We use *wish* with a *that*\-clause when we regret or are sorry that things are not different. We imagine a different past or present:

- *I just **wish** that everything could be as it used to be.*

In informal situations, we usually omit *that*:

- *I **wish** I had his mobile phone number; we could tell him the good news.* (I don’t have his mobile phone number; it would be good if I had it.)
- *I **wish** you hadn’t told me how the film ends. You’ve spoilt it for me.* (You told me how the film ends; it would have been better if you had not told me.)

## Wish \+ verb forms in the that\-clause

The verb forms we use in *that*\-clauses after *wish* are similar to the verb forms in conditional clauses after *if*. We use a past verb form for present and future meanings.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>if</i></b></td><td><b><i>wish</i></b></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>It would be good </i><b><i>if</i></b><i> we </i><b><i>had</i></b><i> a bigger car.</i></td><td><i>I </i><b><i>wish</i></b><i> we </i><b><i>had</i></b><i> a bigger car.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>It would be good </i><b><i>if</i></b><i> I </i><b><i>knew</i></b><i> how to use this DVD player.</i></td><td><i>I </i><b><i>wish</i></b><i> I </i><b><i>knew</i></b><i> how to use this DVD player.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

When we wish something about the past, we use the past perfect after *wish*:

- *I **wish** I **had known** Charlie was coming. I would have invited Jane.* (I didn’t know it and did not invite Jane.)
- *I **wish** I* ***hadn’t said that. I can see I’ve upset you. Sorry.*** (I did say it; it would have been better if I had not said it.)

## Wish \+ would

We can use *wish* + *would* if we are annoyed about something that is or is not happening, or about something that will or will not happen:

- *I **wish** you**’d** stop making so much noise!* (You *are* making a noise; it would be better if you didn’t.)
- *I **wish** you **wouldn’t** come through the kitchen with your dirty boots on.* (You do come through the kitchen; it would be better if you didn’t.)

In informal situations, we can use *wish* in the continuous form like this:

- *He’s embarrassing everyone. I**’m** just **wishing** he would go away!*

:::warning

We use *hope*, not *wish*, when we want something to happen in the future or when we want something to have happened in the past:

- *I **hope** the weather’s fine tomorrow.*
- Not: *~~I wish the weather’s fine tomorrow.~~*

- *I **hope** they didn’t miss their flight.*
- Not: *~~I wish they didn’t miss their flight.~~*
