# Look

We use the verb *look* to mean ‘turn our eyes in a particular direction to see something’. It is followed by *at* to refer to the person or thing which we see:

- *He’s **looking at** me.*
- Not: *~~He’s looking me.~~*
- ***Look****, there’s a massive spider!*
- *Don’t **look** now.*
- \[In a shop\]
- A: *Can I help you?*
- B: *No thank you, I’m just* ***looking***.

:::warning

We don’t use *look* with *if* or *whether*. We use *see* instead:

- *Can you **see if** there are any biscuits in the cupboard?*
- Not: *~~Can you look if there are~~* …

*Look* is used to form a number of phrasal and prepositional verbs (*look for, after, look up*, etc.). A good dictionary will give you information on these verbs.

## Look as a linking verb

We often use *look* as a linking verb like *appear, be, become, seem*. As a linking verb, *look* does not take an object and it is followed by a phrase or clause which gives more information about the subject (a complement):

- *That picture **looks** old.*
- *That jacket **looks** very expensive.*

*Look* as a linking verb is sometimes followed by *like*, *as if* or *as though*:

### look like \+ noun phrase

- *He **looks like** someone famous.*
- *It **looks like** a nice day outside.*

### look as if/as though \+ clause

- *She **looks as if** she is going to cry.*
- *They **looked as though** they had seen a ghost.*

## Look as a discourse marker

We sometimes use *look* as a discourse marker but it needs to be used carefully as it is very strong. We use it when we are explaining something or making a point, especially when we are annoyed or speaking very forcefully:

- \[in a political debate\]
- ***Look****, too many people have died in this war.*
- \[a boss talking to an employee\]
- ***Look****, Mark, you have been late for work every day this week. Is there a reason?*
