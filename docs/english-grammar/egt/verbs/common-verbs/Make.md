# Make

The verb *make* can be used in a number of ways.

## Make \+ object

We use *make* + object to talk about things that we produce or create:

- *She **made** some coffee.*
- *Did you really **make** this table?*

## Make meaning ‘force to do’

We can use *make* meaning ‘force someone (to do something)’. In the active voice, we use it with an infinitive without *to*:

- *The boss **made** me work an extra day.*
- Not: *~~The boss made me to work~~* …

However, in the passive voice, we must use an infinitive with *to*:

- *The people **were made** to wait outside while the committee reached its decision.*
