# Own

*Own* is a determiner and a pronoun.

*Own* emphasises that a thing belongs to a particular person, or was done by them. We always use a possessive form before *own*.

## Own as a determiner

We can use *own* as a determiner after a possessive determiner (e.g. *my, her, our*) or after a possessive noun phrase with *’s*:

*I never sleep well in hotels. I always sleep best in **my own** bed at home.*

*That garden wall is all **Jason’s own** work. He spent several weekends building it.*

## Own as a pronoun

We can use *own* as a pronoun after a possessive determiner (e.g. *my, his, their*). We often use it in the pattern *noun + of +* possessive determiner *\+ own*:

*This is my wife’s laptop. **My own** is being repaired.*

*Did you have a flat **of your own** when you were a student, or did you share?*

## Own: very own

We can emphasise *own* by using *very*:

*When I was eight, we moved to a bigger house and I got **my very own** room and didn’t have to share with my sister any more.*

## Own: on my own

*On my own, on your own, on our own*, etc. mean ‘alone’ or ‘without help from another person’. They are less formal than *alone*. We can emphasise them by using *all*:

*She lives **on her own** in a tiny flat.* (alone)

*Nobody helped him build his boat. He did it **all on his own**.* (without help from anyone)

## Typical error

We don’t use articles (*a/an*, *the*) before *own*:

*As soon as teenagers reach the age of seventeen, they want their **own** car. They don’t want to depend on* mum and dad any more.

Not: … they want the own car. or … they want an own car.
