# Seem

*Seem* means ‘appear in a particular way’. We can use it as a linking verb (like *be*) or with a *to*\-infinitive. We do not normally use *seem* in the continuous form:

- *She **seems** very young to be a teacher.*
- Not: *~~She is seeming~~* …
- *I **seem** to be the only person who hasn’t heard the news.* (+ *to*\-infinitive)

## Seem as a linking verb

*Seem* as a linking verb is followed by an adjective or, less commonly, a noun:

- *It **seems** strange that no one noticed that the window was broken.* (+ adjective)
- *Glenda **seems** happier these days.*
- *Buying a new car **seems** a complete waste of money to me. A used one would be just as good.* (+ noun)

We can use the impersonal construction *it seems* or *it seemed* with a *that*\-clause, or with *as if* or *as though* and a clause:

- ***It seems*** ***that*** *the village shop will have to close down. They can’t find a buyer for it.*
- ***It seems*** ***as if*** *he wants everyone to feel sorry for him, but I don’t.*
- ***It seemed*** ***as though*** *time was standing still. She wanted that moment to last forever.*

When *seem* is followed by a clause, we can refer to the person who experiences the situation using a prepositional phrase with *to*:

- *It **seemed** to everyone **that** the police were over-reacting, but no one dared to criticise them.*
- *It **seems** to me **as though** she needs help.*

*It seems like* and a clause is less formal than *it seems that* …:

- ***It seems*** ***like*** *he’s going to sell his house and move to Canada.* (more formal: ***It seems that*** *he’s going to …*)

## Seem \+ to\-infinitive

We can use *seem* with a *to*\-infinitive:

- *Tony always **seems** to offend people.*
- *Everybody **seemed** to be ready, so we set off.*
- *The old man **seems** to have mistaken us for some people he knew years ago.*

We can also use the impersonal construction *there seems to be* or *there seemed to be*, followed by a noun:

- ***There seems to be*** *a mistake in these calculations. Can we check them?*
- ***There seemed to be*** *no reason why she should not come with us, so we all travelled together.*
