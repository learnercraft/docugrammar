# Want

We use the verb *want* to talk about wishes and needs, and to give advice:

- *What do you **want** for dinner tonight?* (wish or desire)
- *The kitchen **wants** painting.* (needs)
- *You **want** to get your tickets soon before they’re all sold out.* (I advise you to)

Most uses of *want* involve the simple forms of the verb (*want, wants, wanted*). When we are talking about wishes or desires we can also use the continuous form (*is wanting, was wanting, will be wanting*).

## Want meaning ‘wish’ or ‘desire’

We always follow *want* with a complement of some kind. The complement completes the meaning of the clause. The complement can be a noun or pronoun as an object, or a verb in the *to*\-infinitive form, or an object plus a verb in the *to*\-infinitive form:

- A: *D’you **want** a drink? I’ve just made some coffee*. (noun object)
- B: *Oh, yes, please*.
- Not: *~~D’you want?~~*

- *She said I could have her old bike, but I don’t **want** it.* (pronoun object)
- Not: … ~~but I don’t want.~~

- *This is a new kind of fruit juice I got. D’you **want** to try it?* (*to*\-infinitive)
- Not: *~~Do you want try it?~~*
- *The teacher **wants** her to do the exams again next year.* (object + *to*\-infinitive)
- Not: *~~The teacher wants that she does the exams~~* …

In reduced clauses (e.g. short answers), we can use the *to* without its verb:

- A: *Is Elsa going to France with you?*
- B: *No. She doesn’t **want** to*. (She doesn’t want to go \[to France\].)
- Not: *~~She doesn’t want.~~*
- *He wanted to leave school at sixteen, but his parents didn’t **want** him to.*

:::warning

We don’t use *want* with a *that*\-clause:

- *I **want** you to tidy your room before the visitors come.*
- Not: *~~I want that you tidy your room~~* …

## Want with wh\-words (whatever you want)

We can use *wh*\-words such as *what, when, whenever, wherever, whoever* before *want*. In such cases, it is often not necessary to use the infinitive *to* after *want*:

- *You don’t have to stay for the whole lecture. You can leave **whenever** you **want**.* (or *… whenever you* ***want to***.)
- A: *Would you like some of these carrots from our garden?*
- B: *Oh, yes, please*.
- A: *Take **what** you* ***want***.

## Want with if

In statements with *if*, it is often not necessary to use the infinitive *to* after *want*:

- *She can park her car at our house, **if** she **wants**.*

However, we use the infinitive *to* after *want* in negative clauses with *if*:

- *He doesn’t have to stay the night **if** he **doesn’t*** ***want to**.*

## Want in the continuous form

We can use *want* in the continuous form to show indirectness or politeness:

- Customer: *We**’re*** ***wanting** to buy a new TV, but we’re not sure what to get*.
- Assistant: *Okay, sir. Let me show you some of them*.
- *I **was*** ***wanting** to ask you something. Are you free right now?*

We can also use the continuous form to emphasise an ongoing or repeated process:

- *We**’d*** ***been*** ***wanting** to go to New Zealand for years, so his sixtieth birthday was a good excuse.*
- *Now that she’s a teenager she**’s*** ***wanting** expensive things, you know, computers, clothes, sports stuff.*

## Want meaning ‘need’

We can use *want* with the -*ing* form of a verb to say that something is necessary or should be done. This usage is quite informal:

- *Your hair **wants*** ***cutting**.* (needs to be cut)
- *That cupboard **wants*** ***clearing** out.*

In informal situations, we can also use *want + -ing* in a similar way to the construction *have something done*:

- *Have you got any shirts you **want*** ***washing**?* (which you want to have washed)

## Want for advice and warnings

In informal situations, we can use *want* plus the *to*\-infinitive to advise, recommend or warn. It is almost always in the present simple, but we can also use it with *’ll* (the short form of *will*):

- *You **want** to be careful riding your bike in town. There’ve been some bad accidents lately.* (you should be careful)
- *What you’ll **want** to do, you’ll **want** to take that bit off and clean it with oil or something.*
