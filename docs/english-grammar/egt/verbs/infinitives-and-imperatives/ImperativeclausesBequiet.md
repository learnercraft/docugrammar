# Imperative clauses (Be quiet!)

We use imperative clauses when we want to tell someone to do something (most commonly for advice, suggestions, requests, commands, orders or instructions).

We can use them to tell people to do or not to do things. They usually don’t have a subject – they are addressed to the listener or listeners, who the speaker understands to be the subject. We use the base form of the verb:

- ***Have*** *fun.*
- ***Enjoy*** *your meal.*
- ***Stop*** *talking and **open** your books.*
- ***Don’t be*** *late.*

:::warning

We use the imperative carefully. It is a very direct form and we don’t generally use it to make requests or commands or to give instructions.

:::

We can use *just*, *please* or *if you wouldn’t mind* to make an imperative sound less direct:

- *Open the window a little more, **please, if you wouldn’t mind**.*
- Not: Open the window. (too direct)
- \[Two friends\]
- A: *Ann, are you ready?*
- B: ***Just*** *give me a minute*, ***please***.

- Commands and instructions
- Requests

## Imperatives with subject pronouns

For emphasis, we can use *you* in an imperative clause:

- \[a student and a teacher\]
- A: *Can I leave the room?*
- B: *No*. ***You stay*** *here*.

In negative imperatives of this type, *you* comes after *don’t*:

- *Maria, **don’t you try** to pay for this. I invited you for lunch and I insist on paying.*

:::warning

Be careful when using subject pronouns in imperative clauses, as they can sound very direct.

:::

We can also use words like *someone*, *somebody, no one*, *nobody, everyone*, *everybody*, especially in speaking:

- ***Somebody call*** *a doctor. Quick!*
- ***Everybody sit*** *down, please.*

## Imperatives with do

:::warning

When we use the emphatic *do* auxiliary, it makes an imperative sound more polite and more formal:

- \[at the beginning of a meal\]
- ***Do start****.* (formal)
- ***Do sit*** *down and make yourself comfortable.*

:::

We can use emphatic *do* in short answers without a main verb:

- A: *Can I use your phone to call a taxi?*
- B: ***Do***, *of course, by all means. It’s there on the desk*.

## Imperatives with let (let’s)

We use *let* to form first person and third person imperatives.

### First person

- ***Let me*** *see. What should I do?*
- ***Let’s*** *start at nine-thirty tomorrow, please. Okay?*

:::warning

In more formal contexts, we use the full form *let us*:

- \[at the beginning of a meeting\]
- ***Let us*** *begin by welcoming our new members.*

:::

We can use emphatic *do* with *let’s* in formal contexts:

- ***Do let’s*** *try to be more environmentally friendly.*

Very often we use *let’s* (*let us*) when we are referring to the first person singular (*me*):

- *I can’t find my keys. **Let’s** see, where did I last have them?* (or ***Let me*** *see*, …)

We can use *let’s* on its own in short responses, meaning ‘yes’, when we respond to a suggestion:

- A: *Shall we stop now and have a coffee break?*
- B: ***Let’s***.

### Third person

Third person imperatives are not common; they are formed with *let + him/her/it* or a noun phrase:

- \[B is joking\]
- A: *How will Patrick know which house is ours?*
- B: *Let **him** knock on all the doors until he finds ours!*

- *Let*, *let’s*

## Negative imperatives

To make negative imperatives, we use the auxiliary *do* + *not* + the infinitive without *to*. The full form *do not*, is rather formal. In speaking, we usually use *don’t*:

- \[a public notice\]
- ***Do not use*** *the lift in the event of fire.*
- ***Don’t tell*** *anyone that I was here.*

We can use *don’t* on its own in short responses:

- A: *Shall I show everyone the old photo of you?*
- B: *No*, ***don’t***. *It’s terrible!*

## Negative imperatives with subject pronoun

We can use emphatic pronoun *you* or *anyone/anybody* after *don’t* in negative imperatives, especially in informal speaking:

- ***Don’t you*** *worry. Everything will be okay.*
- *It’s a surprise party so **don’t anybody** mention it to Jim.*

## Negative imperative of let’s

We often use the phrase *let’s not*:

- ***Let’s not*** *forget to lock the door!*

We sometimes use *don’t let’s* in more formal contexts:

- ***Don’t let’s*** *mention anything about her husband. I think they’ve split up.*

## Question tags commonly used after imperatives

We sometimes use question tags with imperatives. They make the imperative less direct:

- *Turn on the light,* ***will you?***
- *Ask him,* ***can you?***

*Won’t you?* adds more emphasis to the imperative:

- *Write to me,* ***won’t you?***

The tag after a negative imperative is normally *will you*:

- *Don’t tell anyone,* ***will you?***

## Imperatives as offers and invitations

We can use imperatives to make offers and invitations:

- ***Have*** *another piece of melon.*
- *Please **stay** another night. You know you’ll be most welcome.*
- ***Go on! Come*** *to the match with us tonight.*
- ***Don’t be*** *afraid to ask if you want anything.*
