# Perfect infinitive with to (to have worked)

We form the perfect infinitive with *to have* + the *\-ed* form of a verb. We use the perfect infinitive after verbs such as *claim, expect, hate, hope, like, love, prefer, pretend*:

- *He pretended **to have lost** her number and so had been unable to contact her.* (or *He pretended **that he had lost** her number …*)

The perfect infinitive often refers to things that might have happened in the past:

- *She claims **to have met** a number of famous people, but I don’t believe her.* (or *She claims **she has met** …*)
- *I would prefer **to have stayed** at a small, family-run hotel than a big international chain.* (I prefer to stay at small hotels, but I did not.)

The perfect infinitive can refer to something that will be completed at a point in the future:

- *We hope **to have finished** the building works by the end of March.*

We can use the perfect infinitive in a clause with a verb that has no subject (a non-finite clause). It can refer to events which did happen in the past or to events that might have happened (but did not happen):

- ***To have got*** *the job in the face of such stiff competition was a great achievement.* (The person did get the job.)
- ***To have won*** *the race would have been fantastic, but even coming second was a great achievement.* (The person did not win the race.)
