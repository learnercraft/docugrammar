# Modality: typical errors

We use the infinitive without *to* after modal verbs:

- *You really **must** go to bed now.*
- Not: *~~You really must to go to bed now.~~*
- *I **can** ski very well now.*
- Not: *~~I can to ski very well now.~~*

Modal verbs have no *to*\-infinitive form, -*ing* form, *\-ed* past form or -*ed* form. Because they have only one form, we have to reword what we want to say by using other expressions:

- *We’d like to **be able*** ***to** help you in some way.*
- Not: *~~We’d like to can help you in some way.~~*
- *She **had to** pay a fine for driving over the speed limit.*
- Not: *~~She musted pay a fine for driving over the speed limit.~~*

We use *not* or *n’t* after the modal verb to make the negative form. We do not use *don’t*/*doesn’t/didn’t*:

- *You ca**n’t** park here.*
- Not: *~~You don’t can park here.~~*

- Modal verbs

We normally put adverbs after modal verbs:

- *You **should always** keep your PIN in a safe place.*
- Not: *~~You always should keep your PIN in a safe place.~~* (PIN = Personal Identification Number)
- *We **must only** stay until 9 pm.*
- Not: *~~You only must stay until 9 pm.~~*
