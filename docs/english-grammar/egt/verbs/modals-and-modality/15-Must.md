# Must

## Must: forms

### Affirmative (+) form

*Must* comes first in the verb phrase (after the subject and before another verb):

- *She **must** have lots of friends.*

*Must* can’t be used with another modal verb.

- *This **must** be your sister.*
- Not: *~~This must can be your sister~~. or ~~This can must be your sister.~~*

### Negative (−) form

The negative form of *must* is *mustn’t*. We don’t use *don’t*/*doesn’t/didn’t* with *must*:

- *There **mustn’t** be any rubbish left.*
- Not: *~~There dosen’t must be any rubbish left.~~*

We can use the full form *must not* in formal contexts or when we want to emphasise something:

- *You **must not** leave any rubbish.*

- Modal verbs

### Question (?) form

:::warning

The subject and *must* change position to form questions. We don’t use *do/does/did*:

- ***Must*** *you make that noise?*
- Not: *~~Do you must make that noise?~~*

:::

We can use *must* and *mustn’t* in question tags though tags with *must* aren’t very common:

- *The house must be worth millions, **mustn’t** it?*

## Must: uses

### Deductions and conclusions

When we think carefully about facts, we often use *must* to express deductions and conclusions from these:

- *\[fact\] He’s so small. \[deduction/conclusion\] He **must** be no more than four years old.*
- \[Two teachers talking about a student\]
- A: *He falls asleep in class every morning*. (fact)
- B: *He **must** be out late every night or maybe he works at night*. (deduction/conclusion)

:::warning

We use *can’t/cannot* as the negative of *must* to deny something or make negative deductions or conclusions:

- *It just **can’t** be true. He **can’t** have left his job.*
- *That **cannot** be his sister. She looks so different.*

:::note[See also]

- *Can*

:::

:::warning

We use *must have + ed* form and *can’t have* + *ed* form to talk about deductions in the past. They always refer to deduction, not obligation:

- \[A wanted to talk to B so she phoned him but he didn’t answer the phone. She phoned again the next day\]
- A: *I called you yesterday around three o’clock but you **must have been** out*.
- B: *We **must have been** in the garden. That’s a pity*.
- \[A is telling B about his illness\]
- A: *I spent a month in hospital before I was able to walk*.
- B: *That **can’t have been** easy for you*.

:::

Spoken English:

In speaking, we very often express our reaction to what we hear using phrases such as *that must be* or *that must have been*:

- A: *She lives in Thailand now*.
- B: ***That must be*** *amazing!*
- A: *Twelve years ago Kevin and I went on a six-week camping trip*.
- B: ***That must have been*** *fun*.

### Obligation and necessity

*Must* expresses strong obligation and necessity:

- *I **must** talk to you about the new project.*
- *Seat belts **must** be worn even in the back of the car.*
- *There **must** be a minimum of two members of the company at the meeting.*

:::warning

We use *had to* not *must* to expresses obligation and necessity in the past:

- *By the time we got back to our bikes, it was dark and we **had to** cycle home in the dark without any lights …*
- Not: … ~~it was dark and we must cycle home in the dark~~ …

- *Last year, teachers **had to** make a report on each child every week.*
- Not: *~~Last year, teachers must make a report~~* …

:::

We use *must* to talk about the future in the past when we report speech or people’s thoughts in formal contexts:

- \[Extract from a novel\]
- *The pain was back in full force, but she knew she **must** not give in to it. She **must** go on day by day.*

We use *will have to* more than *must* to express future obligation, especially when talking about obligations at a particular point in the future:

- *He**’ll have to**wait five weeks for his eye operation. Then he**’ll have to** have both eyes operated on.*

We often use *must* with more general references to the future, particularly when talking about obligations that come from the speaker:

- *The Prime Minister **must** decide in the next month.*
- *I **must** try harder next time.*
- *I **must** pop round one evening next week.*

When we talk about no obligation, we use either *need not*, *don’t/doesn’t/didn’t have to* or the negative of the main verb *need* (*don’t/doesn’t need*):

- *You **needn’t** worry about it. I’ll take care of it.*
- *You **don’t have to** worry about it. I’ll take care of it.*
- *You **don’t need to** worry about it. I’ll take care of it.*

### Rules and laws

We use *must not* to talk about what is not permitted:

- *You **must not** park outside the entrance.*
- *You **must not** make noise after 9 o’clock.*

*Must* and *must not* often occur in public signs and notices indicating laws, rules and prohibitions:

- \[airline website information\]
- *All passengers **must** present valid photo identification at check-in for all flights.*
- \[bus company website notice\]
- *Tickets **must** be retained for inspection, and **must** be produced for inspection on request by any authorised official of Bus Éireann.* (*Bus Éireann* is the name of the Irish national bus company)

We also use *must* to express polite invitations or encouragement:

- *You **must** come and see us soon.*
- *You **must** try some of this chocolate cake. It’s delicious.*
- *You **must** go and see that film.*

### Criticisms

We use the question form of *must* in criticisms:

- ***Must*** *you keep playing that terrible music?*
- *Why **must** you mispronounce my name every time?*

## Must and have (got) to?

### Obligations

We usually use *must* to talk about obligations which come from the speaker and we generally use *have (got) to* when we refer to obligations that come from outside the speaker.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>I </i><b><i>must</i></b><i> buy some new clothes. Mine look so old.</i></td><td>The obligation is from me to buy new clothes.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I</i><b><i>’ve got to</i></b><i> buy some new clothes. I’m starting a new job as a teacher and we </i><b><i>have to</i></b><i> wear formal clothes.</i></td><td>The obligation is from the school to buy new clothes.</td></tr></tbody></table>

:::warning

*Must not* and *don’t have to/haven’t got to* have different meanings.

:::

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>You </i><b><i>must not</i></b><i> give my credit card details to anyone.</i><i>You </i><b><i>mustn’t</i></b><i> tell this to anyone. It’s a secret.</i></td><td>We use <i>mustn’t</i> to talk about something which is forbidden.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>You </i><b><i>don’t have to</i></b><i> tell anyone. I will email everyone.</i><i>We </i><b><i>haven’t got to</i></b><i> wear a uniform to work.</i></td><td>We use <i>don’t have to/haven’t got to</i> when something is not necessary. It is not forbidden.</td></tr></tbody></table>

*Don’t have to* can sometimes be used to criticise someone or to tell them not to do something. This is less direct than *must not*:

- *You **don’t have to** drink all of the juice!* (stop drinking the juice!)

### Deductions

We can also use *have got to* when we make deductions or draw conclusions. *Must* is more common than *have (got) to* in this meaning:

- *That **must** be a fake!*
- *That picture has **got to** be a fake!*

:::note[See also]

- *Have got to* and *have to*

:::

## Must: typical errors

We don’t use *must* to expresses obligation and necessity in the past. We use *had to* instead:

- *When she got home, she **had to** cook dinner before everyone arrived.*
- Not: *~~When she got home, she must cook dinner before~~* …

We don’t use *must* to make predictions about the future. We use *will* instead:

- *Don’t worry about our accommodation because I found a nice hotel which **will** be suitable for us.*
- Not: *~~Don’t worry about our accommodation because I found a nice hotel which must be suitable for us.~~*
