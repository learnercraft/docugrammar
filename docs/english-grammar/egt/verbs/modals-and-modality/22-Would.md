# Would

## Would: form

### Affirmative form

*Would* comes first in the verb phrase (after the subject and before another verb):

- *Dad **would sing** to us every evening.*

*Would* cannot be used with another modal verb:

- *When Tracy opened the door, she thought she **would** find an empty room.*
- Not: … ~~she thought she would might find an empty room~~. or … ~~she thought she might would find an empty room.~~

### Negative form

The negative form of *would* is *wouldn’t*. We don’t use *don’t*, *doesn’t, didn’t* with *would*:

- *There **wouldn’t** be any food in the house.*
- Not: *~~There didn’t would be any food in the house.~~*

We use the full form *would not* in formal contexts or when we want to emphasise something:

- *Your father **would*** ***not** approve.*

### Question form

The subject and *would* change position to form questions. We don’t use *do, does, did*:

- ***Would*** *that be a good idea?*
- Not: *~~Does this would that be a good idea?~~*
- ***Wouldn’t*** *that be a good idea?*

We can use *would* and *wouldn’t* in question tags:

- *She wouldn’t be any help, **would** she?*
- *They would enjoy that, **wouldn’t** they?*

## Would: uses

### Requests

We often use *would* to make requests. It is a more polite and indirect form of *will*.

### Conditional sentences

We often use *would* (or the contracted form *’d*) in the main clause of a conditional sentence when we talk about imagined situations:

- *If we had left earlier, we **would** have been able to stop off for a coffee on the way.*
- *If we went to Chile, we**’d** have to go to Argentina as well. I’d love to see both.*

### Habitual actions in the past

We use *would* to refer to typical habitual actions and events in the past. This is usually a formal use and it often occurs in stories (narratives):

- *I had a friend from Albany, which is about 36 miles away, and we **would** meet every Thursday morning and she **would** help us.*
- *Then he **would** wash; then he **would** eat his toast; then he **would** read his paper by the bright burning fire of electric coals.*

:::warning

We can’t use *would* in this way to talk about states. In these cases, we say *used to* instead of *would*:

- *I **used to** live in Melbourne when I was a kid.*
- Not: *~~I would live in Melbourne when I was a kid.~~*

- *Used to*

### Talking about the future in the past

We use *would* to talk about the future in the past. The speaker looks forward in time from a point in the past (underlined below):

- When I was young *I thought that in years to come I **would** be really tall.*
- When I broke my leg*, I thought I **would** never dance again.*

### Reported clauses

We use *would* as the past form of *will* in reported clauses.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>statement with <b><i>will</i></b></td><td>reported</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>‘I</i><b><i>’ll</i></b><i> pay for the food,’ said Tom.</i></td><td><i>Tom said that he </i><b><i>would</i></b><i> pay for the food.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Weather forecast:</i><i>There </i><b><i>will</i></b><i> be clear skies in the morning but it </i><b><i>will</i></b><i> be cloudy for the afternoon.</i></td><td><i>The weather forecast said that there </i><b><i>would</i></b><i> be clear skies in the morning but that it </i><b><i>would</i></b><i> be cloudy for the afternoon.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Willingness in the past

We use *would* to talk about willingness in past time situations. We usually use the negative form *wouldn’t* in this case:

- *The CD wasn’t working so I brought it back to the shop but they **wouldn’t** give me my money back because they said the box had already been opened.*

### Being less direct

We often use *would* with verbs such as *advise, imagine, recommend, say, suggest, think* to make what we say less direct.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>advise</i></td><td><i>I</i><b><i>’d</i></b><i> </i><b><i>advise</i></b><i> you to keep working on your grammar.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>imagine</i></td><td><i>I</i><b><i>’d</i></b><i> </i><b><i>imagine</i></b><i> it can’t be easy for you.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>recommend</i></td><td><i>I</i><b><i>’d</i></b><i> </i><b><i>recommend</i></b><i> that you try this size.</i> (formal)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>say</i></td><td><i>I</i><b><i>’d</i></b><i> </i><b><i>say</i></b><i> you are about 40.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>suggest</i></td><td><i>We</i><b><i>’d</i></b><i> </i><b><i>suggest</i></b><i> that you take this route. It’s more scenic.</i> (formal)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>think</i></td><td><i>It’s much further than Dublin, I </i><b><i>would</i></b><i> think.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Would or will?

We can use w*ould* as a more formal or polite alternative to *will* in requests. We often use the phrase *would you mind* + -*ing* in polite requests.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>Will</i></b><i> you give me a wake-up call at 7 am, please?</i></td><td><b><i>Would</i></b><i> you mind giving me a wake-up call at 7 am, please?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><b><i>Will</i></b><i> you excuse me just one second?</i></td><td><b><i>Would</i></b><i> you excuse me just one second?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><br/></td><td>Using <i>would</i> makes the request more formal and polite.</td></tr></tbody></table>

*Will* and *would* can both refer to willingness. We use *will* for present and future time and *would*, usually in the negative, for past time:

- *John **will** carry your suitcase. It’s far too heavy for you.* (present)
- *The taxi driver **wouldn’t** take more than four in the car.* (past)

:::warning

There are a number of phrases with *would* where *will* cannot be used:

- ***Would*** ***you like*** *your steak well cooked?*
- Not: *~~Will you like your steak well cooked?~~*

- ***Would*** ***you mind*** *introducing me to him?*
- Not: *~~Will you mind introducing me to him?~~*

- ***Would*** ***you*** ***rather*** *pay by credit card?*
- Not: *~~Will you rather pay by credit card?~~*
