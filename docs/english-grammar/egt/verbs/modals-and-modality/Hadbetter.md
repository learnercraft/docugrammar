# Had better

## Had better: form and meaning

We use *had better* to refer to the present or the future, to talk about actions we think people should do or which are desirable in a specific situation. The verb form is always *had*, not *have*. We normally shorten it to ’*d better* in informal situations. It is followed by the infinitive without *to*:

- *It’s five o’clock. I****’d better*** go *now before the traffic gets too bad.*
- Not: *~~I’d better to go now.~~*
- *The democratic movement **had better** concentrate on the immediate issues of the economy and security.* (more formal)

*Had better* is a strong expression. We use it if we think there will be negative results if someone does not do what is desired or suggested:

- *She**’d better** get here soon or she’ll miss the opening ceremony.*

Spoken English:

Sometimes people say *had best* instead of *had better*, especially in informal speaking. This sounds slightly less strong and less direct:

- *You**’d best** leave it till Monday. There’s no one in the office today.*

## Had better: negative and question forms

The negative of *had better* is *had better not* (or *’d better not*):

- *I**’d better not** leave my bag there. Someone might steal it.*
- *You**’d better not** tell Elizabeth about the broken glass – she’ll go crazy!*

The question form of *had better* is made by inverting the subject and *had*. This means the same as *should*, but is more formal:

- ***Had I better*** *speak to Joan first before I send this form off? What do you think?*
- ***Had we better*** *leave a note for the delivery guy to take the parcel next door?*

Negative questions with *had better* are more common than affirmative ones:

- ***Hadn’t we better*** *ring the school and tell them Liam is sick?*
- ***Hadn’t you better*** *switch your computer off? It might overheat if you leave it on.*

## Had better or be better, be best?

We use *had better* to give advice in a specific situation. We use the phrase *be better* or *be best +* to-infinitive for more general suggestions:

- *It**’s** always **better to be** safe than sorry.* (‘It’s better to be safe than sorry’ is a saying which means that you should be careful before taking any action.)
- *I think it would **be best to speak** to the people in the video shop to see what they recommend.*

## Had better or would rather, would prefer?

We don’t use *had better* when we talk about preferences. We use *would rather* or *would prefer*.
