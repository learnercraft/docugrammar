# Modality: introduction

Modality is about a speaker’s or a writer’s attitude towards the world. A speaker or writer can express certainty, possibility, willingness, obligation, necessity and ability by using modal words and expressions.

Speakers often have different opinions about the same thing. These speakers are looking at the same thing.

## Modal verbs

Here are the main verbs we use to express modal meanings:

- Core modal verbs: *can*, *could*, *may*, *might*, *will*, *shall*, *would*, *should*, *must*
- Semi-modals: *dare, need*, *ought to*, *used to*

Other verbs with modal meanings: *have (got) to, be going to* and *be able to*
