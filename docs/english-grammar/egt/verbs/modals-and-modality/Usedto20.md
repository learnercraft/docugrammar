# Used to

## Used to: meaning and form

We use *used to* when we refer to things in the past which are no longer true. It can refer to repeated actions or to a state or situation:

- *He **used to** play football for the local team, but he’s too old now.*
- *That white house over there **used to** belong to my family.* (It belonged to my family in the past, but not any more.)

:::warning

In statements, the form *used to* does not change. We do not use the verb *be* before it. It always refers to past time:

- *We **used to** go to the seaside every summer when I was a kid.*
- Not: *~~We are used to go~~ … or ~~We use to go~~ … or ~~We were used to go~~* …

### Negative: didn’t use to

The negative of *used to* is most commonly *didn’t use(d) to*. Sometimes we write it with a final *\-d*, sometimes not. Both forms are common, but many people consider the form with the final *\-d* to be incorrect, and you should not use it in exams:

- *It **didn’t use to** be so crowded in the shops as it is nowadays.*
- *I **didn’t used to** like broccoli when I was younger, but I love it now.* (Don’t use this form in exams.)

In very formal styles, we can use the negative form *used not to*:

- *She **used*** ***not*** ***to** live as poorly as she does now.*

### Questions

The most common form of question is auxiliary *did + use(d) to*. Many people consider the form with a final *\-d* to be incorrect, and you should not use it in exams:

- *I think we met once, a couple of years ago. **Did** you **use** to work with Kevin Harris?*
- ***Didn’t*** *she **used** to live in the same street as us?* (Don’t use this form in written exams.)

### Emphatic did

We can use the emphatic auxiliary *did* with *used to*:

- *We never used to mix very much with the neighbours, but we **did used to** say hello to them in the street.* (Don’t use this form in written exams.)

### Tags

We normally make tags after *used to* with auxiliary *did*:

- *He used to be your boss, **did he**?*
- *We used to love going to the museum, **didn’t we**?*

## Used to or would?

We can use *used to* or *would* to talk about people’s habits in the past. When we use them both together, *used to* most commonly comes first, as it sets the scene for the actions being reported:

- *When we were kids, we **used to** invent amazing games. We **would** imagine we were the government and we **would** make crazy laws that everyone had to obey.*

*Used to*, but not *would*, can describe a state or situation which is no longer true:

- *We **used to** live in Manchester.*
- Not: *~~We would live in Manchester.~~*
- *‘The Townhouse’ **used to** be a Greek restaurant. It’s Italian now.*
- Not: *~~‘The Townhouse’ would be a Greek restaurant~~* …

## Used to or be used to?

*Used to* refers to actions and situations in the past which no longer happen or are no longer true. It always refers to the past:

- *She **used to** sing in a choir, but she gave it up.* (She sang, but she doesn’t sing any more)

*Be used to* means ‘be accustomed to’ or ‘be familiar with’. It can refer to the past, present or future. We follow *be used to* with a noun phrase, a pronoun or the *\-ing* form of a verb:

- *I work in a hospital, so I**’m*** ***used*** ***to** long hours.* (I am accustomed to/familiar with long hours.)
- *She lives in a very small village and hates traffic. She**’s** not **used to** it.*
- *He was a salesman, so he **was used to** travelling up and down the country.* (He was accustomed to/was familiar with travelling.)

We can also say *get used to* or (more formally) *become used to*:

- *University is very different from school, but don’t worry. You’ll soon* ***get*** ***used to it.*** (or, more formally, *You’ll soon become used to it*.)
