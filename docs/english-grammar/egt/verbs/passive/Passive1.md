# Passive

## Passive: active and passive

We use the terms active voice and passive voice to talk about ways of organising the content of a clause:

- *Cambridge University Press **published** this book.* (active)
- *This book **was published** by Cambridge University Press.* (passive)

The active voice is the typical word order. We put the subject (the topic or the theme) first. The subject is the ‘doer’ or agent of the verb:

- ***Edward Barnes*** *designed these houses in the 1880s.* (active)

In the passive, the person or thing that the action was done to becomes the topic or theme. We can leave out the ‘doer’ or agent, or we can place the ‘doer’ in a prepositional phrase (*by* + ‘doer’*):*

- ***These houses*** *were designed in the 1880s.* (passive without agent)
- ***These houses*** *were designed in the 1880s by Edward Barnes.* (passive + *by* + agent)

We use the passive when we want to change the focus of a clause, or if the doer of the verb is not important or not known or if we do not want to say who the doer is.

## Passive: forms

### Be \+ -ed

The most common passive structure is *be* + *\-ed* form:

- *Five million people **watch** the show every week.* (active present simple of *watch*)
- *The show **is watched** by five million people every week.* (passive present simple of *be + -ed* form of *watch*)

The table gives examples of the most common forms in the passive.

### Tenses and the passive

We use passive forms of tenses in the same way as we use their active equivalents. For example, we use the present simple in the passive to talk about general or permanent states, or general facts we think are true at the present time:

- *Mr Lloyd and Mrs James **teach** Geography.* (present simple active)
- *Geography **is taught** by Mr Lloyd and Mrs James.* (present simple passive)

We don’t often use perfect continuous forms (*have/has been being* + -*ed* form) in a passive structure. We usually find a way to reword sentences like this.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>The house </i><b><i>has been being renovated</i></b><i> for almost a year.</i></td><td>not common, we usually avoid this form</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>They </i><b><i>have been renovating</i></b><i> the house for almost a year.</i></td><td>preferred form</td></tr></tbody></table>

- *They*

### Verbs and the passive

We can form passive structures with verbs that are followed by an object (transitive verbs) and some clauses where the verb is followed by a preposition:

- *My favourite mug **was broken**.* (Someone broke my favourite mug.)
- *Their car **was broken into** and the radio **was taken**.* (Someone broke into their car and took their radio.)
- *The holiday **hasn’t been paid*** ***for** yet.* (No one has paid for the holiday yet.)

We can’t make passive forms from verbs which do not have objects (intransitive verbs):

- *The parcel **arrived** in the post this morning.*
- Not: *~~The parcel was arrived~~* …

We don’t usually use the passive with some verbs that describe a state or situation (state verbs):

- *They **were having** lunch.*
- Not: *~~Lunch was being had.~~*

Some verbs are more common in the passive than the active voice. These include *be born, be populated, be stranded, be taken aback*:

- *Where **were** you **born**?*
- *Thousands of passengers **have been stranded** at airports all over Europe after heavy snowfalls.*

### Verbs with two objects

When verbs have two objects, either object can be the theme or subject of the passive structure, depending on what we want to focus on:

- *Her mother **gave** each child a present.* (active)
- *A present **was given** to each child (by her mother).* (passive)
- *Each child **was given** a present (by her mother).* (passive)

### Linking verbs

We don’t form passive structures with verbs like *be, become, seem* where the complement of the verb refers back to the subject (linking verbs):

- *After six years of training she **has** finally **become** a doctor.*

## Passives with an agent

We use the preposition *by* to introduce the doer or the agent of the action. We use this structure when the agent is important:

- *Mr Ward has been arrested **by the FBI**.*
- *The community was destroyed **by a flood** in 1862.*

When the subject of the passive clause is not the real agent of the verb, we use other prepositions in passive structures:

- *I’d been decorating the bedroom and I **was covered*** ***in paint**.* (Paint isn’t the real agent; I am the agent; I was painting.)

When the doer or agent of the action is an instrument, we use *with*:

- *The door **was smashed** open **with a hammer**.*

## Passives without an agent

Passive structures without an agent are very common. We use these structures when an agent is not important, or is unknown or obvious:

- *All applications **must be received** before 31 July.*
- *The data **was analysed** and the results **have** just **been published**.*
- *I walked to work. The car**’s*** ***being*** ***repaired**.*

### It and there

We often use an impersonal expression with *it* or *there* when the agent is not important:

- *It **was decided** to charge £10 per ticket.*
- *It **has been estimated** that in Tanzania one elephant in three is an orphan.*
- *There **were** no comments **given** about the proposal and no decisions **made**.* (No comments were given … no decisions were made.)

- *It*
- *There is*, *there’s* and *there are*

## Passive: uses

Using the passive allows the speaker or writer to make choices about what is important.

We use the passive for different reasons. We sometimes use it to give focus to something. We can also use it because we don’t know the identity of the ‘doer’ or because it’s not important to know who or what did the action. In addition, we use it to be impersonal and create distance.

We often use passives without agents in academic and technical contexts when the process or actions are more significant than who or what did them:

- *A sample **was taken** and **injected** into a tube.*
- *In this study, children’s eye movements **were recorded** while they listened to a series of messages.*

We often use passive forms of reporting verbs (*believe, think, say, consider, find*) to create distance from personal statements and focus more on impersonal processes:

- *Police are looking for a man in his 30s. He **is believed** to be dangerous.*
- *In some cultures blowing your nose in public **is considered** impolite.*

When we want to give emphasis to something new, we can begin with something which is already known and put the newsworthy or important item at the end, where it can be stressed and given focus:

- A: *That’s a lovely chair*.
- B: *Yes, it’s very old. It was given to me* ***by my grandmother***.
- *I was made to feel very welcome **by everyone**.*

## Passive: other forms

Other structures that have passive characteristics are the *get*\-passive and *get/have something done*:

- *The windows **got broken**.* (Someone broke the windows.)
- *He**’s*** ***getting** his hair **coloured**.* (Someone is colouring his hair.)
- *We **had** our wooden floors **painted**.* (Someone painted our wooden floors.)

We use these structures more commonly in speaking. They are similar to the passive because the agent of the action is not the subject.

## Passive: typical errors

We don’t form passive structures with intransitive verbs:

- *She **died**.*
- Not: *~~She was died.~~*

We don’t form passive structures with verbs that describe states:

- *Those shoes **don’t suit** the dress.*
- Not: *~~The dress isn’t suited by those shoes.~~*

We use the past form of *be* + *born* to talk about someone’s birth:

- *She **was born** at home.*
- Not: *~~She is born at home.~~*
