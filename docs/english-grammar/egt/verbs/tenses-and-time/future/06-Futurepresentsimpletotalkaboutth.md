# Future: present simple to talk about the future (I work tomorrow)

The present simple is used to refer to events in the future which are certain because they are facts, or because there is a clear or fixed schedule or timetable:

- *Her birthday **falls** on a Friday next year.* (a known fact about the future)
- *She **has** her driving test next week, does she?* (a fixed arrangement)
- *The train **arrives** at 20.12.* (a timetable)
- *What time **does** their flight to Seoul **leave**?* (a schedule)
