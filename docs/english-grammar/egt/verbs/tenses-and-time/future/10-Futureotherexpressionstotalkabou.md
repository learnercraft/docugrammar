# Future: other expressions to talk about the future

We use a number of expressions with main verb *be* when we refer to the future, especially the immediate future.

## Be about to

We use *be about to* + base form of the verb to refer to things that we expect to happen very soon. We often use it with *just*, for emphasis:

- *The ferry is **about to** leave.*
- *The driver is **about to** collect them. Shall I phone to stop him?*
- *We**’re** just **about to** set off for a walk. Do you want to come?*

:::warning

With time expressions, we don’t use *be about to*, we use the present simple:

- *Hurry up, please! The coach **is about to** leave!*
- *Hurry up, please! The coach **leaves** in five minutes!*
- Not: *~~The coach is about to leave in five minutes!~~*

## Be on the point of

We can also use *be on the point of* + *\-ing* form to refer to things that we expect to happen very soon. *Be on the point of* is similar to *be just about to*:

- *I **was on the point of** leav**ing** my job but then I got promoted so I changed my mind.*

## Be due to

We use *be due to* + base form of the verb to talk about things that are scheduled:

- *The visitors **are due to** arrive at the factory at 10:30.*

## Be to

*Be to* + base form of the verb has a number of meanings. It is rather formal.

### Obligations

*Be to* refers to what someone is obliged or required to do. We also use it to refer to formal decisions:

- \[referring to an obligation\]
- *If I **am not to** tell anyone, then that’s simply not fair.*
- \[making decisions at a business meeting\]
- *So, George **is to** contact the Stockholm office, and Patricia **is to** speak to the Elsico representative. Agreed?*

### Commands and instructions

We can also use *be to* when we give someone commands or instructions:

- *You **are to** report to the head office by 8.30 am.*
- *She**’s not to** be late. OK?*

### Headlines

*Be to* is common in newspaper headlines to refer to events which have been fixed or decided. We don’t always use the verb:

- *Prime Minister **to** announce emergency plan on climate change.* (a headline – used without a verb) (Full form: *The Prime Minister **is to** announce an emergency plan on climate change*.)
