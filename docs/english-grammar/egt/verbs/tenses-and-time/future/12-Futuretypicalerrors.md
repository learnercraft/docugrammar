# Future: typical errors

We don’t use the present continuous when we predict something:

- *You’**re going to** fail the exam unless you attend more classes.*
- Not: *~~You’re failing the exam, unless~~* …

When we make an immediate decision, we use *’ll* not *will* or *shall* or the simple present tense:

- *Wait a minute, I**’ll** lend you my car.*
- Not: … ~~I shall lend you my car~~. or … ~~I lend you my car.~~
