# Future: present continuous to talk about the future (I’m working tomorrow)

The present continuous can refer to the future. It shows that we have already decided something and usually that we have already made a plan or arrangements:

- \[talking about plans for a tour by a rock music group\]
- *The band **is visiting** Denmark next May.*
- *I **am taking** the train to Paris tomorrow.*

:::warning

We don’t use the present continuous when we predict something. Instead, we use *going to* or *will*:

- *It**’s going to** rain again soon.*
- Not: *~~It’s raining again soon.~~*
