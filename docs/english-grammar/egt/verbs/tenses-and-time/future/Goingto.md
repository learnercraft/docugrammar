# Going to

## Going to: present continuous

We use the present continuous form of the verb *go* + preposition *to* + noun phrase to talk about movement in relation to a place or a person in the present:

- *Are you **going to Maggie’s party** tonight?*
- *I’m **going to the shops**. Do you want anything?*

## Going to: future

We can use a present form of *be* + *going to* + the base form of a main verb to talk about the future. We use it for plans and intentions, predictions and commands:

- *I’**m going to buy** a new car next week.* (plan or intention)
- *You’**re** not **going to do** all this in an hour. There’s just too much to do.* (prediction: the speaker can see how much there is to do)
- *I’m telling you, you’re **going to do** it. You don’t have a choice. (command)*

## Was going to

We use a past form of *be + going to* when we talk about a plan we had that may have changed.
