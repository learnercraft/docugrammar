# Past verb forms referring to the present

## Being polite or less direct

We sometimes use a past verb form to talk about present time, in order to be more polite or less direct:

- *I **thought** you might like to know that Linda has been promoted.*
- *We **were hoping** you’d stay for dinner.*
- ***Would*** *you **give** these to Richard, please?* (more polite/less direct than *Will you give these to Richard, please?*)

Conditional and hypothetical structures with *if, what if, wish* and *supposing* often use past forms with a present meaning:

- *If James **was** here now, he’d know what to do.*
- *What if we **left** now instead of later, would we avoid the rush-hour traffic?*
- *I wish I **had** more time. I could stay and help you.*
- *Supposing you **were** married. Where would you be living now, here or somewhere else?*

## Things in the past that are still true

Sometimes we use past verb forms to refer to things which were true or which happened in the past, even when they are still true now:

- A: *That woman at the party last night **was** Russian*.
- B: *I thought so*.
- *He went for an interview for the airforce the other day but he didn’t get in because his eyesight **wasn’t** good enough.*

## It’s time …

We use the expression *it’s time …* to refer to the present moment with a past verb form:

- *It’s eleven-thirty. **It’s time*** ***I*** ***went** to bed.*
- Not: *~~It’s time I go to bed.~~*
