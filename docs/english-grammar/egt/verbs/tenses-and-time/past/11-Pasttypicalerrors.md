# Past: typical errors

We use the past simple, not the past continuous, to talk about past habits:

- *I **walked** to school every day when I was young.*
- Not: *~~I was walking to school every day~~* …

We use the past simple, not the past continuous, to emphasise completed events at a specific time in the past:

- *I **called** her office at 4 o’clock yesterday afternoon.*
- Not: *~~I was calling her office at 4 o’clock yesterday afternoon.~~*

We use the past simple to refer to a definite time in the past, not the present perfect or the past perfect:

- *I **woke up** at seven o’clock this morning.*
- Not: *~~I’ve woken up at seven o’clock this morning.~~*

We use the present perfect, not the past simple, to refer to time up to now:

- *I **haven’t paid** my electricity bill yet.*
- Not: *~~I didn’t pay my electricity bill yet.~~*

We use the past simple, not the past continuous, to refer to repeated main events. We only use the past continuous for repeated background events:

- *He **cycled** to Claire’s house last night.* (main event)
- Not: *~~He was cycling to Claire’s house last night~~*. (We see this as the background event and expect to hear the main event following it.)

We don’t use the past continuous in the same way as *used to* when we refer to things in the past which are no longer true:

- *We **used to have** picnics in the park in the summer.*
- Not: *~~We were having picnics in the park in the summer.~~*

We don’t use the past perfect in the main clause of a conditional sentence. It is only used in the conditional clause:

- *\[conditional clause\] If we **had known** you were alone, \[main clause\] we would have visited you.*
- Not: *~~If we had known you were alone, we had visited you.~~*
