There are a number of spelling rules for when we make the *\-ing* form of the verb.

## Past continuous: uses

### Events happening at a particular time in the past

We generally use the past continuous to talk about actions and states in progress (happening) around a particular time in the past. It can emphasise that the action or state continued for a period of time in the past:

- A: *Where was Donna last night?*
- B: *I’m not sure. I think she **was visiting** her family*. (action)
- *I remember that night. You **were wearing** that red dress.* (state)

- Past continuous or past simple?

### Background events

When one event is more important than another in the past, we can use the past continuous for the background event (the less important event) and the past simple for the main event:

- *\[background event\] Lisa **was cycling** to school when \[main event\] **she*** ***saw** the accident.*
- *\[background event\] What **were** you **thinking*** ***about** when \[main event\] you **won** the race?*

- Past continuous or past simple?

### Reasons and contexts for events

We often use the past continuous to give a reason or context for an event:

- A: *I can’t believe you met Fran and Dave in Portugal*.
- B: *It was funny. They **were staying** in the hotel next to ours*. (giving a reason/context for meeting them)
- *I didn’t make the meeting last week; I **was travelling** to Rome.*

### Ongoing and repeated events

We can use the past continuous to talk about repeated background events in the past. It can suggest that the situation was temporary or subject to change:

- *She **was feeding** her neighbours’ cat every morning while they were on holiday. Then one morning, it was gone.*
- *The neighbours **were making** so much noise, night after night. We had to complain eventually.*

:::warning

We only use the past continuous for repeated background events. If they are repeated main events, we use the past simple:

- *I **phoned** you four times last night. Where were you?*
- Not: *~~I was phoning you four times last night.~~*

:::

We don’t use the past continuous in the same way as *used to* when we talk about things in the past which are no longer true:

- *We **used to** go on holiday to Yorkshire every year when I was little.*
- Not: *~~We were going on holiday~~* …

- *Used to*

:::

Adverbs such as *always, constantly, forever* are used with the past continuous when we talk about repeated, unplanned or undesired events:

- *We **were*** ***always*** ***spending** so much time in traffic. That’s the main reason why we decided to move to the country and work from home.*
- *My boss **was*** ***constantly phoning** me in my last job. I hated it.*
- *She **was forever losing** her keys.*

### The past continuous and definite time

We sometimes use the past continuous to refer to a definite period of past time. This usually emphasises the event continuing over a period of time:

- *We **were cooking** all morning because we had 15 people coming for lunch.*
- *Lots of us **were working** at the office on Saturday because we had to finish the project by Monday.*
