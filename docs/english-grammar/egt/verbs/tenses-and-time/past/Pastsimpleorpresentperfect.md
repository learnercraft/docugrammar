# Past simple or present perfect?

Past simple = *I worked* Present perfect = *I have worked*

## Definite time in the past

We use the past simple to refer to definite time in the past (when we specify the time or how long) and usually with past time expressions such as *yesterday*, *two weeks ago, last year, in 1995*:

- *We **met** in January 1975. We **went** to America together in 1978.*
- Not: *~~We have met in January 1975. We have gone to America together in 1978.~~*

## Time up to now

We use the present perfect to talk about time up to now, that is, events that took place in the past but which connect with the present. The present perfect is often used with time expressions which indicate time up to now, for example *today, this year, in the last six months*:

- *I **haven’t seen** her since January 1995.*
- Not: *~~I didn’t see her since January 1995.~~*
