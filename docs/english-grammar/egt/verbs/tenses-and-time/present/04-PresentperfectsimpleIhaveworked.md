## Present perfect simple: uses

We use the present perfect simple to refer to events in the past but which connect to the present.

### Experiences

We use the present perfect simple to talk about our experiences up to now. The time of the experiences is not important:

- \[talking about musical theatre productions\]
- *And I**’ve******seen** ‘Buddy’ and I**’ve*** ***seen** ‘Starlight Express’ in London. And I want to see ‘Phantom of the Opera’ next.*
- *We’re going to Wagamama’s for dinner tonight. I**’ve*** ***been** there a couple of times before.*

Although we do not give a specific time, we often use general time expressions like *ever, never, before, in my life, so far, up until now* with this use of the present perfect simple:

- *We **haven’t met*** ***before**, have we?*
- *They**’ve*** ***sold** 110 **so far**.* (*so far* = from a point in the past up until now)

We often use *ever, not … ever* and *never* when we talk about experiences:

- *It was the worst performance we **have*** ***ever*** ***seen**.*
- ***Have*** *you **ever*** ***tried** to write your name and address with your left hand?*
- *She**’s*** ***never*** ***said** sorry for what she did.*

We often use the present perfect simple for a unique experience when we are using a superlative:

- *I felt **the happiest** I **have** ever **felt**. My first Olympic final; the bronze medal; European record of 9.97 seconds.*
- *The dome of the Blue Mosque at Isfahan is **the most beautiful building** I **have** ever **seen**.*
- *It was **the best decision** I **have** ever **made** in my life.*
- *It’s **the worst*** ***sports programme** I **have** ever **seen** and the first I **have** ever **turned** off.*

We usually use the present perfect simple with *the first time* when we’re talking about an immediate, continuing or recent event:

- *That’s **the first time** I**’ve*** ***seen** you get angry.*

### Recent completed events

We use the present perfect simple to talk about a finished event or state in the very recent past. We do not give a specific time. We often use words like *just* or *recently* for events taking place a very short time before now:

- *What’s this? What**’s*** ***just*** ***happened**?*
- *The company employs around 400 staff and **has*** ***recently*** ***opened** an office in the UK.*
- *Niki and John **have*** ***just*** ***come** back from a week in Spain.*

### Past events, present results

We use the present perfect simple when a single past action has a connection with the present:

- *She**’s*** ***broken** her arm in two places.* (Her arm is still broken now.)
- *Why **haven’t** you **dressed** in something warmer?* (You got dressed in the past but the clothes are not warm enough for now.)
- *A fire **has broken out** at a disused hotel on the seafront.* (The fire is burning now; it’s a recent event too.)
- *Your flowers **haven’t arrived**.* (Your flowers are not here; they were supposed to arrive in the past.)

### Time + for and since

We use the present perfect simple with *for* and *since* to talk about a present situation that began at a specific point in the past and is still going on in the present. We are looking back from the present to a point in the past.

(speaking in 2011)</td></tr></tbody></table>

### How long …?

We often use expressions with *for* and *since* to answer the question *How long …+* present perfect simple. We use the *How long …?* question to ask about the duration of a state or activity:

- A: ***How long have*** *you **worked** there?*
- B: ***Since*** *21 August. So **for** about four months*.

### Yet

We use *yet* + the present perfect simple, mainly in questions and negative statements, to refer to things we intend to do in the future but which are not done:

- *Don’t wash up that cup. I **haven’t*** ***finished** my coffee **yet**.* (I intend to finish it.)
- ***Haven’t*** *you **done** your homework **yet**?* (You intend to do it.)

### Already

We use *already* + the present perfect simple when we want to emphasise that something is done or achieved, often before the expected time:

- *I**’ve*** ***already*** ***booked** my flight home.*
- A: *Will you go and clean your teeth!*
- B: *I**’ve*** ***already*** ***cleaned** them*.

### Still

- *She **still*** ***hasn’t said** sorry to me.*
- *I feel really tired. I **still*** ***haven’t recovered** from the jet lag.*

### Introducing past time events

The present perfect simple is often used in newspaper headlines or TV news programmes to report a recent past event. It is then followed by a series of verbs in the past simple (underlined):

- *Charlton Heston **has died** aged 84, a spokesman for his family **has said**. Heston* died *on Saturday at his home in Beverly Hills. His wife Lydia, whom he* married *in 1944, was at his side. Heston* won *a best actor Oscar for his starring role in the epic ‘Ben Hur’.*

We can also use the present perfect simple to introduce an ‘open’ general point about something. We can then use the past simple (underlined) to give more detailed specific information:

- ***Have*** *you **seen** any Arthur Miller plays? I* saw *a fantastic production of ‘The Crucible’.*

### American English

In American English the past simple is often used instead of the present perfect simple, often with *already* and *yet*.
