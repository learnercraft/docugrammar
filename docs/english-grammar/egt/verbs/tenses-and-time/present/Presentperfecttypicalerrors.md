# Present perfect: typical errors

We don’t use *since* with periods of time:

- *I**’ve*** ***lived** here **for** most of my life.*
- Not: … ~~since most of my life.~~

We don’t use the present simple or the present continuous when we talk about ‘time up to now’. We use the present perfect:

- *They**’ve*** ***known** each other since January.*
- Not: *~~They know each other since January.~~*
- Not: *~~They’re knowing each other since January.~~*

We usually use the present perfect simple with *the first time* when we’re talking about an immediate, continuing or recent event:

- *Was that the first time you**’ve*** ***played** that song?*
- Not: *~~Was that the first time you play that song?~~*

- *Ever*
- *Never* or *not … ever*?
