# Would like

We use *would like or **’**d like* to say politely what we want, especially when making offers and requests:

- ***Would*** *you **like** a biscuit with your coffee?*
- *Can you order for Ellie? She**’d*** ***like** the Margarita pizza, please.*

Verbs that follow *would like* are in the *to*\-infinitive form:

- ***Would*** *you **like** to listen to that again?*
- *I**’d*** ***like** to get a return ticket for tomorrow.*

We use *Do you like …?* to ask about preferences in general. We don’t use *Do you like …?* to make offers or requests.

## Would like to have \+ \-ed form

We use *would like to have* + *\-ed* form when talking about things in the past that we have missed:

- ***I’d like to have*** ***watched*** *the football but I had to go out.* (I wanted to watch the football, but I didn’t.)

## I’d like to

We can use *I’d like to* as a short answer to an offer or invitation:

- A: *You must have dinner with us*.
- B: *Yes*, ***I’d like to***.
- A: *Good. Is Sunday night any good?*
