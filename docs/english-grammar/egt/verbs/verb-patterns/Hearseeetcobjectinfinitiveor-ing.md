# Hear, see, etc. + object + infinitive or -ing

We can use either the infinitive without *to* or the -*ing* form after the object of verbs such as *hear, see, notice, watch*. The infinitive without *to* often emphasises the whole action or event which someone hears or sees. The -*ing* form usually emphasises an action or event which is in progress or not yet completed.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>He </i><b><i>saw</i></b><i> her </i><b><i>drive</i></b><i> off with a young man in the passenger seat.</i></td><td>The speaker observed the whole event.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Maria </i><b><i>heard</i></b><i> him </i><b><i>coming</i></b><i> up the stairs towards her room, and felt scared.</i></td><td>The action was in progress, happening, but not completed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

The -*ing* form can also emphasise that an action or event is repeated:

- *We **watched** them **running** back and forth, **loading** and **unloading** the trucks and **taking** boxes in and out of the building.*

After *can* or *could* with one of these verbs, we always use the *\-ing* form, not the infinitive:

- *I **can hear** people **talking**. They must be in the next room.*
- Not: *~~I can hear people to talk.~~*

## Typical errors

We don’t use *to* with the infinitive form after the object:

- *She **heard** the doorbell **ring** and went to answer it.*
- Not: *~~She heard the doorbell to ring~~* …

We don’t use a finite verb form after the object:

- *I **watched** the woman **come** out of the house and* ***get into a car.***
- Not: *~~I watched the woman came out of the house and got into a car.~~*
