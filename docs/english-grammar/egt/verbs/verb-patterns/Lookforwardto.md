# Look forward to

*Look forward to* something means to be pleased or excited that it is going to happen. The ‘to’ in *look forward to* is a preposition, so we must follow it by a noun phrase or a verb in the -*ing* form:

- *I’m **looking forward to** the holidays.*
- A: *Are you excited about your trip to South America?*
- B: *Yes, I’m **looking forward to** it*.
- *We’re **looking forward to** going to Switzerland next month.*
- Not: … ~~looking forward to go to Switzerland~~ …

If the second verb has a different subject, we use the object form of the pronoun, not the subject form:

- *We’re **looking forward to** him arriving next week.*
- Not: *~~We’re looking forward to he arriving next week.~~*

We also use *look forward to* at the end of formal letters and formal emails to say that we hope to hear from someone or expect that something will happen. We use the present simple form:

- *I **look forward to** your reply.*
- *I **look forward to** hearing from you soon.*
- *We **look forward to** receiving payment for the services detailed above.*
