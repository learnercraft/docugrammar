# Stop + -ing form or to-infinitive

We use the -*ing* form after *stop* to indicate that an action or event is no longer continuing:

- *It’s **stopped** rain**ing**. Let’s go for a walk.* (It was raining, but not any more.)
- *We’ve **stopped** us**ing** plastic bags in supermarkets. We take our own bag with us now when we go shopping.*

We use the *to-*infinitive after *stop* to indicate that someone stops doing something in order to do something else:

- *On the way to Edinburgh, we **stopped*** ***to*** ***look** at an old castle.* (We were travelling, then we stopped our journey in order to look at the castle.)
- *We **stopped to have** something to eat.*
