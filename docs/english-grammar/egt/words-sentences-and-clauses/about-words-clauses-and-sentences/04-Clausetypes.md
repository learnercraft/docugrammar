# Clause types

There are four basic types of main clause: declaratives (statements), interrogatives (questions), imperatives (orders/instructions) and exclamatives (used for exclamations).

In the examples below, x is any other element in the clause (e.g. object, predicative complement):

## Declarative clauses

Declarative clauses most commonly function as statements. The usual word order is subject (s) + verb (v) + x. Declaratives can be affirmative or negative. They make statements about how things are and how they are not.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>affirmative</td><td>negative</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>[S] I [V] saw [X] them last week.</i></td><td><i>[S] I [V] didn’t see [X] them last week.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>[S] Some courses [V] begin [X] in January.</i></td><td><i>[S] Some courses [V] don’t begin [X] until March.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

Sometimes we use declaratives as questions or requests:

- A: ***Those are the only tickets left?*** (question)
- B: *Yes, just those two*.
- A: ***You could pass me the spoon***. *That would be helpful*. (request)
- B: *This one?*

## Interrogative clauses

Interrogative clauses most commonly function as questions. The usual word order is (*wh*\-word) + auxiliary/modal verb (aux/m) + subject + verb + x:

- *What \[AUX\] are \[S\] you \[V\] doing?*
- *\[AUX\] Does \[S\] she \[V\] play \[X\] tennis well?*
- *\[M\] Can \[S\] I \[V\] come \[X\] with you?*

Interrogative clauses can be affirmative or negative.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>affirmative</td><td>negative</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Are there any blue ones?</i></td><td><i>Aren’t there any blue ones?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Why did he tell me?</i></td><td><i>Why didn’t he tell me?</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Imperative clauses

Imperative clauses most commonly function as commands, instructions or orders. The usual word order is verb + x. We do not usually include the subject in an imperative clause. We use the base form of the verb:

- *Come on. Hurry up!*
- *Leave me alone!*
- *Let’s go.*
- *Put it in the microwave for two minutes.*

Imperative clauses can be affirmative or negative. We make negative imperatives with auxiliary verb *do + not*. The contracted form *don’t* is very common in speaking:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>affirmative</td><td>negative</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Go!</i></td><td><i>Don’t go!</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Leave the door open.</i></td><td><i>Don’t leave the door open.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Be happy.</i></td><td><i>Don’t be sad.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

We use *do not* in more formal contexts:

- \[instructions on a jar of coffee\]
- ***Do not*** *make coffee with boiling water.*

We can use the short form *don’t* as an imperative answer, or as a reaction to something:

- A: *Shall I open the window?*
- B: *No*, ***don’t***. *I’m freezing*. (No, don’t open the window.)

### Imperatives with subject pronoun

Sometimes we use *you* (subject pronoun) with an imperative clause to make a command stronger or to strengthen a contrast. It can sometimes sound impolite:

- *Don’t **you** ever read my letters again.*
- \[talking about washing up dishes\]
- ***You*** *wash, I’ll dry.*

In informal speaking, we can use an indefinite subject (e.g. *someone*, *somebody*, *no one*, *nobody*, *everyone*, *everybody*) with an imperative:

- ***No one*** *move. **Everyone** stay still.*

### Invitations

We often use an imperative to make an offer or invitation:

- ***Have*** *some more cake. There’s plenty there.*

### Imperatives with do

We sometimes use *do* for emphasis in an imperative clause, especially if we want to be very polite:

- ***Do*** *sit down, please.*

### Imperatives with let

Spoken English:

In speaking we usually use *let’s* for first person plural imperatives (*us*) to make a suggestion. In more formal situations we use *let us*:

- ***Let’s*** *go and eat.*
- *Now, **let us** all get some sleep.* (more formal)

For third person imperatives (*him, her, it, them*) we form an imperative clause with *let*:

- A: *Mr Thomas is here to see you. Shall I send him in?*
- B: ***Let him*** *wait. I’m busy*.

## Exclamative clauses

Exclamative clauses usually have one of the following word orders:

*What* + noun + subject + verb

*How* + adjective or adverb + subject + verb

Auxiliary or modal verb + subject + verb (i.e. interrogative word order)

We use exclamative clauses most commonly to express surprise or shock. In writing we use an exclamation mark:

- *What a lovely sister you are!*
- *How beautiful that house was!*
- *Wasn’t she great!*
- *Didn’t he sing well!*
