# Dummy subjects

English clauses which are not imperatives must have a subject. Sometimes we need to use a ‘dummy’ or ‘empty’ or ‘artificial’ subject when there is no subject attached to the verb, and where the real subject is somewhere else in the clause. *It* and *there* are the two dummy subjects used in English:

- ***It****’s always interesting **to find out about your family history**.*
- *\[real subject\] **To find out about your family history** is always interesting.*
- (The real subject – the thing that is interesting – is ‘to find out about your family history’.)

- ***There*** *are **five Dutch people in our village**.*
- (The real subject is the Dutch people – they are in the village.)

## It as a dummy subject

We often use *it* as a dummy subject with adjectives and their complements:

- ***It****’s important to wear a helmet whenever you do any dangerous sport.*
- *\[real subject\] **Wearing a helmet when you do any dangerous sport** is important.*
- Not: Is important to wear a helmet …
- (The real subject is ‘wearing a helmet when you do any dangerous sport’ – that is what is important.)

- ***It’****s useful to write down your passport number somewhere, in case you lose it.*

## There as a dummy subject

*There* operates as a dummy subject in the construction *there is* or *there are*. *There is/are* indicates that something or someone exists or is in a particular place or situation:

- ***There****’s a woman waiting outside who wants to talk to you.*
- (The real subject is the woman – she is waiting outside.).
- Not: *~~Is a woman waiting outside~~ … or ~~It’s a woman waiting outside~~*…

- ***There*** *are two shops in the village.*
- Not: Are two shops … or They are two shops…
