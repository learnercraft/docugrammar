# Sentences

A sentence is a unit of grammar. Typically, in writing, it begins with a capital letter and ends with a full stop.

## Sentence structures

There are three types of sentence structures: simple, compound and complex.

### Simple sentences

Simple sentences have only one main clause:

- ***We’re going on holiday tomorrow****.* (one main clause)
- ***I’m not keen on musicals****.*

### Compound sentences

Compound sentences have two or more main clauses, joined by a coordinating conjunction:

- ***I phoned her*** *but **she wasn’t there**.*
- ***Are you coming*** *or **are you staying at home** or **will you go and see Mum**?*

### Complex sentences

Complex sentences have a main clause and one or more subordinate clauses, introduced by a subordinating conjunction (The main clause is in bold; the subordinate clause is underlined.):

- ***You can call me*** if you have any problems*.*
- ***I got up earlier than usual*** because I had to get the 6.30 train*.*
- Although it hurt when she bent her wrist*, **she could still move her fingers**.*

## Types of sentence

There are four main types of clause or sentence.

(s = subject; v = verb; aux = auxiliary verb; x = objects, complements or adjuncts)
