# Subject–verb agreement

The person and number of the subject of the clause determine the person and number of the verb of the clause. This is called subject–verb agreement or concord:

- ***He*** ***hates*** *being in hospital.* (third person singular subject + *hates*)
- Not: *~~He hate being~~* …
- ***We*** *often **go** to Edinburgh.*
- Not: *~~We often goes~~* …
- ***Are*** ***you*** *ready?*
- Not: *~~Is you ready?~~*
- ***They*** ***don’t*** *do enough art at school.*
- Not: *~~They doesn’t do~~* …

Some nouns, describing groups of people, can take a singular or plural verb:

- ***The audience*** ***was*** *silent, waiting.* (or ***The audience*** ***were*** *silent …*)
- ***The government does not*** *encourage investment in industry.* (or ***The government do not*** *encourage …*)
