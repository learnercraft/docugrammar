# Word classes and phrase classes

## Major word classes

English has four major word classes: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. They have many thousands of members, and new nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are often created. Nouns are the most common type of word, followed by verbs. Adjectives are less common and adverbs are even less common.

Many words belong to more than one word class. For example, *book* can be used as a noun or as a verb; *fast* can be used as an adjective or an adverb:

- *It’s an interesting **book**.* (noun)
- *We ought to **book** a holiday soon.* (verb)
- *He loves **fast** cars.* (adjective)
- *Don’t drive so **fast**!* (adverb)

### Typical word-class suffixes

A suffix can often, but not always, tell us if a word is a noun, verb, adjective or adverb:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>nouns</td><td>verbs</td><td>adjectives</td><td>adverbs</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>station</i><i>government</i><i>cruelty</i></td><td><i>soften</i><i>identify</i><i>industrialise</i></td><td><i>drinkable</i><i>Japanese</i><i>useless</i></td><td><i>carefully</i><i>easily</i><i>sadly</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

A good learner’s dictionary will tell you what class or classes a word belongs to.

## Other word classes

The other word classes include prepositions, pronouns, determiners, conjunctions and interjections.

### Prepositions

Prepositions describe the relationship between words from the major word classes. They include words such as *at, in, on, across, behind, for*:

- *We went **to** the top **of** the mountain.*
- (*to* describes the relationship between *went* and *top*; *of* describes the relationship between *top* and *mountain*)

- *Are you ready **for** lunch yet?*
- (*for* describes the relationship between *ready* and *lunch*)

### Pronouns

Pronouns are words which substitute for noun phrases, so that we do not need to say the whole noun phrase or repeat it unnecessarily. Pronouns include words such as *you, it, we, mine, ours, theirs, someone, anyone, one, this, those*:

- ***That****’s Gerry in the photo. **He** lives in Barcelona.*
- *This jacket’s **mine**. **That** must be Linda’s.*

### Determiners

Determiners come before nouns. They show what type of reference the noun is making. They include words such as *a/an, the, my, his, some, this, both*:

- *Have you got **a** ruler I can borrow?*
- *I need **some** paper for **my** printer.*
- ***This*** *phone isn’t easy to use.*

### Conjunctions

Conjunctions show a link between one word, phrase or clause and another word, phrase or clause. They include *and, but, when, if, because*:

- *Joe **and** Dan are brothers.*
- *It was okay, **but** I wouldn’t recommend it as a restaurant.*
- *We’ll ring you **when** we get to London.*

### Interjections

Interjections are mostly exclamation words (e.g. *gosh! wow! oh!*), which show people’s reactions to events and situations:

- A: *I’m giving up my job*.
- B: ***Oh***.
- ***Yippee****! I don’t have to go to work tomorrow!*
- ***Gosh****! What an awful smell!*

- Discourse markers (*so, right, okay*)

## Phrase classes

The different word classes can form the basis of phrases. When they do this, they operate as the head of the phrase. So, a noun operates as the head of a noun phrase, a verb as the head of a verb phrase, and so on. Heads of phrases (H) can have words before them (e.g. determiners (det), adjectives (adj), adverbs (adv)) or after them (e.g. postmodifiers (pm) or complements (c)):

### Noun phrase (underlined)

- *\[DET\]* That *\[ADJ\]* old *\[H\]* box *\[PM (clause)\]* you left in the kitchen *has got a hole in it.*
- *(*That old box you left in the kitchen *has got a hole in it.)*

### Adverb phrase (underlined)

- *It all happened \[ADJ\]* very *\[H\]* suddenly*.*
- (*It all happened* very suddenly*.*)

### Prepositional phrase (underlined)

- *\[H\] The President \[C\]* of the United States *arrives tomorrow.*
- *(The President* of the United States *arrives tomorrow.)*
