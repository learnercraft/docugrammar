# Subjects

A subject is one of the five major elements of clause structure. The other four are: verb, object, complement and adjunct. Subjects are essential in declarative, negative and interrogative clauses.

The subject acts as the ‘doer’ or agent of an action. Subjects are typically noun phrases (e.g. a noun or pronoun and any dependent words before or after it):

- ***The teacher*** *told the class to sit down.* (determiner + noun)
- *Doesn’t **he** eat meat?* (pronoun)
- ***Spring*** *is like a breath of fresh air after a winter indoors.* (noun)
- ***Callum*** *is so good at sport.* (proper noun)
- ***They*** *don’t open the shop on Sundays.* (pronoun)
- ***Surfing*** *is becoming more and more popular.* (-*ing* form as a noun)
- ***Examples of the work of the four artists*** *will be in an exhibition at the Tate Gallery from Nov 4–29.* (noun + prepositional phrase)

## Subject position

In statements (declarative clauses), the subject comes before the verb:

- \[*eating out* means eating in a restaurant\]
- ***They*** *love eating out.*
- ***Some people*** *prefer to go on holiday to the same place every year.*
- ***The course fee*** *doesn’t include materials.*

In questions (interrogative clauses), the subject comes after the auxiliary or modal verb and before the main verb:

- *Has **Shona** been to the house before?* (auxiliary + subject + verb + other elements)
- *Do **you** want a cup of tea?* (auxiliary + subject + verb + other elements)

In exclamations, the subject comes after *How* or *What* and before the verb:

- *What a fantastic cook **she** is!*
- *How easily **he**’d tricked her!*

## Dummy subjects

The subject is an essential part of a clause. Sometimes we need to use a ‘dummy’ subject where there is no other subject to put in the subject position. We use *it* or *there* as subjects:

- ***It****’s not raining, is **it**?*
- ***It****’s strange the way the weather changes so quickly.*
- ***There*** *are lots of things to do here in the city centre.*

## No subject

Spoken English:

In very informal speaking we can leave out the pronoun in declarative clauses (statements), particularly *I* with verbs like *hope* and *know*:

- *Hope you have a great time.* (I hope you have …)
- A: *Do we have to do the second exercise as well?*
- B: *Don’t think so*. (I don’t think so.)

In imperative clauses (orders, instructions, requests) we don’t include the subject:

- *Close the door after you.*
- *Turn left at the end of the road.*

## Subjects: typical errors

We don’t omit the subject in declarative and interrogative clauses:

- A: *Do **you** know Susie?*
- B: *Yes*, ***I*** *do*. ***She****’s really nice*.
- Not: *~~Is really nice~~*.

- ***It****’s strange that we don’t see them any more.*
- Not: *~~Is strange that~~* …

- *Are **there** two phone boxes at the end of this road?*
- Not: *~~Are two phone boxes at the end of this road?~~*
