# As if and as though

*As if* and *as though* are conjunctions.

We use *as if* and *as though* to make comparisons. They have a similar meaning. We use *as if* and *as though* to talk about an imaginary situation or a situation that may not be true but that is likely or possible. *As if* is more common than *as though*:

- *The floods were rising and it was **as if** it was the end of the world.*
- *It looks **as if** they’ve had a shock.*
- *It looks **as though** you’ve not met before.*

We can use both *as if* and *as though* followed by a non-finite clause or a prepositional phrase:

- *She moved her lips **as if** to smile.*
- *They were shouting **as though** in panic.*

*As if* and *as though* commonly follow the verbs *feel* and *look*:

- *She felt **as if** all her worries had gone.*
- *They felt **as though** they had been given the wrong information.*
- *I’ve got so much work it looks **as if** I’ll have to stay at home this evening.*

In informal English, *like* can be used in a similar way to *as if*, though it is not always considered correct in formal contexts:

- *It felt **like** it could snow at any minute.*
