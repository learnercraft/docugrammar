# As

*As* is a preposition or a conjunction.

## As as a preposition

We use *as* with a noun to refer to the role or purpose of a person or thing:

- *I worked **as** a waiter when I was a student. Most of us did.*
- Not: *~~I worked like a waiter …~~*

- \[The *Daily Telegraph* is a British newspaper\]
- *The Daily Telegraph appointed Trevor Grove **as** its Sunday editor.*

- *Internet shopping is seen **as** a cheaper alternative to shopping on the high street.*
- *A sarong is essential holiday gear. It can be used **as** a beach towel, wrap, dress or scarf and will take up no space in your bag.*

:::warning

We don’t use *as* + noun to mean ‘similar to’. We use *like* + noun:

- *It’s almost **like** a real beach, but it’s actually artificial.*
- Not: *~~It’s almost as a real beach …~~*
- *I would like to have a white cat **like** the one in my dream.*
- Not: … ~~as the one in my dream~~

- *Like*

## As as a conjunction

The conjunction *as* has several different meanings. We use *as* when one event happens while another is in progress (‘during the time that’). In this case the verb after is often in the continuous form:

- *They arrived **as** we were leaving.* (time conjunction meaning ‘while’ or ‘when’)

:::

We use *as* to connect a result with a cause:

- *I went to bed at 9 pm **as** I had a plane to catch at 6 am.* (reason and result meaning ‘because’)

We also use *as* to mean ‘in the way that’:

- ***As*** *the forecast predicted, the weather was dreadful for the whole of the weekend.*
- *She arrived early, **as** I expected.*

## The same as

We use *as* with *the same* to talk about identical things:

- *Your jacket is **the same** colour **as** mine.*

:::note[See also]

- *Same, similar, identical*

:::

## As: simultaneous changes

We use *as* to introduce two events happening at the same time. After *as* with this meaning, we usually use a simple (rather than continuous) form of the verb:

- ***As*** *the show increases in popularity, more and more tickets are sold daily.*

:::warning

We don’t use *as* alone to introduce examples. We say *such as*:

- *They gave them gifts **such as** flowers and fruit and sang a special welcome song.*
- Not: … ~~gifts as flowers~~ …
