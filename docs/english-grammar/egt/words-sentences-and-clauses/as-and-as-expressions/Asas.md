# As … as

We use *as +* adjective/adverb *\+ as* to make comparisons when the things we are comparing are equal in some way:

- *The world’s biggest bull is **as big as** a small elephant.*
- *The weather this summer is **as bad as** last year. It hasn’t stopped raining for weeks.*
- *You have to unwrap it **as carefully as** you can. It’s quite fragile.*

## Not as … as

We use *not as … as* to make comparisons between things which aren’t equal:

- *She’s **not** singing **as loudly as** she can.*

We can modify *not* *as … as* by using *not quite as* or *not nearly as*:

- (The second race was easy but the first one was easier.)
- *These new shoes are **not nearly as comfortable as** my old ones.*

We can also use *not so … as. Not so … as* is less common than *not as … as*:

We often use expressions of possibility or ability after *as … as*:

- *Can you come **as soon as possible**?*
- *Go to **as many places as you can**.*

## As much as, as many as

When we want to make comparisons referring to quantity, we use *as much as* with uncountable nouns and *as many as* with plural nouns:

- *Greg makes **as much money as** Mick but **not as much as** Neil.*
- *They try to give them **as much freedom as** they can.*
- *There weren’t **as many people** there **as** I expected.*

We can use *as much as* and *as many as* before a number to refer to a large number of something:
