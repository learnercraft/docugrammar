# As long as and so long as

*As long as* and *so long as* are conjunctions.

## As long as

We use *as long as* to refer to the intended duration of a plan or idea, most commonly referring to the future. We always use the present simple to refer to the future after *as long as*:

- *We are very happy for you to stay at our house **as long as** you like.*
- *I’ll remember that film **as long as** I live.*
- Not: … ~~as long as I will live~~.

## As long as and so long as

*As long as* or *so long as* also means ‘provided that’, ‘providing that’ or ‘on condition that’:

- *You are allowed to go **as long as** you let us know when you arrive.*

*So long as* is a little more informal:

- *You can borrow the car **so long as** you don’t drive too fast.*
