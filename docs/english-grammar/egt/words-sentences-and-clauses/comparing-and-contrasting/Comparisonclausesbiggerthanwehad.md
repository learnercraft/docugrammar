# Comparison: clauses (bigger than we had imagined)

The second part of a comparison (underlined) is often a clause:

- *The price was* ***higher*** than we had expected*.*
- *That restaurant is* ***not as good*** as it used to be*.*
- *It was **the best** nature documentary* I’ve ever seen*.*

## Than-clauses

We can use *than* to introduce a clause after a comparative adjective, adverb or noun phrase. The clause (underlined) is usually a reduced clause (a clause with ellipsis) or one with a substitute verb *do*:

- *The house was* ***bigger*** than we had imagined*.*
- (… bigger than we had imagined it was)

- *The journey took* ***longer*** than expected*.*
- (… longer than people expected it to take)

- *He finished the second part* ***more quickly*** than he did the first part*.*
- (… more quickly than he finished the first part.)

- *He always spent* ***more money*** than George did*.*
- (… more money than George spent.)

:::warning

We use *than*, not *that* or *as*, to introduce a clause after a comparative adjective or adverb:

- *We finished the job quicker **than** we had expected.*
- Not: … ~~quicker that we had expected.~~ or … ~~quicker as we had expected.~~

## That\-clauses

We can use a *that*\-clause after a superlative:

- *Until 2005, the film had made the most money **that any British film had ever made**.*

In informal situations, we can omit *that*:

- *It was the biggest fire **(that) anyone had ever seen**.*
- *It was the least expensive restaurant **(that) we ate at**, but the food was excellent.*
