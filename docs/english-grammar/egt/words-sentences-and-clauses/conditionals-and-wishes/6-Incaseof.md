# In case (of)

*In case* is a conjunction or adverb. *In case of* is a preposition.

## In case

We use *in case* to talk about things we should do in order to be prepared for possible future situations:

- *Shall I keep some chicken salad for your brother **in case** he’s hungry when he gets here?* (conjunction)
- ***In case*** *I forget later, here are the keys to the garage.* (conjunction)
- *She knows she’s passed the oral exam, but she doesn’t want to say anything just **in case**.* (adverb)

We don’t use *in case* to mean ‘if’.

- *I’ll take cash* ***in case we need it on the ferry.*** (we don’t know if we will need cash on the ferry)

## In case of

We use *in case of* + noun to mean ‘if and when something happens’:

- \[notice in a lift\]
- ***In case of*** *breakdown, please press the alarm button and call this number.* (if and when the lift breaks down, …)
