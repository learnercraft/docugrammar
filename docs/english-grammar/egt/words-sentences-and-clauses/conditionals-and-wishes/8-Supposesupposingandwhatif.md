# Suppose, supposing and what if

## Suggestions

We use *suppose, supposing* and *what if* + present verb form to make suggestions about what might happen:

- A: *What time shall we meet?*
- B: ***Suppose*** *we meet in the offices downstairs at four o’clock?*
- A: *That’s perfect. I’ll let the others know*.

- ***Supposing*** *I don’t bring my car and you and I travel together. That would save us half the cost of petrol and parking.*
- A: *The electricity has gone. There must be a power cut*.
- B: ***What if*** *we find the candles and put them around the room?*
- A: *Okay. Good idea. Do you know where they are?*

## Possibility

When we are less certain, we use *suppose, supposing* and *what if* + past form to talk about future possibility:

- ***Suppose*** *we asked Mary to baby-sit? Do you think she’d do it?* (not as certain as *Suppose we ask Mary to baby-sit?*)
- ***Supposing*** *someone else wrote the essay. How would we know?* (not as certain as *Supposing someone else writes the essay …*)
- A: ***What if*** *I gave up working full-time. I’d love that*.
- B: *You’re joking surely!!*

When we refer to something that did not happen (something hypothetical), we use the past perfect:

- ***Suppose*** *we hadn’t brought our umbrellas.* (We did bring our umbrellas.)
- ***Supposing*** *they had closed the road. Would that have been a good idea?* (They didn’t close the road.)
- ***What if*** *I **had** accidentally told Maria about the party! That would have ruined the surprise.* (I didn’t tell Maria about the party.)

:::warning

We use *be supposed to* to talk about obligations and arrangements, not suggestions.

- *You **are supposed to** put money in the parking meter!*
