# Conditionals: typical errors

We don’t use *will* and *would* in the conditional clause:

- *If you **book** before April 30th, you will receive a 20% discount.*
- Not: *~~If you will book before April 30th, you will receive a 20% discount.~~*

- *If we **had** a bigger flat, we could invite friends to come and stay.*
- Not: *~~If we would have a bigger flat, we could invite friends to come and stay.~~*

- *If the weather **hadn’t been** so bad, I could have gone to meet them.*
- Not: *~~If the weather would not have been so bad, I could have gone to meet them.~~*

We don’t use *shall* or *will* in the main clause in second conditional sentences:

- *If you worked harder, you **would** earn more money.*
- Not: … ~~you will earn more money.~~

We don’t use *unless* and *if* together:

- *I’ll try to get there about 6.30 **unless** you want me to arrive earlier.*
- Not: *~~I’ll try to get there about 6.30 unless if you want me to arrive earlier.~~*
