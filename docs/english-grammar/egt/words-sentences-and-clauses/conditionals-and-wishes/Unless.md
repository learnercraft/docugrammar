# Unless

We use the conjunction *unless* to mean ‘except if’. The clause which follows *unless* is a subordinate clause (sc): it needs a main clause (mc) to make a complete sentence.

When *unless* comes before the main clause, we use a comma:

- ***Unless*** *\[SC\] it rains, \[MC\] we’ll go for a picnic by the river tomorrow.* (We’ll go for a picnic by the river tomorrow if it doesn’t rain.)

When the main clause comes first, we don’t need a comma:

- *\[MC\] They won’t come **unless** \[SC\] you invite them.*

*Unless* is a conditional word (like *if*), so we don’t use *will* or *would* in the subordinate clause:

- ***Unless*** *I hear from you, I’ll see you at two o’clock.*
- Not: *~~Unless I’ll hear from you~~* …

## Unless and if … not

*Unless* and *if … not* both mean ‘except if’:

- *We could eat at Siam Smile **unless** they’re closed on a Monday.* (or *We could eat at Siam Smile **if** they’re **not** closed on a Monday*.)
- *I’ll make dinner **unless** somebody else wants to.* (or *I’ll make dinner **if*** ***nobody** else wants to*.)
- *Can you turn the radio off **unless** you’re listening to it?* (or *Can you turn the radio off **if** you’re **not** listening to it?*)

We don’t use *unless* for things that we know to be true:

- *You won’t be able to get a ticket for the match **unless** you’re prepared to pay a lot of money for it.* (The speaker doesn’t know if you’re prepared to pay a lot of money for a ticket.)
- *I don’t know what we would have done **if** we had**n’t** seen you.* (We did see you.)
- Not: *~~I don’t know what we would have done unless we’d seen you.~~*

:::warning

In speaking, we use *unless* to introduce an extra thought or piece of information:

- *He didn’t even know about the crash – **unless** he’d heard about it on the radio.*
- A: *Oh look. Neil next door’s got a new car*.
- B: ***Unless*** *they’ve got a visitor*.

## Typical errors

We don’t use *unless* when we mean *if*:

- *Pete will drive **if** Alex can’t.*
- Not: *~~Pete will drive unless Alex can’t.~~*

We don’t use *will* or *would* in the clause after *unless*:

- ***Unless*** *you pay now, we can’t guarantee you a ticket.*
- Not: *~~Unless you’ll pay now~~* …
