# Conjunctions: time

*When, after, before, until, since, while, once, as* and *as soon as* are subordinating conjunctions which can be used to connect an action or an event to a point in time.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>action/event</td><td>conjunction</td><td>time</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>She was in a bad car accident</i></td><td><b><i>when</i></b></td><td><i>she was young.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>We can’t play loud music</i></td><td><b><i>after</i></b></td><td><i>everyone has gone to bed.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Brush your teeth</i></td><td><b><i>before</i></b></td><td><i>you go to bed!</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I’ll wait with you</i></td><td><b><i>until</i></b></td><td><i>the bus comes.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I’ve been very busy</i></td><td><b><i>since</i></b></td><td><i>I started my new job.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>No one left the cinema</i></td><td><b><i>while</i></b></td><td><i>the movie was on.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I’ll call you</i></td><td><b><i>once</i></b></td><td><i>I arrive.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>We always have an ice cream</i></td><td><b><i>as soon as</i></b></td><td><i>we get to the beach.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>I bumped into her</i></td><td><b><i>as</i></b></td><td><i>I came out of the bank.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

Many of these time conjunctions can be followed by *\-ing* or *\-ed* forms instead of subject + verb.

:::warning

We don’t use *will* after conjunctions referring to future time:

- ***When*** *people **walk** into the room, they will feel something special.*
- Not: *~~When people will walk into the room~~*…

- *I will call you **as soon as** I **get** to the office.*
- Not: … ~~as soon as I will get to the office.~~

## When, once, as soon as

We can use *when, once, as* and *as soon as* to talk about a specific point in time when something happened or will happen:

- ***When*** *we were in Greece, we went to as many islands as possible.*
- *They always close their curtains **once** they get home in the evening.*
- ***As soon as*** *we hear any news, we’ll call you.*

## Before, after and until

We use *before* and *after* to talk about the order of events in the past or future. With *before* and *after*, either the main clause or the subordinate clause can come first:

- *\[event 1\] She’ll pick you up **before** \[event 2\] she comes here.*
- ***After*** *\[event 1\] she comes here, \[event 2\] she’ll pick you up.*

*Until* as a time conjunction means up to a time in the past or future. In the case of *until*, the main clause usually comes first:

- *I’m going to wait **until** the January sales start to buy a new jacket.*
- ***Until*** *he mentioned his name was Doug, I thought he was called Damien!* (less common order)

We spell *until* with one *l*. (Not: *~~untill~~*)

## While

We use *while* to show that actions or events happen at the same time in the past, present or future:

- *Can you wait in the car **while** I run into the shop?*
- *They were talking **while** the teacher was explaining the activity.*

:::warning

We don’t use *during* instead of *while. During* is a preposition, not a conjunction, and it must be followed by a noun or a pronoun:

- *I like to have the radio on **while** I study.*
- Not: *~~I like to have the radio on during I study.~~*
