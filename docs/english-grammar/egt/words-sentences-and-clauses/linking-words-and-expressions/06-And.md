## Go and, come and

Spoken English:

In informal speaking we often use *and* after *go* and *come* before verbs like *ask, buy, check, collect, do, find, get*:

- *Why don’t you **go and ask** her?*
- *I need to **go and buy** myself some running shoes.*
- *Can you **come and do** the washing up?*
