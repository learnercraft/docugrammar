# Because, because of and cos, cos of

## Because: meaning and use

*Because* introduces clauses of cause and reason. It is a subordinating conjunction. This means that the clause it introduces is a subordinate clause, which needs a main clause to make it complete. We use a comma when the subordinate clause comes before the main clause:

- *\[main clause\] Everyone left early **because** \[subordinate clause\] Mark and Helen had an argument.*
- *\[subordinate clause\] **Because** they were so tired, \[main clause\] they went to bed at 9 pm.*

:::warning

We don’t use *for* or *why* instead of *because* when we are giving reasons:

- *I’m going to go to the company’s head office on Monday **because** there is an emergency meeting there.*
- Not: … ~~to the company’s head office on Monday for/why there is an emergency~~ …

:::note[See also]

- *As*, *because* or *since*?

## Because of

*Because of* is a two-word preposition meaning ‘as a result of’:

- ***Because of*** *the rain, the tennis match was stopped.*
- *There were so many people in the shop **because of** the sale.*

## Cos

*Cos*, a short form of *because*, is pronounced /kəz/ or /kɒz/ and can also be spelt *’cause*. It can be used instead of *because* (and *cos of* instead of *because of*). We often use it in speaking, emails and text messages, especially in informal situations:

- A: *Why are you and Adam not talking to each other?*
- B: ***Cos*** *he’s always saying nasty things about me*.
- *I don’t eat meat **cos** I love animals.*
- *They cancelled the trip **cos*** ***of** the snow.*

## Just because, simply because

We can emphasise *because* with *just* or *simply*:

- ***Just because*** *you’re the boss, it doesn’t mean you can be rude to everyone.*
- *I don’t want to do it **simply because** I think it’s wrong.*
