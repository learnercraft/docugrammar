# Whereas

We use the conjunction *whereas* to indicate a contrast between two facts or ideas:

- *He loves foreign holidays, **whereas** his wife prefers to stay at home.*
- ***Whereas*** *most new PCs have several USB slots, older ones often only had one.*

:::warning

*Whereas* means the same as *while* in sentences expressing contrasts. It does not mean the same as *while* when *while* refers to time:

- *The south has a hot, dry climate, **whereas**/**while** the north has a milder, wetter climate.*
- *The secretary took care of my appointments **while** I was away from the office.*
- Not: â€¦ ~~whereas I was away from the office.~~

- *While* and *whilst*
