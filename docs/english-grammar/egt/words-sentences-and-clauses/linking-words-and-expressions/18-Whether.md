# Whether

*Whether* is a conjunction.

## Whether in indirect questions

We use *whether* in indirect *yes-no* questions and questions with *or*. We can’t leave out *whether* (or *if*):

- *They asked me **whether** (**if**) I was tired.*
- (original question: *Are you tired?*)
- Not: *~~They asked me I was tired.~~*
- *I want to find out **whether** (**if**) the rooms have a shower or not.*
- (original question: *Do the rooms have a shower or not?*)
- Not: *~~I want to find out the rooms have a shower or not.~~*

We don’t use *either* in indirect questions:

- *We can’t say **whether** tourism is harmful or beneficial.*
- Not: *~~We can’t say either tourism is harmful or beneficial.~~*

## Whether … or

We use *whether … or* to introduce a clause giving two options or alternatives:

- *I can’t decide **whether** to paint the wall green **or** blue.* (or to paint the wall blue)
- *She didn’t know **whether** he was laughing **or** crying.*

When the subject of the main clause is the same as the subject of the *whether*\-clause(s), we can use *whether to* + infinitive or *whether* + a finite clause. When the subject of the main clause is different from the subject of the subordinate clause, we have to use a finite clause.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>same subject</td><td>different subject</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>We’re not sure </i><b><i>whether</i></b><i> to stay here for dinner </i><b><i>or</i></b><i> go somewhere else.</i>(<i>whether</i> + <i>to</i> + infinitive)</td><td><i>We’re not sure </i><b><i>whether</i></b><i> he’ll stay here for dinner </i><b><i>or</i></b><i> go somewhere else.</i>(<i>whether</i> + finite clause)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>We’re not sure </i><b><i>whether</i></b><i> we’ll stay here for dinner </i><b><i>or</i></b><i> go somewhere else.</i>(<i>whether</i> + finite clause)</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Whether … or not

We use *whether … or not* or *whether or not* to give an opposite alternative:

- *We use the title Ms rather than Mrs (married woman) or Miss (unmarried woman) when we don’t know **whether** a woman is married **or not**.*
- *I’m not sure **whether or not** to go to camping this weekend.*

We often use *whether … or not* to mean ‘it’s not important if’ or ‘it doesn’t matter if’. We don’t use *either* in this way:

- *He always said what he thought, **whether** it was polite **or not**.*
- Not: … ~~either it was polite or not.~~

We can use *whether … or not* in front or end position with this meaning. We use it in orders or commands:

- ***Whether*** *you like it **or not**, you’re going to have to look after your sister.*
- (or *You’re going to have to look after your sister*, ***whether*** *you like it* ***or*** ***not***.)

## Typical errors

We use *whether*, not *if*, before a *to*\-infinitive:

- *I’m not sure **whether** to get a new laptop.*
- Not: *~~I’m not sure if to get a new laptop.~~*

We use *whether … or not*, not *either*, to mean ‘it’s not important that’:

- *We have to accept that they are part of our lives, **whether** we like it **or not**.*
- Not: … ~~either we like it or not.~~

We use *whether*, not *either*, in indirect questions:

- *She has to decide **whether** she is going to accept the job or not.*
- Not: *~~She has to decide either~~* …

We can’t leave out *whether* (or *if*) in indirect questions:

- *I want to find out **whether**/**if** the rooms have a shower or not.*
- Not: *~~I want to find out the rooms have a shower or not.~~*

Take care to spell *whether* correctly: not ‘weather’, ‘wheter’, ‘wheather’ or ‘wether’.
