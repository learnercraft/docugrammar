# Yet

*Yet* is an adverb or conjunction.

## Yet as an adverb

We use *yet* as an adverb to refer to a time which starts in the past and continues up to the present. We use it mostly in negative statements or questions in the present perfect. It usually comes in end position:

- *Kevin hasn’t registered for class **yet**.*
- *I haven’t finished my breakfast **yet**.*
- *Has she emailed you **yet**?*

:::warning

We don’t use *yet* to refer to something that has happened. We use *already*:

- *She’s booked the flights **already**.*
- Not: *~~She’s booked the flights yet.~~*

:::

We don’t use *yet* to talk about events that are continuing:

- *Elizabeth is **still** living in Manchester. She’s not moving to London till next month.*
- Not: *~~Elizabeth is living yet~~ … or ~~Elizabeth is yet living~~* …

### Yet with negative statements

When we use y*et* in negative statements, it shows that an event is expected to happen in the future:

- *Jason hasn’t phoned **yet**.* (I am expecting him to phone.)
- *I haven’t seen ‘Who Framed Roger Rabbit’ **yet**.* (I am expecting to see this film.)

### Yet with questions

When we use *yet* in an affirmative question, it shows that the speaker is expecting something to happen:

- *Is he home **yet**?* (I expect that he will be home at some point.)
- *Has your passport arrived **yet**?* (I expect that your passport will arrive in the post.)

Negative questions with *yet* can express an even stronger expectation that something will happen. When we ask this type of question, we expect a negative answer:

- *Has**n’t** Richard arrived **yet**?* (I strongly expect that he should have arrived.)
- *Have**n’t** you done your driving test **yet**?* (I feel you should have done your driving test by now.)

### Yet with affirmative statements

When we use *yet* in affirmative statements, it shows that a situation is continuing, even when we might expect it not to continue:

- *There’s plenty of time **yet**.* (even though you don’t think so)
- *We’ve got a lot more work to do **yet**.* (even though you think we have finished)

### Yet with superlatives

We often use *yet* after superlatives:

- *His latest film is his best **yet**.* (The film is the best one he has made up to now.)
- *Two hours and 15 minutes – that’s Jones’s fastest marathon **yet**!*

## Yet as a conjunction

*Yet* as a conjunction means ‘but’ or ‘nevertheless’. We use it to show contrast. It often occurs after *and*:

- *So many questions **and yet** so few answers.*
- *It felt strange **and yet** so wonderful to ski in the summer!*

## Yet for emphasis

We use *yet* for emphasis, with a meaning similar to ‘even’, especially before *more*, *another* and *again*:

- *The cook arrived with **yet another** plate of cake.*
- *The printer’s broken down **yet again**!* (It has broken down many times before.)

## As yet

*As yet* means ‘up to now, but the situation will definitely change’. We only use it in negative contexts:

- *The film shows you the most typical places, **as yet** untouched by tourism, and how to get there.*

## Have yet to and be yet to

We use *have yet to* and *be yet to* in more formal contexts. We use them to refer to events which are necessary or which must happen at some time, but which have not happened at the time of speaking:

- *The price of the tickets for the concert **has yet to** be decided.* (The price will be decided.)
- *The President and her husband **are yet to** arrive.* (The President and her husband will arrive.)
