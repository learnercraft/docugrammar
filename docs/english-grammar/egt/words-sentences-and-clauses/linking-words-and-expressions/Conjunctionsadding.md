# Conjunctions: adding

## Adding with and

One of the main uses of conjunctions is to add phrases and clauses together.

The most common conjunction for adding is *and*:

### Adding words

- *I love pictures of \[word\] puppies **and** \[word\] kittens.*

### Adding phrases

- *It was not a very nice walk because of \[phrase\] the wind **and** \[phrase\] the rain.*

### Adding clauses

- *\[clause\] Some of the rooms have one big bed **and** \[clause\] some of them have two smaller beds.*

### Adding sentences

- *\[sentence\] They worked together for more than twenty years. **And** \[sentence\] made a lot of money, too.*

In formal writing we don’t normally start a sentence with *and*.

### Adding prefixes

- *Tell me how much it will cost \[prefix\] pre- **and** \[prefix\] post-tax.*

:::warning

When *and* is used in a list, it is normally only used between the last two items in the list:

- *We had pasta, roasted peppers **and** salad.*
- Not: *~~We had pasta, and roasted peppers, and salad~~*.

:::

In British English, a comma is optional before *and* in lists. In American English, we usually do put a comma before *and*:

- *I need envelopes, paper clips, pens and printer ink.* (BrE)
- *I need envelopes, paper clips, pens, and printer ink.* (AmE)

- *And*
- Punctuation
- British and American English

## Adding with and … too

Spoken English:

In speaking, we can also use *and … too* to connect words, phrases and clauses. *Too* focuses on the addition:

- *We bought lots of ice cream for the party, **and** sweets **too**.*
- *We went to the circus, **and** Hilda came **too**.*

- Conjunctions
- *Too*

## Adding with as well as and in addition to

*As well as* is more common than *in addition to. In addition to* is more formal and used more in writing than in speaking:

- ***As well as*** *offering a 15% discount on the furniture, Smith’s Furniture delivered it free to our house.*
- ***In addition to*** *cutting jobs, the company has announced that its profits are down for this year.*

:::warning

When they are followed by clauses *as well as* or *in addition to* can only be followed by a verb in the *\-ing* form (non-finite clauses):

- *You become less selfish **as well as learning** how to interact with other people.*
- Not: *~~You become less selfish as well as you learn how to interact~~*.…

- *If we worked in this shop, I think we would get good work experience **in addition to practising** our English.*
- ***In addition to doing*** *an exam, applicants also had to do an interview.*
- Not: *~~In addition to they did an exam~~* …
