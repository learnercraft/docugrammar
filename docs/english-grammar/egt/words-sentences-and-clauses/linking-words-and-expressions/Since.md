# Since

We use *since* as a preposition, a conjunction and an adverb to refer to a time, and as a conjunction to introduce a reason.

## Since: time

We use *since* to refer back to a previous point in time. We use *since* as a preposition with a date, a time or a noun phrase:

- *It was the band’s first live performance **since** May 1990.* (*since* + date)
- *I have been happily married for 26 years, **since** the age of 21.* (*since* + noun phrase)

We also use *since* as a conjunction to introduce a subordinate clause:

- *It’s so long **since** I saw them.* (*since* + clause)
- *Lenny had slept most of the way **since** leaving Texas.* (*since* + clause)
- *He’s been back to the office a few times **since** he retired.* (*since* + clause)

## Since and tenses

When *since* introduces an action or event at a point of time in the past, we can use the past simple or present perfect after *since* and the present perfect in the main clause:

- *They haven’t received any junk mail **since** they moved house.*
- *They haven’t received any junk mail **since** they’ve moved house.*

We can use the past simple, present perfect or past perfect after *since* with the expression *it* + *be* + time + *since*:

- ***It’s been years*** ***since*** *I rode a bike.* (*it’s* = *it has*)
- ***It’s been years*** ***since*** *I’ve ridden a bike.* (*it’s* = *it has*)
- ***It’s years since*** *I rode a bike.* (*it’s* = *it is*)
- ***It’s years*** ***since*** *I’ve ridden a bike.* (*it’s* = *it is*)
- ***It’d been years*** ***since*** *I’d ridden a bike.* (*it’d* = *it had*)

*It’s been years since …* is more common in American English than *It’s years since …*.

When *since* introduces a state in the past that is still continuing in the present, we use a present perfect form of the verb after *since* and a present perfect form of the verb in the main clause:

- ***Since*** *I’ve been back at work, I’ve been feeling great.*

- *For* or *since*?
- Present perfect continuous (*I have been working*)
- Past perfect continuous (*I had been working*)

## Since \+ \-ing

We can use *since* + -*ing* form to refer to time when the subject of the verb is the same in the main clause and the subordinate clause:

- ***Since*** *leav**ing** school, he has had three or four temporary jobs.* (Since he left school, he has …)
- ***Since*** *mov**ing** from a Chicago suburb to southern California a few months ago, I’ve learned how to play a new game called Lanesmanship.* (Since I moved …, I’ve learned …)

## Since, since then

We can use *since* or *since then* as an adverb of time when the time reference is understood from the context:

- *His father doesn’t talk to him. They had an argument a couple of years ago and they haven’t spoken **since**.* (since they had the argument)
- *They bought the house in 2006 and they’ve done a lot of work on it **since*** ***then**.* (since 2006)

We use *ever since* as a stronger form of *since* or *since then*:

- *When I was young, I had a little collie dog, but one day he bit me really badly. I’ve hated dogs **ever since**.*

## Since: reason

We use *since* as a subordinating conjunction to introduce a subordinate clause. We use it to give a reason for something:

- *Sean had no reason to take a taxi **since** his flat was near enough to walk to.*
- ***Since*** *her husband hated holidays so much, she decided to go on her own.*
- *They couldn’t deliver the parcel **since** no one was there to answer the door.*

- *As*
- *Because*

## Since: typical errors

We don’t use *since* with extended periods of time. We use *for*:

- *She was waiting **for** four hours.*
- Not: *~~She was waiting since four hours.~~*

We use *since*, not *from*, with a clause referring back to a point in time:

- *I’ve been swimming **since** I was three years old.*
- *I’ve been swimming **from** the age of three.*
- Not: *~~I’ve been swimming from I was three years old.~~*

We use *since*, not *once*, to introduce a reason:

- *I think I should have my money back **since** I didn’t have what was promised in the brochure.*
- Not: *~~I think I should have my money back once I didn’t have~~* …

We use *since*, not *ago*, after ‘it’s a long time’ when we refer back to a point in time:

- *It’s a long time **since** your last letter.*
- Not: *~~It’s a long time ago your last letter.~~*
