# That\-clauses

We use *that* as a conjunction to link a verb, adjective or noun with the following clause.

## Verb + that\-clause

Verbs commonly followed by *that* include reporting verbs (*say, tell, admit*, etc.) and mental process verbs (*believe, think, know, hope*, etc.):

- *They **said*** ***that** four million workers stayed at home to protest against the tax.*
- *The survey **indicated*** ***that** 28 per cent would prefer to buy a house through a building society than through a bank.*
- *He **knew*** ***that** something bad had happened.*

## Adjective + that\-clause

We use *be* + adjective + *that*\-clause to express opinions and feelings. Some adjectives commonly used in this way are *sure, certain, right, important, afraid, pleased, sorry, surprised, worried*. We can omit *that* with no change in meaning:

- *It**’s*** ***important** (**that**) we look at the problem in more detail.*
- *I**’m*** ***sure** (**that**) you’ll know a lot of people there.*
- *They **were*** ***afraid** (**that**) we were going to be late.*

## Noun + that\-clause

We use a noun + *that*\-clause to express opinions and feelings, often about certainty and possibility. We also use that with reporting nouns. Some nouns commonly used in this way are *belief, fact, hope, idea, possibility, suggestion, statement, claim, comment, argument*:

- *He is also having intensive treatment in the **hope*** ***that** he will be able to train on Friday.*
- *Dutch police are investigating the **possibility*** ***that** a bomb was planted on the jet.*
