# Neither, neither … nor and not … either

## Neither as a determiner

*Neither* allows us to make a negative statement about two people or things at the same time. *Neither* goes before singular countable nouns. We use it to say ‘not either’ in relation to two things. *Neither* can be pronounced /ˈnaɪðə(r)/ or /ˈni:ðə(r)/*.*

- ***Neither*** *parent came to meet the teacher.* (The mother didn’t come and the father didn’t come.)
- ***Neither*** *dress fitted her.* (There were two dresses and not one of them fitted her.)

We use *neither of* before pronouns and plural countable nouns which have a determiner (*my, his, the*) before them:

- ***Neither*** ***of*** *us went to the concert.*
- ***Neither of*** *the birthday cards was suitable.*

Spoken English:

In formal styles, we use *neither of* with a singular verb when it is the subject. However, in informal speaking, people often use plural verbs:

- ***Neither of*** *my best friends was around.*
- ***Neither of*** *them were interested in going to university.*

In speaking, we can use *neither* on its own in replies when we are referring to two things that have already been mentioned:

- A: *Mike, which would you prefer, tea or coffee?*
- B: ***Neither*** *thanks. I’ve just had a coffee*.

## Neither … nor

We can use *neither* as a conjunction with *nor*. It connects two or more negative alternatives. This can sound formal in speaking:

- ***Neither*** *Brian **nor** his wife mentioned anything about moving house.* (Brian didn’t mention that they were moving house and his wife didn’t mention that they were moving house.)
- ***Neither*** *Italy **nor** France got to the quarter finals last year.*

The less formal alternative is to use *and … not … either*:

- *Italy didn’t get to the quarter finals last year **and** France did**n’t*** ***either**.*

- *Not … either*

## Not with neither and nor

When a clause with *neither* or *nor* is used after a negative clause, we invert the subject and the verb after *neither* and *nor*:

- *He **hadn’t** done any homework, **neither** had he brought any of his books to class.*
- *We did**n’t** get to see the castle, **nor** did we see the cathedral.*

## Neither do I, Nor can she

We use *neither* and *nor* + auxiliary/modal verb + subject to mean ‘also not’:

- A: *I hate snakes. I can’t even look at a picture of a snake*.
- B: ***Neither*** *can I*.
- Not: *~~I can’t also.~~*
- A: *Jacqueline doesn’t drive*.
- B: ***Nor*** *does Gina*.
- Not: *~~Gina doesn’t also.~~*

- *So am I*, *so do I*, *Neither do I*

:::

## Not … either

We can use *not …* *either* to mean ‘also not’, but we do not change the word order of the auxiliary or modal verb and subject:

- A: *I haven’t ever tasted caviar*.
- B: *I have****n’t either***. (or *Neither have I./Nor have I*.)
- A: *I didn’t see Lesley at the concert*.
- B: *I did****n’t either***. (or *Neither did I./Nor did I*.)

In informal speaking, we often say *me neither*:

- A: *I can’t smell anything*.
- B: ***Me neither***. (or *I can’t either*.)

## Neither: typical errors

We use *neither*, not *none*, when we are talking about two people or things:

- *Books and television are different. **Neither of** them should replace the other.*
- Not: *~~None of them~~* …

We don’t normally use *both (of) + not* to make a negative statement about two people or things:

- ***Neither of*** *these shirts is/are dry yet.*
- Not: *~~Both of these shirts aren’t dry yet.~~*

Take care to spell ***neither*** correctly: not ‘niether’ or ‘neighter’.
