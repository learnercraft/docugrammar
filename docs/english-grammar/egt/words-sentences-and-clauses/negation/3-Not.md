# Not

*Not* is one of the most common words we use to indicate negation. It is often shortened to *n’t* and joined to an auxiliary verb or modal verb:

- *She’s **not** coming with us.*
- *I did**n’t** see what happened.* *(did not)*
- *I ca**n’t** swim.* *(cannot)*
- *She **won’t** change her mind.* *(will not)*
- *It’s at eight o’clock, **not** nine.*
- A: *Is that true?*
- B: *Certainly* ***not***.
- A: *Are you ready?*
- B: ***Not*** *quite*.

## Not in negative statements (She hasn’t …, I did not …)

We form negative declarative clauses with *not* after *be* (*she is not talking*), after modal verbs (*they must not go*) and after auxiliary verbs *do* and *have* (*we did not like it; they have not eaten*).

In informal situations, we add *n’t* to *be*, modal verbs and auxiliary verbs *do* and *have*. There is no space between the verb and *n’t*:

- *She is**n’t** worried about it, is she?*
- *We ca**n’t** walk. It’s too far. I’ll take the car.*
- *Although he does**n’t** know much Chinese, he is fluent in French, German, and Italian.*
- *I have**n’t** seen Peter for ages.*

We don’t use *n’t* with *am* and *may*:

- *I**’m*** ***not** allowed to go out this evening.*
- Not: *~~I amn’t allowed to~~* … (*amn’t* is common in Irish and Scots English, however.)

- *We **may not** see you later. We have to leave early.*
- Not: *~~We mayn’t see you later.~~*

With *is* and *are* there are two possible negative statements, *’s not* or *isn’t* and *’re* *not* or *aren’t*. The forms *’s not* and *’re not* are more common after pronouns; *isn’t* and *aren’t* are more common after noun phrases:

- *The girls **aren’t** here yet. They**’re*** ***not** coming until later.*
- *The programme **isn’t** ready. It**’s not** printed yet.* (or *The programme’s **not** ready yet*.)

In questions and question tags we use *aren’t* with *I*:

- ***Aren’t I*** *lucky?*
- *I’m right, **aren’t I**?*

We use the full form *not* for more formal writing or for emphasis:

- *It had **not** been an easy year.*
- *He was **not** sorry and he is not ashamed.*
- *The Lady Jinneth went out riding alone this afternoon, and she has **not** yet come back.*

## Not and n’t in questions (Did you not …? Wasn’t she …?)

We use *not* or *n’t* to form negative questions:

- *Why have**n’t** you eaten anything?*
- *Could**n’t** he pay someone to help him with the garden?*
- *Was**n’t** it Cath’s party last night?*
- *Were**n’t** you listening?*

When there is no modal verb or auxiliary verb or *be*, we use auxiliary verb *do* + *n’t* or *do* + *not* (*don’t, do not, doesn’t, does not, didn’t, did not*):

- *Why did**n’t** you go?*
- *Do**n’t** those two go to school together?*

Questions with *not* instead of *n’t* sound more formal or give more emphasis. We put *not* after the subject.

## Don’t, Do not: orders and instructions

We use *don’t* *+* the base form of the verb or *do + not* + the base form of the verb to make negative imperatives. We use these to give orders, instructions or commands. *Do not* is stronger and much more formal:

- ***Don’t*** *be an idiot!*
- ***Don’t*** *open the oven door until the cake is cooked.*
- \[on an envelope containing photos\]
- *PHOTOS: **DO NOT** BEND*
- ***Do*** ***not*** *turn off your computer without shutting down properly.*

We use *don’t + you* in informal speaking to make the order stronger:

- *We’re getting divorced. **Don’t you** dare tell anyone!*

We can use *don’t* *let’s* or *let’s not* for first person plural imperatives (*us*) to make suggestions:

- ***Don’t let’s*** *go out.* (or ***Let’s*** ***not*** *go out*.)

We can use the short form *don’t* as an imperative answer or reaction to something:

- A: *Shall I ask Mum to help?*
- B: *No, **don’t**. She’s too tired*. (No, don’t ask Mum to help us.)

## Not: short replies

We use *not* in negative short replies with mental process verbs (e.g. *be afraid, guess, hope*):

- A: *Will I see you tomorrow, Harry?*
- B: *Oh, Alice*, ***I’m afraid not***.

- A: *Will he have to go back into hospital?*
- B: ***I hope not***.

- A: *Aren’t you coming with us?*
- B: ***I guess not***. *Rosie’s not keen*.

With *think*, we usually use *I don’t think so* rather than *I think not*, which is much more formal and rare:

- A: *Is it going to rain?*
- B: ***I don’t think so***.

In short replies to *yes-no* questions, we use *not* after adverbs like *probably, maybe, certainly* to express degrees of certainty:

- A: *Do you think she’ll remember to come at five instead of six?*
- B: ***Probably not***.

- *So* and *not* with *expect*, *hope*, *think*, etc.

## Not: contrast

We often use *not* after *but* to express a contrast. We often leave out the verb phrase or part of it in the second clause:

- *You can look but **not** touch.* (You can look but you can’t touch.)
- *Write the instructions in capitals but **not** in bold.* (Write the instructions in capitals but don’t write them in bold.)
- *There were a few problems but **not** too many.* (There were a few problems but there weren’t too many problems.)

## Not \+ -ing and not \+ to

We use *not* before an *\-ing* clause in more formal styles:

- ***Not*** *know**ing** what to say, she started to walk towards the door.*
- ***Not*** *be**ing** heard or listened to is something that elderly people can find frightening.*
- *She didn’t want to admit to **not** knowing what the Emerald Isle was.* (‘The Emerald Isle’ is another name for Ireland.)

We use *not* to negate a *to*\-infinitive clause. We can use *not* before or after *to*, but some people consider ‘split infinitives’ (when *not* comes between *to* and the verb) to be incorrect:

- *She tried **not** to offend people.*
- *… she wanted to stay for a long time, to **not** think, to **not** be afraid, to **not** be so, so lonely.*

## Or not

We can use *or not* in questions to ask about a range of possibilities:

- *Are they coming today **or not**?*

We sometimes use it to force someone to make a decision:

- *Are you going to apologise to me **or not**?* (Are you going to apologise to me or are you not going to apologise to me?)
- *Do you want to hear this story **or not**?*

We often use *or not* after *if* or *whether* to express a contrast in expectation:

- *He always spoke the truth **whether** it was popular **or not**.*
