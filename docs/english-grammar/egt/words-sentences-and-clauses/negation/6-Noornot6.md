# No or not?

*No* and *not* are the two most common words we use to indicate negation. We use *no* before a noun phrase:

- *There’s **no** address on the envelope.*
- \[parent to child\]
- ***No*** *biscuits before dinner!*
- ***No*** *decisions have been made.*

We use *not* with any other phrase or clause:

- *It’s **not** often that you stop and think about the way you breathe.*
- ***Not*** *suitable for children under 15.*
- ***Not*** *surprisingly, it was a tense match but eventually the more experienced Australians won.*
- A: *Do you go cycling all year round?*
- B: ***Not*** *in the winter*.
- Not: *~~No in the winter~~*.

## No or not any?

There is very little difference in meaning between *There is/are no +* noun and *There isn’t/aren’t any +* noun:

- *There’s **no** reason to be afraid of her.* (or *There is**n’t*** ***any** reason to be afraid of her*.)
- *There are **no** eggs in the fridge.* (or *There are**n’t*** ***any** eggs in the fridge*.)

*No* + noun often makes the negative stronger. In speaking, we often stress *no*.

## No or Not a/an?

When a noun has an ungradable meaning (it is either something or it is not) we cannot use *no* + noun:

- *A potato is **not a** fruit.*
- Not: *~~A potato is no fruit.~~*

When a noun has a gradable meaning, *no* + noun means the same as *not a/an* + noun:

- \[a football manager talking about signing a new player\]
- *It’s **no** secret that we are interested.* (= It’s not a secret. A secret is gradable. Something can be more of a secret than something else.)

## Responding to a question

We often use *no* to respond to a *yes-no* question, or to agree with a negative statement. We don’t use *not* on its own in this way:

- A: *Do you need anything from the shops?*
- B: ***No***. *I went earlier, thanks*.
- A: *He’s not going to get any better*.
- B: ***No***. *You’re right*.
- Not: *~~Not. You’re right.~~*

## No problem, no good, not worth

We use *no* and *not* in some common fixed expressions:

- A: *When you see Alan, can you give him this letter?*
- B: *Yes sure*, ***no problem***.

- *She had **no idea** what time they were arriving.*
- *It’s **no good** standing around watching. Do something!*
- *You’ve got **no chance** of getting a ticket now. They’re all sold out.*
- *It’s **not worth** taking a taxi. We can walk.*
