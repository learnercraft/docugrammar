# Questions: alternative questions (Is it black or grey?)

An alternative question gives a choice of two or more answers in the question and includes *or*:

- *Would you like \[choice 1\] **some ice cream*** ***or** \[choice 2\] **some cake**?*

## Forming alternative questions

### With an auxiliary verb

We usually form alternative questions with an auxiliary verb (*be, do* or *have*) + subject + main verb or with a modal verb + subject + main verb:

- ***Are we eating*** *in or out this evening?* (answer: *We’re eating in*. or *We’re eating out*.)
- ***Does she work*** *in the city or in the suburbs?* (answer: *She works in the city*. or *She works in the suburbs*.)
- ***Will they buy*** *a house or rent somewhere?* (answer: *They’ll buy a house*. or *They’ll* *rent somewhere*.)

:::warning

When we ask alternative questions using the main verb *be*, we don’t use an auxiliary verb. The word order is: *be* + *subject*:

- ***Is*** *this the front or the back of the dress?*

## Different types of alternative question

We can also ask alternative questions using *or not?* This is a very direct question and sometimes it can express annoyance or impatience:

- *\[choice 1\] Are you coming \[choice 2\] **or*** ***not**?*
- *\[choice 1\] Do you want to go to the cinema \[choice 2\] **or*** ***not**?*

Alternative questions can be answered as *yes-no* questions, depending on the context:

- A: *Are there **trains or buses** from the airport to Belgrade?*
- B: *Yes, there are*. (There are both trains and buses.)
- (or *There’s a train./There’s a bus*.)

Alternative questions can be *wh*\-questions:

- *Which do you prefer, **with or without salt**?*
- *Which is best, to water the plant **every day or just once a week**?*

## Reduced alternative questions (tea or coffee?)

:::warning

Sometimes in informal speaking, we make alternative questions shorter by just saying the alternatives:

- A: *Would you like a coffee?*
- B: *That’d be great*.
- A: ***Black or white?***
- B: *Black, please*.
- A: *Are you renting an apartment in London?*
- B: *Yeah, very near Paddington Station*.
- A: ***Sharing or on your own?***
- B: *I’m sharing with some old friends*.

## Responding to alternative questions

We can answer an alternative question in different ways, but we do not normally answer *yes*:

- A: *Would you like mayonnaise or butter on it?*

Possible responses:

- B: *Mayonnaise, please*.
- *Butter, please.*
- *Both, please.*
- *Neither, thanks.* (*Neither* means that you don’t want mayonnaise or butter.)
- *No, thanks.* (*No* means that you don’t want either alternative.)
- Not: *~~Yes.~~*
