# Questions: two-step questions

In speaking, we sometimes ask two questions together. The first question is just an introduction for the listener. We use these especially when we don’t want to be too direct:

- *\[1\] What do you think about this building? \[2\] I mean, do you like it?*
- (The first question introduces the topic of the building, the second one asks a more specific question about it. The listener answers the second question.)

- *\[1\] Do you miss home? \[2\] Like, do you miss your mother’s cooking?*
- (The first question introduces the topic of missing home, the second one asks a more specific question about it. The listener answers the second question.)

## Two-step yes-no questions

We sometimes use *yes-no* questions one after the other. The first question is an introduction to the topic and the speaker usually knows the answer. The second question is more specific.

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>A: <i>Are you driving to college tomorrow?</i>B: <i>Yeah. I’m hoping to leave at 8 am</i>.A: <i>Could I have a lift with you?</i></td><td>A: <i>Could I have a lift with you if you are driving to college?</i>B: <i>Yeah sure. I’m hoping to leave at 8 am</i>.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>The first question is introductory. A knows that B usually drives to college. The second question is more specific. By asking the question in two stages, the speaker is being less direct with the listener.</td><td>A asks B for a lift to college all in one question. This is correct too, but it is slightly more direct.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Pre-questions in two-step questions

Sometimes we ask if we can ask a question. This is very polite:

- A: ***Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?***
- B: *Sure*.
- A: *Do you like Janie?*
- B: *Well, most of the time, I do*.

In formal contexts, such as interviews, we commonly use these polite pre-questions before we ask the main question:

- ***May I ask you a question about your last job?*** *Why did you leave it?*

We can add *just* and *please* to make them even more polite:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>Polite</td><td>More polite</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Can I ask a question?</i></td><td><i>Can I </i><b><i>just</i></b><i> ask a question, </i><b><i>please</i></b><i>?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>May I ask a question?</i></td><td><i>May I </i><b><i>just</i></b><i> ask a question, </i><b><i>please</i></b><i>?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Could I ask a question?</i></td><td><i>Could I </i><b><i>just</i></b><i> ask a question, </i><b><i>please</i></b><i>?</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Two-step questions that suggest the answer

We also use two-step questions to first ask a question and then suggest an answer with a rising or fall-rising intonation. The speaker is quite sure of the answer and wants the listener to confirm it:

- *Where are you from, Helen? **Manc***↗***hester**?*
- A: *When’s our flight? **Aroun***↘***d e***↗***ight**?*
- B: *Yeah, 8.10 am*.
