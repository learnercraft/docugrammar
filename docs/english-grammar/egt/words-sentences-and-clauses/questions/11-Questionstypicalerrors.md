# Questions: typical errors

In *wh-*questions, the word order changes from subject + (auxiliary/modal) + main verb to *wh-*word + auxiliary/modal verb + subject + main verb:

- *What was she eating?*
- Not: *~~What she was eating?~~*

In *yes-no* questions, the word order changes from subject + (auxiliary verb) + main verb to auxiliary verb + subject + main verb:

- *Were you talking to Johnny?*
- *Did you tell Rosa about what happened?*

If there is no auxiliary verb in the affirmative, we use *do* before the subject:

- ***Do*** *you agree?*
- Not: *~~Are you agree?~~*

- *What **does** art mean?*
- Not: *~~What art means?~~ or ~~What means art?~~*

We can only use auxiliary and modal verbs, not main verbs, before the subject:

- *Where **was** the painting bought?*
- Not: *~~Where was bought the painting?~~*
- *How **is** the fish cooked?*
- Not: *~~How is cooked the fish?~~*

We use *what*, not *which*, to ask about specific information from a general range of possible answers:

- ***What****â€™s the name of the man who owns your company?*
- Not: *~~Which is the name of the man who owns your company?~~*
