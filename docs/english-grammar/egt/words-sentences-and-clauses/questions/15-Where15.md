# Where

*Where* is a *wh*\-word. We use *where* to ask questions, as a conjunction and to introduce relative clauses.

## Where as a question word

We can use *where* to ask for information about place:

- ***Where*** *did you buy those shoes?*
- ***Where*** *will you be working next Monday?*

We can use *where* in indirect questions:

- *I asked him **where** I could buy an umbrella.*
- *Can you tell me **where** she left the keys?*

## Emphatic questions with wherever and where on earth

We can ask emphatic questions using *wherever* or *where on earth* to express shock or surprise. We stress *ever* and *earth*:

- ***Wher***ever *are you going with such a big bag?* (stronger than *Where are you going?*)
- ***Where*** on earth *have I put my wallet?* (stronger than *Where have I put my wallet?*)

## Where as a conjunction

We use *where* as a conjunction meaning ‘in the place that’ or ‘in situations that’. The clause with *where* is a subordinate clause and needs a main clause to complete its meaning. If the *where* clause comes before the main clause, we use a comma:

- ***Where*** *you find a lot of water, you will also find these beautiful insects.*
- ***Where*** *you have to pay a deposit, be sure to get a receipt.*

## Where as a relative pronoun

We can use *where* as a relative pronoun:

- *The hotel **where** we spent our honeymoon has been demolished.*
- *The hall **where** you’re giving your talk has a really good sound system.*
