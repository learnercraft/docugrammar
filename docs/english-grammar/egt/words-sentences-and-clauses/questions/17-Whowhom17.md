# Who, whom

*Who* and *whom* are *wh*\-words. We use them to ask questions and to introduce relative clauses.

## Who as a question word

We use *who* as an interrogative pronoun to begin questions about people:

- ***Who****’s next?*
- ***Who*** *makes the decisions here?*
- ***Who*** *did you talk to?*

We use *who* in indirect questions and statements:

- *The phone rang. She asked me **who** it was.*
- *Can you tell me **who** I should talk to.*
- *I can’t remember **who** told me.*

## Emphatic questions with whoever and who on earth

We can ask emphatic questions using *whoever* or *who on earth* to express shock or surprise. We stress *ever* and *earth*:

- ***Who***ever *does she think she is, speaking to us like that?* (stronger than *Who does she think she is?*)
- ***Who on*** earth *has left all this rubbish here?* (stronger than *Who has left all this rubbish here?*)

## Who in relative clauses

We use *who* as a relative pronoun to introduce a relative clause about people:

- *The police officer **who** came was a friend of my father’s.*
- *He shared a flat with Anne Bolton, **who** he married, and eventually they moved to Australia.*

## Whom

*Whom* is the object form of *who*. We use *whom* to refer to people in formal styles or in writing, when the person is the object of the verb. We don’t use it very often and we use it more commonly in writing than in speaking.

We use *whom* commonly with prepositions. Some formal styles prefer to use a preposition before *whom* than to leave the preposition ‘hanging’ at the end of the sentence:

- *Before a job interview it is a good idea, if you can, to find out some background information about the people **for whom** you would be working.* (preferred in some formal styles to *… about the people **whom** you would be working* ***for***)
- *Over 200 people attended the ceremony, many **of whom** had known Harry as their teacher.*

We use it in relative clauses:

- *She gave birth in 1970 to a boy **whom** she named Caleb James.*

We use it in indirect questions and statements:

- *He didn’t ask **for*** ***whom** I had voted.*
- *He told me where he went and **with*** ***whom**.* (preferred in some formal styles to *He told me where he went and* ***who with***.)
