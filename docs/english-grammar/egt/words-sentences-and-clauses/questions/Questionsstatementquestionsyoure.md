# Questions: statement questions (you’re over 18?)

We can use statements (declaratives) to ask *yes-no* questions. In writing we know they are questions because they have question marks. In speaking we know they are questions because of the context, and often because of their intonation:

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>Question form</td><td>Statement as question</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Is that your father?</i></td><td><i>That’s your father?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Do we pay at the end?</i></td><td><i>We pay at the end?</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Has she worked in a hotel before?</i></td><td><i>She’s worked in a hotel before?</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

Statement questions can be affirmative or negative:

- A: *So you’re from Lo*↗*ndon?* (rising intonation)
- B: *Yeah, that’s right*.

- A: *So you’re not from Lo*↗*ndon?* (rising intonation)
- B: *No, I’m from Manchester originally*.

The intonation of a statement question depends on its meaning. We use statement questions when we think we know the answer to the question and we want to find out if we’re right. In these cases we can use falling intonation:

- A: *Right, so today is* *the 8*↘*th?*
- B: *Yep*. (*Yep* is an informal way of saying *yes*.)

Compare

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><i>You went to Northbridge H</i>↗<i>igh School?</i></td><td>Rising intonation: I think you went to Northbridge High School but I am not sure.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>You went to Northbridg</i>↘<i>e High School?</i></td><td>Falling intonation: I am very sure that you went to Northbridge High School.</td></tr></tbody></table>

We can also use statement questions to express surprise. When we express surprise, we use rising intonation (indicated in the examples below with ↗):

- A: *I’ve made a coffee cake*.
- B: ***That’s a*** ***coffe***↗***e cake?***
- A: *Friday is Kyle’s last day at work*.
- B: ***Kyle’s le***↗***aving?***
