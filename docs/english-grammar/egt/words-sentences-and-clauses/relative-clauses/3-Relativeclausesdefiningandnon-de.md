# Relative clauses: defining and non-defining

## Defining relative clauses

We use defining relative clauses to give essential information about someone or something – information that we need in order to understand what or who is being referred to. A defining relative clause usually comes immediately after the noun it describes.

We usually use a relative pronoun (e.g. *who, that, which, whose* and *whom*) to introduce a defining relative clause (In the examples, the relative clause is in bold, and the person or thing being referred to is underlined.):

- *They’re* the people ***who want to buy our house****.*
- *Here are* some cells ***which have been affected****.*
- *They should give the money* to somebody ***who they think needs the treatment most****.*
- \[talking about an actress\]
- *She’s now playing* a woman ***whose son was killed in the First World War****.*

Spoken English:

In defining relative clauses we often use *that* instead of *who, whom* or *which*. This is very common in informal speaking:

- *They’re* the people ***that*** *want to buy our house.*
- *Here are* some cells ***that*** *have been affected.*

### Subject or object

The relative pronoun can define the subject or the object of the verb:

- *They’re* the people ***who/that bought our house****.* (The people bought our house. *The people* is the subject.)
- *They’re* the people ***who/that she met at Jon’s party****.* (She met the people. *The people* is the object.)
- *Here are* some cells ***which/that show abnormality****.* (Some cells show abnormality. *Some cells* is the subject.)
- *Here are* some cells ***which/that the researcher has identified****.* (The researcher has identified some cells. *Some cells* is the object.)

### No relative pronoun

We often leave out the relative pronoun when it is the object of the verb:

- *They’re* the people ***she met at Jon’s party****.*
- *Here are* some cells ***the researcher has identified****.*

### Punctuation

:::warning

In writing, we don’t use commas in defining relative clauses:

- *This is a man who takes his responsibilities seriously.*
- Not: *~~This is a man, who takes his responsibilities seriously.~~*

:::

### Nouns and pronouns in relative clauses

When the relative pronoun is the subject of the relative clause, we don’t use another personal pronoun or noun in the relative clause because the subject (underlined) is the same:

- *She’s* the lady ***who*** ***lent*** *me her phone.* (*who* is the subject of the relative clause, so we don’t need the personal pronoun *she*)
- Not: *~~She’s the lady who she lent me her phone.~~*

- *There are now only* two schools in the area ***that*** *actually **teach** Latin.*
- (*that* is the subject of the relative clause, so we don’t need the personal pronoun *they*)
- Not: *~~There are now only two schools in the area that they actually teach Latin.~~*

When the relative pronoun is the object of the relative clause, we don’t use another personal pronoun or noun in the relative clause because the object (underlined) is the same:

- *We had a lovely meal at* the place ***which*** *Phil **recommended**.*
- (*which* is the object of the relative clause, so we don’t need the personal pronoun *it*)
- Not: *~~We had a lovely meal at the place which Phil recommended it.~~*

## Non-defining relative clauses

We use non-defining relative clauses to give extra information about the person or thing. It is not necessary information. We don’t need it to understand who or what is being referred to.

We always use a relative pronoun (*who, which, whose* or *whom*) to introduce a non-defining relative clause (In the examples, the relative clause is in bold, and the person or thing being referred to is underlined.)

- Clare*, **who I work with**, is doing the London marathon this year.*
- Not: *~~Clare, I work with, is doing the London marathon this year.~~*
- *Doctors use the testing kit for regular screening for* lung and stomach cancers*, **which account for 70% of cancers treated in the western world**.*
- Alice*, **who has worked in Brussels and London ever since leaving Edinburgh**, will be starting a teaching course in the autumn.*

:::warning

We don’t use *that* to introduce a non-defining relative clause:

- Allen*, **who scored three goals in the first game**, was the only player to perform well.*
- Not: *~~Allen, that scored three goals in the first game, was the only player to perform well.~~*

### Punctuation

In writing, we use commas around non-defining relative clauses:

- *Etheridge, **who is English-born with Irish parents**, replaces Neil Francis, **whose injury forced him to withdraw last week**.*

Spoken English:

In speaking, we often pause at the beginning and end of the clause:

- *Unlike American firms **– which typically supply all three big American car makers –** Japanese ones traditionally work exclusively with one maker.* (formal)
- *And this woman* ***– who I’d never met before – came up and spoke to me.*** (informal)

## Defining or non-defining relative clauses?

Sometimes defining and non-defining relative clauses can look very similar but have different meanings.

Some of these local charities help the homeless. There are other local charities as well as these.</td></tr></tbody></table>

:::warning

The information in a defining relative clause is essential, so we can’t leave out the relative clause. The information in a non-defining relative clause is extra information which isn’t essential, so we can leave out the relative clause.

:::warning

We can use *that* instead of *who, whom* or *which* in defining relative clauses, but not in non-defining relative clauses:

- *I think anyone **who** speaks in public is nervous beforehand.*
- *I think anyone **that** speaks in public is nervous beforehand.*
- *Her car, **which** was very old, broke down after just five miles.*
- Not: *~~Her car, that was very old, broke down after just five miles.~~*
