# Relative clauses: typical errors

When we use a relative pronoun as a subject in the relative clause, we don’t use a personal pronoun or noun:

- *That’s the school **that** does lots of music and drama.*
- Not: *~~That’s the school that it does lots of music and drama.~~*

When a relative pronoun is the object of the relative clause, we need a subject (pronoun or noun) in the relative clause:

- *They met at the gallery **that*** ***Jane** had talked about.*
- Not: *~~They met at the gallery that had talked about.~~*

When a relative pronoun is the object of the relative clause, we don’t need another object (pronoun or noun) in the relative clause:

- *They went to the same restaurant that Mark had been to.*
- Not: *~~They went to the same restaurant that Mark had been to it.~~*

In writing, we don’t use commas in defining relative clauses:

- *Sally is a committee member who finds it difficult to make decisions.*
- Not: *~~Sally is a committee member, who finds it difficult to make decisions.~~*
