# Reported speech: direct speech

Direct speech is a representation of the actual words someone said. A direct speech report usually has a reporting verb in the past simple. The most common reporting verb is *said*. The reporting clause may come first or second.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>reporting clause first</td><td>reported clause</td><td>reporting clause second</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Jimmy </i><b><i>said</i></b><i>,</i></td><td><i>‘Let me have a look.’</i></td><td><br/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Then the child </i><b><i>asked</i></b><i>,</i></td><td><i>‘Are there any toys?’</i></td><td><br/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><br/></td><td><i>‘Hand it over at once!’</i></td><td><i>he </i><b><i>demanded</i></b><i>.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><br/></td><td><i>‘I believe that too,’</i></td><td><i>she </i><b><i>added</i></b><i>.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

The reporting clause may sometimes come in the middle of the reported clause, especially in literary styles:

- *“No,” **she said**, “I’ve never seen it before.”*
- *‘Was it,’ **he asked**, ‘the first time you had spoken to Mrs Dalton?’*

We can use adverbs with the reporting verb to describe the way someone said something. This is more common when the reporting clause comes second:

- *“I will not accept it!” he said **angrily**.*
- *‘Can I speak to the doctor?’ she asked **rather nervously**.*

## Direct speech: inversion of subject and reporting verb

In narratives, especially novels and short stories, when the reporting clause comes second, we often invert the subject (s) and reporting verb (v):

- *“Things have always been the same in this village,” \[V\] **said** \[S\] **the old man**.*
- *‘Hold on! I’m coming!’ \[V\] **cried** \[S\] **Maurice**.*

## Direct speech: present simple and continuous reporting verbs

### Informal narratives

In informal conversation, we sometimes use the present simple in the reporting clause. This makes the direct speech more vivid and dramatic:

- *So then this guy **says**, “I’ve got something for you. Come over here.” And he picked up a box and he **says**, “Open that.”*

We can make the direct speech even more vivid and dramatic by using the present continuous. This is very informal:

- *And he’s looking at me and he**’s******asking**, “Who are you?” and I said, “I’m your nephew” and he**’s*** ***mumbling**, “I don’t know you. I’ve never seen you before in my life.”*

In very informal conversation, people sometimes use *says* as a reporting verb for all persons (*I, you, she, he, we, they*):

- ***She*** ***says****, ‘What’s going on here?’ and **I says**, ‘Nothing. There’s nothing happening – everything’s okay.’*

Many speakers consider the above examples to be incorrect. This applies especially to the use of *says* with all persons.

### Newspaper headlines

We also use the present simple in newspaper headlines. This makes the reported words more dramatic:

- *‘I WON’T RESIGN,’ **SAYS** MINISTER*

- *Go*
- *Like*
- *Say* or *tell*?
