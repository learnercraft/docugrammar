# Reported speech

Reported speech is how we represent the speech of other people or what we ourselves say. There are two main types of reported speech: direct speech and indirect speech.

Direct speech repeats the exact words the person used, or how we remember their words:

- *Barbara said,* ***“I didn’t realise it was midnight.”***

In indirect speech, the original speaker’s words are changed.

- *Barbara said **she hadn’t realised it was midnight**.*

In this example, *I* becomes *she* and the verb tense reflects the fact that time has passed since the words were spoken: *didn’t realise* becomes *hadn’t realised*.

Indirect speech focuses more on the content of what someone said rather than their exact words:

- ***“I’m sorry,”*** *said Mark.* (direct)
- *Mark **apologised**.* (indirect: report of a speech act)

In a similar way, we can report what people wrote or thought:

- ***‘I will love you forever,’*** *he wrote, and then posted the note through Alice’s door.* (direct report of what someone wrote)
- *He wrote **that*** ***he would love her forever**, and then posted the note through Alice’s door.* (indirect report of what someone wrote)
- ***I need a new direction in life****, she thought.* (direct report of someone’s thoughts)
- *She thought **that she needed a new direction in life**.* (indirect report of someone’s thoughts)

## Reported speech: reporting and reported clauses

Speech reports consist of two parts: the reporting clause and the reported clause. The reporting clause includes a verb such as *say, tell, ask, reply, shout*, usually in the past simple, and the reported clause includes what the original speaker said.

<table><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>reporting clause</td><td>reported clause</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>William </i><b><i>said</i></b><i>,</i></td><td><i>“I need your help.”</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Then a man </i><b><i>shouted</i></b><i>,</i></td><td><i>“Get out of there, fast!”</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>The postman </i><b><i>said</i></b></td><td><i>he had a package for us.</i></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><i>Clarissa </i><b><i>told</i></b><i> </i><b><i>me</i></b></td><td><i>she’s thinking of moving to Canada.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Reported speech: punctuation

### Direct speech

In direct speech we usually put a comma between the reporting clause and the reported clause. The words of the original speaker are enclosed in inverted commas, either single (‘…’) or double (“…”). If the reported clause comes first, we put the comma inside the inverted commas:

- ***“****I couldn’t sleep last night,**”**he said.*
- *Rita said, **‘**I don’t need you any more.****’***

If the direct speech is a question or exclamation, we use a question mark or exclamation mark, not a comma:

- *‘Is there a reason for this**?**’ she asked.*
- *“I hate you**!**” he shouted.*

We sometimes use a colon (:) between the reporting clause and the reported clause when the reporting clause is first:

- *The officer replied: ‘It is not possible to see the General. He’s busy.’*

### Indirect speech

:::warning

In indirect speech it is more common for the reporting clause to come first. When the reporting clause is first, we don’t put a comma between the reporting clause and the reported clause. When the reporting clause comes after the reported clause, we use a comma to separate the two parts:

- *She told me they had left her without any money.*
- Not: *~~She told me, they had left her without any money.~~*
- *Nobody had gone in or out during the previous hour, he informed us.*

:::warning

We don’t use question marks or exclamation marks in indirect reports of questions and exclamations:

- *He asked me why I was so upset.*
- Not: *~~He asked me why I was so upset?~~*

## Reported speech: reporting verbs

### Say and tell

We can use *say* and *tell* to report statements in direct speech, but *say* is more common. We don’t always mention the person being spoken to with *say*, but if we do mention them, we use a prepositional phrase with *to* (*to me, to Lorna*):

- *‘I’ll give you a ring tomorrow,’ she **said**.*
- *‘Try to stay calm,’ she **said to us** in a low voice.*
- Not: *~~‘Try to stay calm,’ she said us in a low voice.~~*

With *tell*, we always mention the person being spoken to; we use an indirect object (underlined):

- *‘Enjoy yourselves,’ he* ***told*** them*.*
- Not: *~~‘Enjoy yourselves,’ he told.~~*

In indirect speech, *say* and *tell* are both common as reporting verbs. We don’t use an indirect object with *say*, but we always use an indirect object (underlined) with *tell*:

- *He **said** he was moving to New Zealand.*
- Not: *~~He said me he was moving to New Zealand.~~*

- *He* ***told*** me *he was moving to New Zealand.*
- Not: *~~He told he was moving to New Zealand.~~*

We use *say*, but not *tell*, to report questions:

- *‘Are you going now?’ she **said**.*
- Not: *~~‘Are you going now?’ she told me.~~*

We use *say*, not *tell*, to report greetings, congratulations and other wishes:

- *‘Happy birthday!’ she **said**.*
- Not: *~~Happy birthday!’ she told me.~~*
- *Everyone **said** good luck to me as I went into the interview.*
- Not: *~~Everyone told me good luck~~* …

The reporting verbs in this list are more common in indirect reports, in both speaking and writing:

- *Simon **admitted** that he had forgotten to email Andrea.*
- *Louis always **maintains** that there is royal blood in his family.*
- *The builder **pointed out** that the roof was in very poor condition.*

Most of the verbs in the list are used in direct speech reports in written texts such as novels and newspaper reports. In ordinary conversation, we don’t use them in direct speech. The reporting clause usually comes second, but can sometimes come first:

- *‘Who is that person?’ she **asked**.*
- *‘It was my fault,’ he **confessed**.*
- *‘There is no cause for alarm,’ the Minister **insisted**.*
