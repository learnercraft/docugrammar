# Such as

We can use *such as* to introduce an example or examples of something we mention. We normally use a comma before *such as* when we present a list of examples. Where there is just one example, we don’t need a comma:

- *The shop specialises in tropical fruits, **such as** pineapples, mangoes and papayas.* (… for example, pineapples, mangoes and papayas.)
- *Countries **such as** Sweden have a long record of welcoming refugees from all over the world.*

*Such as* is similar to *like* for introducing examples, but it is more formal, and is used more in writing than *like*:

- *She has worked in several countries where English is spoken as a first language, **such as** Australia, New Zealand, Canada and so on.* (or, less formal, *… **like** Australia, New Zealand, Canada and so on*.)

:::warning

We don’t use *as* on its own to introduce examples:

- *Young kids these days seem to love 1960s rock bands, **such as** the Beatles, the Kinks or the Rolling Stones.*
- Not: … ~~to love 1960s rock bands, as the Beatles~~ …

:::warning

We don’t use *such as* when we compare things:

- *The group from Dublin all wore green, white or gold t-shirts, **like** the colours of their national flag.*
- Not: … ~~such as the colours of their national flag.~~
