# Word formation

There are four main kinds of word formation: prefixes, suffixes, conversion and compounds.

## Prefixes

We add prefixes before the base or stem of a word.

## Suffixes

We add suffixes after the base or stem of a word. The main purpose of a suffix is to show what class of word it is (e.g. noun or adjective).

## Conversion

Conversion involves the change of a word from one word class to another. For example, the verbs *to email* and *to microwave* are formed from the nouns *email* and *microwave*:

- *Can you **text** her?* (verb from noun *text*, meaning *to send a text-message*)
- *They are always **jetting** somewhere.* (verb from noun *jet*)
- *If you’re not careful, some **downloads** can damage your computer.* (noun from verb *download*)
- *OK, so the meeting’s on Tuesday. That’s a **definite**.* (noun from adjective)
- *It’s a very big **if** and I’m not at all sure we can afford it.* (noun from conjunction, meaning ‘it’s not at all certain’)
- *All companies have their **ups** and **downs**.* (nouns from prepositions)

We also use conversion when we change a proper noun into a common noun:

- *Has anybody seen my **Dickens**?* (copy of a book by Dickens)

## Compounding

When we use compounding, we link together two or more bases to create a new word. Normally, the first item identifies a key feature of the second word. For example, the two bases *back* and *ache* can combine to form the compound noun *backache*, and the two bases *post* and *card* combine to form the compound noun *postcard*.

Compounds are found in all word classes. The most common types of compounds are: Nouns: *car park, rock band*

- Adjectives: heartbreaking, sugar-free, airsick
- Verbs: oven-bake, baby-sit, chain-smoke
- Adverbs: good-naturedly, nevertheless

It is sometimes difficult to know where to put hyphens in words that are compound ed. It is also difficult to know whether to separate words (e.g. *post box*) or to join the words (e.g. *postbox*). In such cases, it is best to check in a good learner’s dictionary.

## Abbreviation

Abbreviation involves shortening a word. We do this in three main ways: clipping, acronyms and blends.

We use clipping when we shorten or ‘clip’ one or more syllables from a word. We also commonly clip proper names for people:

- *ad: advertisement, advert*
- *lab: laboratory*
- *Matt: Matthew*

Acronyms are a type of abbreviation formed when the initial letters of two or more words are combined in a way that produces consonant and vowel sequences found in words. Acronyms are normally pronounced as words:

- *RAM*: random access memory (*RAM* is a term used to describe a computer’s memory.)

Initials are similar to acronyms but are pronounced as sets of letters, not as words:

- *WHO*: ***W****orld **H**ealth **O**rganisation*, pronounced *W–H–O*
- *CD*: ***c****ompact **d**isc*, pronounced *C–D*

We form blends when we combine parts of existing words to form a new word:

- *blog*: blend of *we****b*** and ***log***
- *motel*: blend of ***mo****tor* and *ho****tel***
- *smog*: blend of ***sm****oke* and *f****og***

## Back-formation

We form words with back-formation when we remove part of a word, usually something which we think is a suffix (or occasionally a prefix). We do this commonly when we form verbs from nouns. For example: *to liaise* (back-formed from the noun *liaison*); *to intuit* (back-formed from the noun *intuition*), *to enthuse* (back-formed from the noun *enthusiasm*):

- *Can you **liaise** with Tim and agree a time for the meeting, please?*
- *She’s always **enthusing** about her new teacher.*

## Loan words and new words

### Loan words

Loan words are words that are borrowed from other languages. Some recent loan words for food taken from other languages include: *sushi, tapas, chapatti, pizza*.

When we use loan words, we do not normally change them, though we do sometimes inflect them if they are singular countable nouns (*pizzas, chapattis*). We also sometimes pronounce them more like English words, instead of using their original pronunciation.

### New words

Some prefixes are commonly used to create new words. In modern English the prefix *e-* is used to create new words that are connected with the Internet and the use of the Internet:

- *e-bank, e-cards, e-commerce, e-learning*

Almost any noun may potentially combine with any other noun to form new noun compounds (e.g. *computer virus*, *carbon footprint*, *quality time*).
