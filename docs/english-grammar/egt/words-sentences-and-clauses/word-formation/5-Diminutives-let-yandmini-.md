# Diminutives (-let, -y and mini-)

A diminutive creates a meaning of ‘small’ or ‘little’. The most common diminutives are formed with the prefix *mini*\- and with suffixes such as *\-let* and *\-y*. We often use a diminutive with names or with abbreviated names when we want to be more informal, or to express affection for someone or something:

- *There’s a **minibus** outside waiting to take you all to the station.* (minibus = a bus which is smaller than a standard bus)
- *Here’s a **booklet** which gives advice on keep-fit.* (*booklet* = a small book)
- *I can feel one or two **droplets** of rain.* (*droplet* = little drops of rain)
- *Right, **Matty**, I’ve got some very good news for you.* (*Matty* is formed from the name ‘Matthew’)
- *I think she’s the perfect **kitty** for Jennifer.* (*kitty* is formed from ‘kitten’ a young cat)

We sometimes use a diminutive -*y* when we don’t want or don’t need to be precise:

- *Her new dress was a sort of **bluey** colour.* (*bluey* = almost blue)
