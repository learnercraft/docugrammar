# Hyphens

Hyphens are a form of dash (-) which we use between words or parts of words.

We can use hyphens to make compound words, most commonly compound nouns:

- *French **lorry-drivers** have blockaded three ports.*

Compound nouns formed with prepositions and particles are also usually separated by hyphens:

- *Come and meet my **father-in-law**.*
- *Don’t wear too much **make-up** if you are planning to be in the sun.*

We use hyphens with compound verbs and with adverb + adjective compounds:

- *I’m phoning to ask if you can **baby-sit** for us this evening.*
- \[Labradors are a breed of dog.\]
- *It’s a **well-known** fact that Labradors have a very nice temperament.*

We often use hyphens to separate words and prefixes:

- *The **vice-president** will speak to the company on Monday.*
- *She met her **ex-husband** at a party last week.*

We also use hyphens to separate compound modifiers:

- *The oven was **red-hot** when she touched it.*
- *A **twelve-year-old** girl was found alone in the large house.*

We also sometimes use hyphens when we write out figures:

- *There were **sixty-eight** people who applied for the job.*
- ***Three-quarters*** *of the voters did not reply to the questionnaire.*

However, hyphens are becoming less common and people often write several of the above words without hyphens or do not separate compound words at all. A common word with a hyphen such as *post-box* will also be seen as *post box* and *postbox*.

It is important to check the spelling of compound words in a good learner’s dictionary.
