# Inversion

Inversion happens when we reverse (invert) the normal word order of a structure, most commonly the subject-verb word order. For example, a statement has the subject (s) before the verb (v), but to make question word order, we invert the subject and the verb, with an auxiliary (aux) or modal verb (m) before the subject (s):

- *\[S\] She \[V\] sings.*
- *\[AUX\] Does \[S\] she \[V\] sing?*
- *\[S\] They \[AUX\] are \[V\] working.*
- *\[AUX\] Are \[S\] they \[V\] working?*
- *\[S\] Joe \[M\] can \[V\] swim.*
- *\[M\] Can \[S\] Joe \[V\] swim?*

## When does inversion happen?

The most common type of inversion is question word order (see above). Inversion also happens in other situations.

### Negative adverbs

In formal styles, when we use an adverb with negative meaning (e.g. *never, seldom, rarely, scarcely, hardly*) in front position for emphasis, we invert the subject (s) and auxiliary (aux)/modal verb:

- ***Never*** *\[AUX\] **have** \[S\] **we** witnessed such cruel behaviour by one child to another.* (or *We have never witnessed* …)
- ***Seldom*** ***does one hear*** *a politician say ‘sorry’.* (or *One seldom hears* …)

### Expressions beginning with not

We also invert the subject and verb after *not* + a prepositional phrase or a clause in initial position:

- ***Not for a moment did I*** *think I would be offered the job, so I was amazed when I got it.*
- ***Not till I got home did I*** *realise my wallet was missing.*

### Here and there

Inversion can happen after *here*, and after *there* when it is as an adverb of place. After *here* and *there*, we can use a main verb without an auxiliary verb or modal verb:

- ***Here*** *comes the bus!*
- ***Here’s*** *your coffee.*
- *I opened the door and **there stood Michael**, all covered in mud.*
- *She looked out and **there*** ***was Pamela**, walking along arm in arm with Goldie.*
