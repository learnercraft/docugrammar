# Not only … but also

We use *not only X but also* *Y* in formal contexts:

- *The war caused **not only** destruction and death **but also** generations of hatred between the two communities.*
- *The car **not only** is economical **but also** feels good to drive.*
- *This investigation is **not only** one that is continuing and worldwide **but also** one that we expect to continue for quite some time.*

We can sometimes leave out *also*:

- *I identified with Denzel Washington **not only** as an actor **but** as a person.*

To add emphasis, we can use *not only* at the beginning of a clause. When we do this, we invert the subject and the verb:

- ***Not only*** *was it raining all day at the wedding **but also** the band was late.*
- ***Not only*** *will they paint the outside of the house **but also** the inside.*

When there is no auxiliary verb or main verb *be*, we use *do, does, did*:

- ***Not only*** *did she forget my birthday, **but** she **also** didn’t even apologise for forgetting it.*
