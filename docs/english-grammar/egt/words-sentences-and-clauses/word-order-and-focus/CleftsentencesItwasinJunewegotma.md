# Cleft sentences (It was in June we got married.)

We use cleft sentences, especially in speaking, to connect what is already understood to what is new to the listener. In a cleft sentence, a single message is divided (cleft) into two clauses. This allows us to focus on the new information.

## It-cleft sentences

*It*\-clauses are the most common type of cleft clause. The information that comes after *it* is emphasised for the listener. The clause which follows the *it-*clause is connected using *that* and it contains information that is already understood. We often omit *that* in informal situations when it is the object of the verb:

- A: *Sharon’s car got broken into yesterday, did it?*
- B: *No. It was* ***Nina’s car*** ***that got broken into!***
- Focus (new information): it was Nina’s car
- Understood already (old information): a car got broken into
- A: *You’ve met my mother, haven’t you?*
- B: *No, it was* ***your sister (that) I met!***
- Focus (new information): it was your sister
- Understood already (old information): I met someone in your family

- *Is it **August** that you are going on holiday?*
- Focus (new information): the month August?
- Understood already (old information): you are going on holiday

When a personal subject is the focus, we can use *who* instead of *that*. We often omit *who* in informal situations when it is the object of the verb:

- *It was my **husband who** (or that) you spoke to on the phone.* (or *It was my husband you spoke to on the phone*.)

When a plural subject is the focus, we use a plural verb but *It* + *be* remains singular:

- *It’**s** the **parents** who **were** protesting most.*

We can use negative structures in the *it-*clause:

- ***It wasn’t*** *the Greek student who phoned.*

## Wh-cleft sentences (What I need is a holiday)

*Wh-*cleft sentences are most often introduced by *what*, but we can also use *why, where, how*, etc. The information in the *wh*\-clause is typically old or understood information, while the information in the following clause is new and in focus:

- A: *I don’t know what to cook for them? I don’t know what they like*.
- B: ***What*** *they like is* ***smoked salmon***.
- Understood already (old information): we are talking about what they like to eat
- Focus (new information): they like smoked salmon
- A: *This remote control isn’t working*.
- B: ***What*** *we need to do is* ***get new batteries for it***.
- Understood already (old information): there is something that we need to do to fix the remote control.
- Focus (new information): we need to buy new batteries
