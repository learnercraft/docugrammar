# Introduction

English has a large class of adjectives which can express a variety of meanings: classification, description, evaluation and many other ideas. Most European languages, and many others, have similar classes of adjectives. Some of the world’s languages, however, have few if any adjectives. In such languages the relevant ideas might be expressed by using nouns or verbs; so the equivalent of, for example, *She’s angry* could be something corresponding to ‘She has anger’ or ‘She rages’.

English adjectives are relatively easy to use, since (except for comparatives and superlatives, [*Comparison*)](../comparison/comparison-introduction) an adjective can only have one possible form. There are some complications of position and word order: these and a few other points are covered in the following entries.
