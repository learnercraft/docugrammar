# Adjectives: position after *as*, *how*, *so*, *too*

After *as*, *how*, *so*, *too* and *this/that* meaning *so*, adjectives go before *a/an*. This structure is common in a formal style.

:::tip[Grammar]

*as/how/so/too/this/that* + adjective + *a/an* + noun

:::

- *I have **as good a voice** as you.*
- ***How good a pianist*** *is he?*
- *She is **too polite a person** to refuse.*
- *I couldn't afford **that big a car**.*
- *It was **so warm a day** that I could hardly work.*

The structure is not possible without *a/an*.

- *I like your country -- it's so beautiful.* (not *~~I like your so beautiful country.~~*)
- *Those girls are too kind to refuse.* (not *~~They are too kind girls to refuse.~~*)

:::note

For the structure with adjective + *as* in expressions like *tired as I was ...*, [(see here)](./../other-adverbial-clauses/as-and-though-special-word-order).
