# Adjectives without nouns

We cannot usually leave out a noun after an adjective.

- *Poor **little boy**!* (not *~~Poor little!~~*)
- *The most **important thing** is to be happy.* (not *~~The most important is …~~*)

But there are some exceptions.

## Well-known groups: *the old*; *the poor*

*The* + adjective is used to talk about certain well-known groups of people who are in a particular physical or social condition. Common expressions:

- *the blind*
- *the dead*
- *the deaf*
- *the disabled*
- *the handicapped*
- *the jobless*
- *the mentally ill*
- *the old*
- *the poor*
- *the rich*
- *the unemployed*
- *the young*

The term *handicapped* is now often considered offensive; people with physical disabilities generally prefer the adjective *disabled*.

- *He’s collecting money for **the blind**.*
- ***The unemployed** are losing hope.*

The meaning is usually general; occasionally a limited group is referred to.

- *After the accident, **the injured** were taken to hospital.*

These expressions are normally plural: *the dead* means ‘all dead people’ or ‘the dead people’, but not ‘the dead person’.

- ***The dead have** no further worries.* (but not *~~The dead has …~~*)

Note that these expressions cannot be used with a possessive ’*s*.

- *the problems of **the poor*** ``or`` ***poor people’s** problems* (not *~~the poor’s problems~~*)

Adjectives are normally only used in this way with *the* or a determiner.

- *This government doesn’t care about **the poor**.* (not *~~… about poor.~~*)
- *There are **more unemployed** than ever before.*

However, adjectives without *the* are sometimes used in paired structures with *both … and* …

- *opportunities for **both rich and poor***

## Adjectives of nationality: *the Irish*; *the Dutch*

A few adjectives of nationality ending in *\-sh* or *\-ch* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/vocabulary-areas/nationalities-countries-and-regions#exceptions) are used after *the* without nouns. They include *Irish*, *Welsh*, *English*, *British*, *Spanish*, *Dutch*, *French*.

- ***The Irish** are very proud of their sense of humour.*

These expressions are plural; singular equivalents are for example *an Irishwoman*, *a Welshman* (not *~~a Welsh~~*).

Where nouns exist, these are preferred to expressions with *the …ish*: we say ***the Danes*** or ***the Turks*** (not *~~the Danish~~* or *~~the Turkish~~*).

## Singular examples: *the accused*

In a few formal fixed phrases, *the* + adjective can have a singular meaning. These include *the accused*, *the undersigned*, *the deceased*, *the former* and *the latter*.

- ***The accused** was released on bail.*
- *… Stephen Gray and Susan Cook; **the latter** is a well-known designer.*

## Abstract ideas: *the supernatural*

Adjectives are sometimes used after *the* to refer to general abstract ideas, especially in philosophical writing. (Examples: *the beautiful*, *the supernatural*, *the unreal*.) These expressions are singular.

- *She’s interested in **the supernatural**.*
- ***The difficult** we do immediately; **the impossible takes** a little longer.*

## Choices: *White or brown?*

We sometimes leave out a noun that has already been mentioned, or which does not need to be mentioned, when thinking about a choice between two or more different kinds of thing.

- *‘Have you got any bread?’ ‘Do you want **white** or **brown**?’*
- *I’d like two large packets and one **small**.*

Colour adjectives can sometimes have a plural *\-s* in this situation, effectively becoming nouns.

- *Wash **the reds** and **blues** separately.* (= red and blue clothes)

## Superlatives: *We bought the cheapest.*

Nouns are often left out after superlative adjectives.

- *I’m **the tallest** in my family.*
- *We bought **the cheapest**.*
