# Pronunciation of aged, naked, etc

A few adjectives ending in *\-ed* have a special pronunciation: the last syllable is pronounced /ɪd/ instead of /d/ or /t/ [(see here)](./../past-and-perfect-tenses/simple-past#pronunciation-of--ed).

- *aged* /ˈeɪdʒɪd/ (= very old)
- *beloved* /bɪˈlʌvɪd/
- *crooked* /ˈkrʊkɪd/
- *cursed* /ˈkɜːsɪd/
- *naked* /ˈneɪkɪd/
- *ragged* /ˈrægɪd/
- *rugged* /ˈrʌgɪd/
- *blessed* /ˈblesɪd/
- *dogged* /ˈdɒgɪd/
- *learned* /ˈlɜːnɪd/
- *sacred* /ˈseɪkrɪd/
- *wicked* /ˈwɪkɪd/
- *wretched* /ˈretʃɪd/
- *one/three/four-legged* /ˈlegɪd/

Note that *aged* is pronounced /eɪdʒd/ when it means ‘years old’ (as in *He has a daughter aged ten*), or when it is a verb.
