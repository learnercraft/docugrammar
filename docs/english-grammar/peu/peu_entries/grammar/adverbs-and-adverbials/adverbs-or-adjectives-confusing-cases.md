# Adverbs or adjectives: confusing cases

## Adjectives ending in *-ly*: *friendly*, *lively*

Some words ending in *\-ly* are adjectives, and not normally adverbs. Common examples: *costly*, *cowardly*, *deadly*, *friendly*, *likely*, *lively*, *lonely*, *lovely*, *silly*, *ugly*, *unlikely*.

- *She gave me a **friendly** smile.*
- *Her singing was **lovely**.*

There are no adverbs *friendly/friendlily*, *lovely/lovelily*, etc.

- *She smiled **in a friendly way**.* (not *~~She smiled friendly.~~*)
- *He **gave a silly laugh**.* (not *~~He laughed silly.~~*)

*Daily*, *weekly*, *monthly*, *yearly*, *early* and *leisurely* are both adjectives and adverbs.

- *It’s a **daily** paper.*
- *It comes out **daily**.*
- *an **early** train*
- *I got up **early**.*

## Adjectives and adverbs with the same form; adverbs with two forms

Some adjectives and adverbs have the same form: for example, a *fast* car goes *fast*; if you do *hard* work, you work *hard*. In other cases, the adverb may have two forms (e.g. *late* and *lately*), one like the adjective and the other with *\-ly*. There is usually a difference of meaning or use. Some examples follow; for more detailed information, check in a good dictionary.

The adverb *dead* is used in certain expressions to mean ‘exactly’, ‘completely’ or ‘very’. Examples: *dead ahead*, *dead certain*, *dead drunk*, *dead right*, *dead slow*, *dead straight*, *dead sure*, *dead tired.*
