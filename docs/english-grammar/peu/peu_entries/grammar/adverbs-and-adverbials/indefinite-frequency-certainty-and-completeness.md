# Indefinite frequency, certainty and completeness

Adverbials in this group most often go in mid-position (before a one-part verb and after an auxiliary verb – for more exact details, [(see here)](./mid-position-details).

## Adverbials of indefinite frequency: *usually*, *often*, etc

:::tip[Examples]

*usually*, *normally*, *often*, *frequently*, *sometimes*, *occasionally*, *always*, *rarely*, *ever*, *hardly ever*, *seldom*, *never*

:::

- *We **usually** go to Scotland in August.*
- *It **sometimes** gets very windy here.*
- *I have **never** seen a whale.*
- *You can **always** come and stay with us if you want to.*
- *Have you **ever** played American football?*
- *My boss is **often** bad-tempered.*
- *I’m **seldom** late for work.*
- *We have **never** been invited to one of their parties.*
- *She must **sometimes** have wanted to run away.*

Other positions are possible for most of them.

- ***Sometimes** I think I’d like to live somewhere else.*
- *I see her **occasionally**.*

*Always*, *ever*, *rarely*, *seldom* and *never* cannot normally go in front position.

- *I **always/never** get up early.* (not *~~Always/Never I get up early.~~*)

However, *always* and *never* can begin imperative clauses.

- ***Always** look in the mirror before starting to drive.*
- ***Never** ask her about her marriage.*

:::note

For *rarely*, *seldom*, *never*, *hardly* and *scarcely* in front position before verb + subject (‘inversion’), [(see here)](./../information-structure/inversion-auxiliary-verb-before-subject#after-negative-and-restrictive-expressions-at-no-time-was-he-).

:::

## Adverbials of certainty: *probably*, *certainly*, etc

:::tip[Examples]

*probably*, *certainly*, *definitely*, *clearly*, *obviously*

:::

- *He **probably** thinks you don’t like him.*
- *It will **certainly** rain this evening.*
- *There is **clearly** something wrong.*
- *I **definitely** feel better today.*
- *The train has **obviously** been delayed.*

*Maybe* and *perhaps* usually come at the beginning of a clause.

- ***Maybe** I’m right and **maybe** I’m wrong.*
- ***Perhaps** her train is late.*

## Adverbials of completeness: *practically*, *partly*, etc

:::tip[Examples]

*completely*, *practically*, *almost*, *nearly*, *quite*, *rather*, *partly*, *sort of*, *kind of*, *more or less*, *hardly*, *scarcely*

:::

- *I have **completely** forgotten your name.*
- *Sophie can **practically** read.*
- *It was **almost** dark.*
- *I **kind of** hope she wins.*
- *It **hardly** matters.*

Adverbials of completeness usually follow all auxiliary verbs.

- *I **will have completely** finished by next June.* (not *~~I will completely have finished …~~*)
- *Do you think the repair **has been properly** done?*

## Longer adverbials: *from time to time*, etc

Longer adverbials do not usually go in mid-position. Compare:

- *I **sometimes** visit my old school.*
- *I visit my old school **from time to time**.* (not *~~I from time to time visit …~~*)
