# Mid-position: details

## What exactly is mid-position?

Mid-position adverbials usually go before one-word verbs (e.g. *play*, *won*). If a verb has more than one part (e.g. *has written*, *was trying*), they normally go after the auxiliary. And they go after *am/are/is/was/were*.

## Before one-word verbs

- *I **always play** tennis on Saturdays.* (not *~~I play always tennis …~~*)
- *It **certainly looks** like rain.*
- *We **nearly won** the match.*

## After auxiliary verbs

- *She **has never** written to me.* (not usually *She never has written to me.*)
- *He **was definitely** trying to get into the house.*
- *The train **will probably** be late.*
- *You **can almost** see the sea from here.*

## After *am/are/is/was/were*

- *She **was always** kind to me.* (not usually *~~She always was kind to me.~~*)
- *It **is probably** too late now.*
- *I **am obviously** not welcome here.*

When there are two or more auxiliaries, the adverbial usually goes after the first.

- *You **have definitely been** working too hard.*
- *She **would never have been** promoted if she hadn’t changed jobs.*

When an auxiliary verb is used alone instead of a complete verb phrase [(see here)](./../information-structure/ellipsis-after-auxiliary-verbs), a mid-position adverbial comes before it.

- *‘Are you working?’ ‘I **certainly am**.’*
- *I don’t trust politicians. I **never have**, and I **never will**.*

## Mid-position (details): adverbials with negative verbs

In negative sentences, adverbials generally come before *not* if they emphasise the negative; otherwise they come after. Compare:

- *I **certainly do not** agree.*
- *I **do not often** have headaches.*

Both positions are possible with some adverbials, often with a difference of meaning. Compare:

- *I **don’t really** like her.* (mild dislike)
- *I **really don’t** like her.* (strong dislike)

When adverbials come before *not*, they may also come before the first auxiliary verb; they always come before *do*.

- *I **probably will not** be there.* (or *I **will probably not** be there.*)
- *He **probably does not** know.* (not *~~He does probably not know.~~*)

Only one position is possible before a contracted negative.

- *I **probably won’t** be there.*

## Mid-position (details): adverbials with emphatic verbs

When we emphasise auxiliary verbs or *am/are/is/was/were*, we put most mid-position adverbials before them instead of after. Compare:

- *She **has certainly** made him angry.*  
  *She **certainly ``HAS``** made him angry!*
- *Polite people **always say** thank-you.*  
  *Yes, well, I **always ``DO``** say thank-you.*
- *I’**m really sorry**.*  
  *I **really ``AM``** sorry.*

## Mid-position (details): American English

In American English [(see here)](./../varieties-of-english/american-and-british-english), mid-position adverbials are often put before auxiliary verbs and *am/are/is/was/were*, even when the verb is not emphasised, especially in an informal style. Compare:

- *He *has probably* arrived by now.* (normal in both AmE and BrE)
- *He *probably has* arrived by now.* (also normal in AmE; emphatic in BrE)

As an extreme example, here are four sentences in a journalistic style taken from an American newspaper article on crime in Britain. The most normal British equivalents are given in brackets.

- *‘Britain **long has been** known as a land of law and order.’* (BrE *Britain **has long been** known …*)
- *‘… but it **probably will** lead to a vote …’* (BrE … *but it **will probably** lead …*)
- *‘… the Labor Party **often has** criticized police actions.’* (BrE *… the Labour Party **has often** criticised …*)
- *‘… he **ultimately was** responsible for the treatment …’* (BrE … *he **was ultimately** responsible …*)
