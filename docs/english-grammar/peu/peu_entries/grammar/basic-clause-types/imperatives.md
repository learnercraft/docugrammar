# Imperatives

## Forms and use

In sentences like *Come here*, *Be quiet*, *Have a drink* or *Don’t worry about it*, the verb forms *come*, *be*, *have* and *don’t worry* are called ‘**imperatives**’. Affirmative imperatives have the same form as the infinitive without *to*; negative imperatives are constructed with *do* *not* (*don’t*).

Imperatives are used, for example, to tell or ask people to do things, to make suggestions, to give advice or instructions, to encourage and offer, and to express wishes for people’s welfare.

- ***Look** in the mirror before you drive off.*
- *Please **do not lean** out of the window.*
- ***Tell** him you’re not free this evening.*
- ***Try** again – you nearly did it.*
- ***Have** some more tea.*
- ***Enjoy** your break.*

An imperative followed by *and* or *or* can mean the same as an *if*\-clause.

- ***Walk** down our street any day **and** you’ll see kids playing.* (= If you walk …)
- ***Shut up or** I’ll lose my temper.* (= If you don’t shut up …)
- ***Don’t do** that again **or** you’ll be in trouble.*

## Emphatic imperative: *Do sit down.*

We can make an emphatic imperative with *do* (mainly BrE).

- ***Do sit** down.*
- ***Do be** more careful.*
- ***Do forgive** me.*

## Passive imperative: *Get vaccinated.*

To tell people to arrange for things to be done to them, we often use *get* + past participle.

- ***Get vaccinated** as soon as you can.*

## *do(n’t) be*

Although *do* is not normally used as an auxiliary with *be* [(see here)](./../be-have-and-do/be-with-auxiliary-do), this happens in negative imperatives.

- ***Don’t be** silly!*

*Do be* can begin emphatic imperatives.

- ***Do be** quiet!*

## Subject with imperative: *Somebody answer the phone.*

The imperative does not usually have a subject, but we can use a noun or pronoun to make it clear who we are speaking to.

- ***Emily come** here – **everybody else stay** where you are.*
- ***Somebody answer** the phone.*
- ***Relax**, **everybody**.*

*You* before an imperative can suggest emphatic persuasion or anger.

- ***You** just **sit down** and relax for a bit.*
- ***You take** your hands off me!*

Note the word order in negative imperatives with pronoun subjects.

- ***Don’t you** believe it.* (not *~~You don’t believe it.~~*)
- ***Don’t anybody** say a word.* (not *~~Anybody don’t say …~~*)

## Question tags

After imperatives, common question tags ( [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/question-tags-basic-information) are *will you?*, *would you?*, *can you?* and *could you?*

- *Give me a hand, **will you**?*
- *Wait here for a minute, **would you**?*
- *Get me something to drink, **can you?***

*Can’t you* and *won’t you* are more emphatic.

- *Be quiet, **can’t you**?*
- *Sit down, **won’t you?***

After negative imperatives, *will you*? is used.

- *Don’t tell anybody, **will you**?*

## Word order with *always* and *never*

*Always* and *never* come before imperatives.

- ***Always remember** what I told you.* (not *~~Remember always …~~*)
- ***Never speak** to me like that again.*
