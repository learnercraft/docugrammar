# *let* introducing imperatives

English verbs do not have a first-person imperative (used to suggest that *I* or *we* should do something), or a third-person imperative (for other people besides the hearer). However, *let* can be used to construct a type of imperative.

## First person plural imperative: *let’s …*

We can use *let us* (formal) or *let’s* (informal) to make suggestions or to give orders to a group that includes the speaker.

- ***Let us** pray.*
- ***Let’s** have a drink.*
- *OK, **let’s** all get moving.*

*Shall we?* is used as a question tag ( [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/question-tags-basic-information) in British English for *Let’s*; *let’s* can be used as a short answer.

- *‘Let’s go for a walk, **shall we**?’ ‘Yes, **let’s**.’*

Negatives are *let us not* / *do not let us* (formal); *let’s not* / *don’t let’s* (informal).

- ***Let us not** despair.* (formal)
- ***Do not let us** forget those who came before us.* (formal)
- ***Let’s not** get angry.* (informal)
- ***Don’t let’s** stay up too late tonight.* (informal)

## First person singular imperative: *let me …*

*Let me* is used to ‘give instructions to oneself’; the expressions *Let me see* and *Let me think* are very common.

- *‘What time shall we leave?’ ‘**Let me think**. Yes, eight o’clock will be OK.’*
- *What’s the best way to Manchester? **Let me see** – suppose I take the M6.*
- ***Let me** just get my coat and I’ll be with you.*

In a very informal style, *let’s* is often used to mean *let me* (also [(see here)](./../pronouns/personal-pronouns-advanced-points#us-meaning-me).

- ***Let’s** see. Suppose I take the M6 …*

## Third-person imperative: *let him …*

*Let* can also introduce a suggestion or order for someone or something else, not the speaker or hearer. This is common in formal and ceremonial language, but informal uses are also possible.

- ***Let** the prayers begin.*
- ***Let** our enemies understand that we will not hesitate to defend our territory.*
- *‘Your boyfriend’s going out with another girl.’ ‘**Let him**. I don’t care.’*

Note the structure with *let* + the infinitive of *there is*.

- ***Let there be** no doubt in your minds about our intentions.*
