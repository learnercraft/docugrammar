# Negative questions

## Structure: *Doesn’t she understand?* / *Does she not understand?*

Contracted and uncontracted negative questions have different word order. (Uncontracted negative questions are usually formal.)

:::tip[Grammar]

auxiliary verb + *n’t* + subject …

:::

- ***Doesn’t she** understand?*
- *Why **haven’t you** reserved your flight yet?*

:::tip[Grammar]

auxiliary verb + subject + *not* …

:::

- ***Does she not** understand?*
- *Why **have you not** reserved the flight yet?*

Non-auxiliary *have* (in British English) and *be* go in the same position as auxiliary verbs.

- ***Hasn’t she** any friends to help her?*
- ***Have they not** at least a room to stay in?*
- ***Aren’t you** ready?*
- ***Is Mrs Allen not** at home?*

## Two meanings

Negative questions can have two different kinds of meaning. It is usually clear from the situation and context which kind of question is being asked.

## ‘It’s true that …, isn’t it?’

A negative question can ask for confirmation of a positive belief. In this case the question expects the answer *Yes*, and means ‘It’s true that …, isn’t it?’

- ***Didn’t you** go and see Ella yesterday? How is she?* (= I believe you went and saw Ella yesterday …)

Expressions of opinion and suggestions can be made less definite by expressing them as negative questions (so that they ask for agreement).

- ***Wouldn’t it** be better to switch the lights on?*

Negative questions of this kind are common in exclamations [(see here)](./exclamations) and rhetorical questions [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/rhetorical-questions-who-cares).

- ***Isn’t it** a lovely day!*
- *‘She’s growing up to be a lovely person.’ ‘Yes, **isn’t she**!’*
- ***Isn’t the answer** obvious?* (= Of course the answer is obvious.)

## ‘Is it true that … not …?’

A negative question can also ask for confirmation of a negative belief. In this case the question expects the answer *No*, and means ‘Is it true that … not …?’

- ***Don’t you** feel well?* (= Am I right in thinking you don’t feel well?)
- *Oh, dear. **Can’t they** come this evening?*

This kind of negative question can show that the speaker is surprised that something has not happened or is not happening.

- ***Hasn’t the mail** come yet?*
- ***Didn’t the alarm** go off? I wonder what’s wrong with it.*

## Polite requests, invitations, offers, complaints and criticisms

Pressing invitations and offers often begin *Won’t you …?*, *Wouldn’t you …?* or *Why don’t you …?*

- ***Won’t you** come in for a few minutes?*
- ***Wouldn’t you** like something to drink?*
- ***Why don’t you** come and spend the weekend with us?*

*Why don’t you …?* can also introduce aggressive suggestions.

- ***Why don’t you** shut up?*

But in other cases we do not usually use negative questions to ask people to do things. This is done with ordinary questions, or with negative statement + question tag (especially British English).

- *Excuse me, **can you** help me for a moment?* (ordinary question, used as a request)
- ***You can’t** help me for a moment, **can you**?* (negative statement + question tag, common in informal requests)
- but not *~~Can’t you help me for a moment?~~*

Negative questions may be understood as complaints or criticisms.

- ***Can’t you** lend me your pen for a minute?* (= something like ‘Are you too selfish to lend me …?’)
- ***Don’t you** ever listen to what I say?*

## *yes* and *no*

In a reply to a negative question, *Yes* suggests an affirmative verb, and *No* suggests a negative verb. Compare:

- *‘Haven’t you written to Emily?’ ‘**Yes**.’  (= I have written to her.)*  
  *‘Haven’t you told her about us?’ ‘**No**.’* (= I haven’t told her about us.)
- *‘Didn’t Dan call this morning?’ ‘**Yes**, he did.’*  
  *‘Didn’t he give you a message for me?’ ‘**No**, he didn’t.’*
