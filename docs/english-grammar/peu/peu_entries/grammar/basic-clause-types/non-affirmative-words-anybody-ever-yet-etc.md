# Non-affirmative words: anybody, ever, yet, etc

There are some words that are not often used in affirmative sentences – for example *any*, *anybody*, *ever*, *yet*. When we affirm or assert (that is, when we say that something is true) we normally use other words – for example *some*, *somebody*, *once*, *sometimes*, *already*. Compare:

- ***Somebody** telephoned.*  
  *Did **anybody** telephone?*
- *I’ve bought you **something**.*  
  *I haven’t bought you **anything**.*
- *She’s **already** here.*  
  *Is she here **yet**?*
- *I **sometimes** go to the theatre.*  
  *Do you **ever** go to the theatre?*
- *I met the Prime Minister **once**.*  
  *Have you **ever** met the Prime Minister?*

Non-affirmative words are common not only in questions and negative sentences, but in other cases where we are not making affirmative statements – for example in *if*\-clauses, after comparisons, and together with adverbs, verbs, prepositions, adjectives and determiners that have a negative kind of meaning.

- *Let me know **if** you have **any** trouble.*
- *I wonder **if** she found **anything**.*
- *She writes **better** than **anybody** I know.*
- *He **seldom** says **anything**.*
- *I’ve **hardly** been **anywhere** since Christmas.*
- *He **denied** that he had **ever** seen her.*
- *Please **forget** that I **ever** told you **anything** about it.*
- *I’d rather do it **without anybody**’s help.*
- *It’s **difficult** to understand **anything** he says.*
- ***Few** people have **ever** seen her laugh.*
