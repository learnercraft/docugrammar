# Introduction

These three verbs live a double life. They can be **auxiliary verbs** used to form questions, negatives, emphatic forms, perfect and progressive tenses, and passives. *Be* can also be a **linking verb**, and *have* and *do* can be ordinary full verbs. For this reason, each of them can appear twice in a single phrase.

- *I **am being** served.*
- ***Have*** *you **had** an invitation?*
- *What **do** you **do**?*

There are some grammatical complications, particularly as regards *have*. For details, see the following entries.
