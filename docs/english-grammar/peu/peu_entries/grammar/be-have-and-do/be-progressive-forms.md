# *be*: progressive forms

:::tip[Grammar]
*I am being* / *you are being*, etc + adjective/noun
:::

We can use this structure to talk about temporary situations to do with actions and behaviour, but not usually to talk about feelings. Compare:

- *You’**re being** stupid.* (= You’re doing stupid things.)  
  *I **was being** very careful.* (= I was doing something carefully.)  
  *Who’**s being** a silly baby, then?*
- *I’**m** happy at the moment.* (not *I’m being happy at the moment.*)  
  *I **was** depressed when you phoned.* (not *I was being depressed ...*)

Note the difference between *He’s being sick* (BrE = He’s vomiting -- bringing food up from the stomach) and *He’s sick* (= He’s ill).
