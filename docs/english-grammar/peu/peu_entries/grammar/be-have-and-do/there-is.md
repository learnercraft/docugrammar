# *there is*

## Use

In sentences which say that something exists (or does not exist) somewhere, we usually use *there* as a kind of preparatory subject, and put the real subject after the verb. Note the pronunciation of *there*: usually /ðə(r)/, not /ðeə(r)/.

- ***There**’s a hole in my sleeve.* (More natural than *A hole is in my sleeve.*)
- ***There**’s ice on the lake.* (More natural than *Ice is on the lake.*)

*It* cannot be used in this way.

- ***There*** *is a lot of noise in the street.* (not *~~It is a lot of noise in the street.~~*)

*There are* is used with plural subjects.

- *I don’t know how many people **there are** in the waiting room.* (not *... ~~how many people there is~~ ...*)

However, *there’s* can begin sentences with plural subjects in informal speech.

- ***There’s two men*** *at the door, Dad.*
- ***There’s some grapes*** *in the fridge, if you’re still hungry.*

## Indefinite subjects

We use *there* in this way particularly with subjects that have indefinite articles, no article, or indefinite determiners like *some*, *any*, *no*; and with indefinite pronouns like *somebody*, *nothing*.

- *There are **some people** outside.*
- *There were **no footsteps** to be seen.*
- *There’s **something** worrying me.*
- *Is there **anybody** at home?*
- *There was **dancing** in the streets.*

Note the use of *wrong* and *the matter* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/the-matter-with).

- *There’s something **wrong**.*
- *Is there anything **the matter**?*

Note also the structures with *sense*, *point*, *use* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/any-and-no-adverbs) and *need*.

- *There’s **no sense** in making him angry.*
- *Is there **any point** in talking about it again?*
- *Do you think there’s **any use** trying to explain?*
- *There’s **no need** to hurry—we’ve got plenty of time.*

## All tenses

*There* can be used in this way with all tenses of *be*.

- *Once upon a time **there were** three wicked brothers.*
- ***There has*** *never **been** anybody like you.*
- ***There will be*** *snow later in the week.*

And *there* can be used in question tags [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/question-tags-advanced-points#theres--isnt-there).

- *There’ll be enough for everybody, **won’t there?***

## Structures with auxiliary *be*

*There* can also be used in structures where *be* is a progressive or passive auxiliary. Note the word order.

- ***There was*** *a girl **swimming** in the lake.* (= A girl was swimming ...) (not *~~There was swimming a girl~~ ...*)
- ***There have been*** *more Americans **killed** in road accidents than in all the wars since 1900.* (= More Americans have been killed ...) (not *~~There have been killed more Americans~~...*)
- ***There’ll be*** *somebody **meeting** you at the airport.*

## More complex structures

*There* can be used with **modal verb + *be***, and with some other verbs (e.g. *seem*, *appear*, *happen*, *tend*) before *to be*.

- ***There might be*** *drinks if you wait for a bit.*
- ***There must be*** *something we can do.*
- *If the police hadn’t closed the road, **there could have been** a bad accident.*
- ***There seem to be*** *some problems.* (not *~~There seems to be~~ ...*)
- *Could you be quiet? **There happens to be** a lecture going on.*
- ***There tends to be*** *jealousy when a new little brother or sister comes along.*

Note also the structure *there is*/*are* *certain*/*sure*/*likely*/*bound to be*.

- ***There is sure to be*** *trouble when she gets his message.*
- *Do you think **there are likely to be** delays?*

Infinitives (*there to be*) and *-ing* forms (*there being*) are also used.

- *I don’t want **there to be** any more trouble.*
- *What’s the chance of **there being** an election this year?*

## Other verbs: *there lived ...*

In a formal or literary style, some other verbs can be used with *there* besides *be*. These are mostly verbs which refer to states or arrivals.

- *In a small town in Germany **there** once **lived** a poor shoemaker.*
- ***There remains*** *nothing more to be done.*
- *Suddenly **there entered** a strange figure dressed all in black.*
- ***There followed*** *an uncomfortable silence.*

## Definite subjects

*There* is not normally used in a sentence with a definite subject (e.g. a noun with a definite article, or a proper name).

- *The door was open.* (not *~~There was the door open.~~*)
- *James was at the party.* (not *~~There was James at the party.~~*)

One exception to this is when we simply name people or things, in order to draw attention to a possible solution to a problem.

- ‘*Who could we ask?*’ ‘*Well, **there’s James**, or Miranda, or Anna, or Emma, ...*’
- ‘*Where can he sleep?*’ ‘*Well, **there’s** always **the attic**.*’

Another apparent exception is in oral stories that begin *There was this ...*, when *this* has an indefinite sense.

- ***There was this*** *man, see, and he couldn’t get up in the mornings. So he ...*
