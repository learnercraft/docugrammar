# Comparative and superlative adverbs

Most comparative and superlative adverbs are made with *more* and *most*.

- *Could you talk **more quietly**?* (not *~~… quietlier~~*)

Adverbs that have the same form as adjectives [(see here)](./../adverbs-and-adverbials/adverbs-or-adjectives-confusing-cases), and a few others, have comparatives and superlatives with *\-er* and *\-est*. The most common are: *fast*, *early*, *late*, *hard*, *long*, *near*, *high*, *low*, *soon*, *well* (*better*, *best*), *badly* (*worse*, *worst*), and in informal English *slow*, *loud* and *quick*.

- *Can’t you drive any **faster**?*
- *Can you come **earlier**?*
- *Talk **louder**.* (informal)
- *We’ve all got terrible voices, but I sing **worst** of all.*

Note also the irregular comparatives and superlatives of *far* (*farther*/*further*, *farthest*/*furthest*, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/farther-and-further), *much* (*more*, *most*, [(see here)](./../determiners-quantifiers/more) and [(see here)](./../determiners-quantifiers/most), *little* (*less*, *least*, [(see here)](./../determiners-quantifiers/less-and-fewer).
