# Using comparatives and superlatives

## *than*

After comparatives we use *than*, not *that* or *as*.

- *Today’s hotter **than** yesterday.* (not *~~… hotter that …~~* or *~~… hotter as …~~*)

## The difference between comparatives and superlatives

We use a comparative to compare one person, thing, action, event or group with another person, thing, etc. We use a superlative to compare somebody/something with the whole group that he/she/it belongs to.

Compare:

- *Emily’s **taller** than her three sisters.*  
  *Emily’s **the tallest** of the four girls.* (not *~~… the taller …~~*)
- *Your accent is **worse** than mine.*  
  *Your accent is **the worst** in the class.* (not *~~… the worse …~~*)
- *He plays **better** than everybody else in the team.*  
  *He’s **the best** in the team.*

## Groups with two members

When a group only has two members, we sometimes use a comparative instead of a superlative.

- *I like Lily and Mia, but I think Mia’s **the nicer**/**nicest** of the two.*
- *I’ll give you **the bigger**/**biggest** steak: I’m not very hungry.*

Some people feel that a superlative is incorrect in this case.

## Double comparatives: *fatter and fatter*; *more and more slowly*

We can use double comparatives to say that something is changing.

- *I’m getting **fatter and fatter**.*
- *We’re going **more and more slowly**.* (not *~~… more slowly and more slowly.~~*)

## *the … the …*

We can use comparatives with *the … the …* to say that things change or vary together.

Word order (in both clauses):

:::tip[Grammar]

*the* + comparative expression + subject + verb

:::

- ***The older** I get, **the happier** I am.* (not *~~Older I get, more I am happy.~~*)
- ***The more dangerous** it is, **the more** I like it.* (not *~~The more it is dangerous, …~~*)
- ***The more** I study, **the less** I learn.*

Noun phrases with *more* can be used in this structure.

- ***The more money** he makes, **the more useless things** he buys.*

In longer structures, *that* is sometimes used before the first verb.

- *The more information **that** comes in, the more confused the picture is.*

A short form of this structure is used in the expression *The more the merrier*, and in sentences ending *the better*.

- *‘How do you like your coffee?’ ‘**The stronger the better**.’*

Note that in this structure, the word *the* is not really the definite article – it was originally a form of the demonstrative pronoun, meaning ‘by that much’.

## *than me*; *than I* (am)

In an informal style, object pronouns (*me*, etc) are used after *than*. In a more formal style, subject pronouns (*I*, etc) are used (usually with verbs).

- *She’s older than **me**.* (informal)
- *She is older than **I (am)**.* (formal)

## *the happiest man in the world*

After superlatives, we do not usually use *of* with a singular word referring to a place or group.

- *I’m the **happiest** man **in** the world.* (not *~~… of the world.~~*)
- *She’s the **fastest** runner **in** the class.* (not *~~… of the class.~~*)

But *of* can be used before plurals, and before *lot*.

- *She’s the fastest runner **of them all**.*
- *He’s the best **of the lot**.*

Note also the structure with possessive ’*s*.

- *He thinks he’s **the world’s strongest** man.*

## *than anybody*; *the best … ever*

‘Non-affirmative’ words like *ever*, *yet* and *any* [(see here)](./../basic-clause-types/non-affirmative-words-anybody-ever-yet-etc) often follow comparatives and superlatives.

- *It’s the **best** book I’ve **ever** read.*
- *This is my **hardest** job **yet**.*
- *You’re **more stubborn** than **anybody** I know.*

:::note

For tenses after *than*, [(see here)](./../conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/tense-simplification-in-subordinate-clauses).

For *the first*/*second*/*best*, etc + present/past perfect, [(see here)](./../past-and-perfect-tenses/this-is-the-first-last-etc).
