# Emphatic coordination: both … and; (n)either … (n)or; not only

We may want to emphasise that both (or all) parts of a coordination have equal weight. There are several common ways of doing this.

## *both … and*

We often balance this structure, so that the same kind of words or expressions follow *both* and *and*.

- *She’s **both** pretty **and** clever.* (adjectives)
- *I spoke to **both** the Director **and** her secretary.* (nouns)
- *She **both** dances **and** sings.* (verbs)

However, unbalanced sentences with *both … and* are common. Some people prefer to avoid them.

- *She **both** dances **and** she sings.* (***both*** **\+ verb**; ***and*** **\+ clause**)
- *I **both** play the piano **and** the violin.*

*Both* cannot begin a complete clause in this structure.

- *He can **both** borrow the house **and*** (he can) use the car. (but not *~~Both he can borrow the house and he can use the car.~~*)

## *either … or*

We use *either … or* to talk about a choice between two or more possibilities.

- *I don’t speak **either** Russian **or** Polish.*
- *You can **either** come with me now **or** walk home.*
- *If you want ice cream there’s **either** raspberry, lemon **or** vanilla.*

We often balance this structure, so that the same kind of words or expressions follow *either* and *or*.

- *You can have **either** tea **or** coffee.* (nouns)
- *He’s **either** in London **or** in New York.* (prepositional phrases)
- ***Either** you’ll leave this house **or** I’ll call the police.* (clauses)

However, unbalanced sentences with *either … or* are common.

- *You can **either** have tea **or** coffee.*
- *He’s **either** in London **or** New York.*
- *You’ll **either** leave this house **or** I’ll call the police.*

There is a prescriptive ‘rule’, found in some books, which says that *either* should not introduce more than two alternatives (as in *either raspberry, lemon or vanilla*). This rule is mistaken: it does not correspond to normal usage.

:::note

For *either* as a determiner, [(see here)](./../determiners-quantifiers/either).

For pronunciation, [(see here)](./../determiners-quantifiers/either#pronunciation).

## *neither … nor*

This structure is the opposite of *both … and*. It is usually rather formal.

- *I **neither** smoke **nor** drink.* (less formal: *I don’t smoke or drink.*)
- *The film was **neither** well made **nor** well acted.*

Sometimes more than two ideas are connected by *neither … nor*.

- *He neither **smiled**, **spoke**, nor **looked** at me.*

*Neither* cannot begin a complete clause in this structure.

- *He neither smiled … nor …* (but not *~~Neither he smiled …~~*)

When singular subjects are connected by *neither … nor*, the verb is normally singular, but it can be plural in a less formal style.

- *Neither James nor Virginia **was** at home.* (normal)
- *Neither James nor Virginia **were** at home.* (less formal)

As with *either … or*, there is a prescriptive ‘rule’ , found in some books, which says that *neither* should not introduce more than two alternatives (as in *He neither smiled, spoke nor looked at me*). This rule is mistaken.

## *not only … but also*

In the rather formal structure *not only … but also*, the expressions *not only* and *but also* can go immediately before the words or expressions that they modify.

- *We go there **not only in winter**, **but also in summer**.*
- ***Not only the bathroom** was flooded, **but also the rest** of the house.*
- *The place was **not only cold**, **but also damp**.*

Mid-position with the verb [(see here)](./../adverbs-and-adverbials/mid-position-details) is also possible.

- *She **not only sings** like an angel, but also dances divinely.*
- *She **not only plays** the piano, but also the violin.*

*Not only* can be moved to the beginning of a clause for emphasis. It is then followed by auxiliary verb + subject; *do* is used if there is no other auxiliary (for more about this word order, [(see here)](./../information-structure/inversion-auxiliary-verb-before-subject). *But* can be left out in this case.

- ***Not only has she been** late three times; she has also done no work.*
- ***Not only do they need** clothing, but they are also short of water.*

In informal English *not only … but also* is not very common; other structures are generally preferred.

- *We **don’t only** go there in winter. We go in summer **too**.*
