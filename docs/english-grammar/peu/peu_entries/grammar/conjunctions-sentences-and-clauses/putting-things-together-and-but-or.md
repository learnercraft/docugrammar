# Putting things together: *and*, *but*, *or*

## *and*

*And* can join two or more grammatically similar expressions, from single words up to complete clauses.

- *bread **and** cheese*
- *the Prime Minister **and** his cabinet*
- *You need to go home **and** have a good rest.*
- *Her English is good **and** her Japanese is not bad.*

With more than two expressions, we generally only put *and* before the last.

- *We drank, talked **and** danced.*
- *He started as a cleaner, he worked his way up, **and** now he runs the company.*

*And* is sometimes left out in a very literary or poetic style, but this is unusual.

- *My dreams are full of darkness, despair, death.*

In expressions joined by *and*, repeated words are often left out.

- *We need a saw, (a) hammer **and** (a) screwdriver.*
- *She’s worked in China, (in) Thailand **and** (in) Brazil.*

## Fixed expressions: *bread and butter*, *hands and knees*

Some common expressions with *and* have a fixed order which cannot be changed. The shortest expression often comes first.

- *bread and butter* (not *~~butter and bread~~*)
- *hands and knees* (not *~~knees and hands~~*)
- *young and pretty*
- *black and white*
- *thunder and lightning*
- *cup and saucer*
- *knife and fork*

Note: *and* is usually pronounced /ənd/, not /ænd/ [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/pronunciation-weak-and-strong-forms).

## *but*

*But* can also join grammatically similar expressions.

- *They were poor **but** happy.*
- *There were some chairs **but** no tables.*

Most often, *but* joins clauses.

- *We wanted to stay **but** we simply didn’t have time.*
- *The film started well, **but** then it went downhill.*

## *or*

*Or* also joins grammatically similar expressions.

- *Would you like tea **or** coffee?*
- *We can meet today **or** wait till Thursday.*

After a negative verb, we use *or*, not *and*.

- *He does**n’t** smoke **or** drink.* (not *~~He doesn’t smoke and drink.~~*)

But *or* does not join negative adjectives or adverbs. Compare:

- *We were not comfortable **or** happy.*
- *We were uncomfortable **and** unhappy.* (not *~~… uncomfortable or unhappy.~~*)
