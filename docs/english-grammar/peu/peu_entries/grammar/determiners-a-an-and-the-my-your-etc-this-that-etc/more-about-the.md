# More about *the*

## *the* = ‘you know which one(s)’

*The* usually means something like ‘you know which I mean’. We use *the* before a noun (singular, plural or uncountable) when our listener/reader knows (or can easily see) which particular person(s), thing(s), etc we are talking about. Compare:

- *I’m going to **the bank**.* (The listener knows which: the usual one.)  
  *Is there **a bank** near here?* (any bank)
- *I didn’t like **the film**.* (the one that the speaker and listener saw)  
  *Let’s go and see **a film**.* (The speaker doesn’t say which one.)
- *She arrived on **the 8.15 train**.* (The speaker says which train.)  
  *She arrived in **an old taxi**.* (The speaker doesn’t say which old taxi.)
- *Did you wash **the clothes**?* (The listener knows which clothes.)  
  *I need to buy **clothes**.* (No one knows exactly which clothes will be bought.)
- *What did you do with **the coffee** I bought?* (The speaker says which coffee.)  
  *I don’t drink **coffee**.* (any coffee)

Our listener/reader may know which one(s) we mean because:

## We have mentioned it/them before

- *She’s got two children: a boy and a girl. **The boy**’s fourteen and **the girl**’s eight.*
- *‘So what did you do then?’ ‘Gave **the money** right back to **the policeman**.’* (The listener has already heard about the money and the policeman.)

## We say which one(s) we mean

- *Who are **the girls over there with Tom**?*
- *Tell Amy **the story about Jack and Susie**.*
- *He’s already lost **the phone he bought last week**.*

## It is clear from the situation which one(s) we mean

- *Could you close **the door**?* (Only one door is open.)
- *Anna’s in **the kitchen**.*
- *Did you enjoy **the party**?*
- *I can’t find **the car papers**.*
- *What’s **the time**?*

## *the* = ‘the only one(s) around’

The listener may know which one we mean because there is no choice – there is only one (e.g. *the sun*, *the moon*, *the earth*, *the world*, *the universe*, *the future*) or there is only one in our part of the world (e.g. *the government*).

- *I haven’t seen **the sun** for days.*
- *Do you trust **the government**?*
- *People used to think **the earth** was flat.*
- *Do you know **the Aldersons**?* (It is clear to the listener that there can only be one family of that name around.)
- *Go straight over two sets of traffic lights and then turn right after **the supermarket**.* (The listener doesn’t know the supermarket, but has enough information to identify it.)

## Superlatives: *I’m the oldest.*

We usually use *the* with superlatives [(see here)](./../comparison/comparison-advanced-points#superlatives-with-or-without-the) because there is normally only one best, biggest, etc individual or group (so it is clear which one(s) we are talking about). For the same reason, we usually use *the* with *first*, *next*, *last*, *same* and *only*.

- *I’m **the oldest** in my family.*
- *Can I have **the next** pancake?*
- *We went to **the same** school.*

## *the* meaning ‘the well-known’

After a name, an identifying expression with *the* is often used to make it clear that the person referred to is ‘the well-known one’.

- *She married Brad Pitt, **the actor**.*
- *I’d like you to meet Cathy Parker, **the novelist**.*

## Possessives and demonstratives

We do not use *the* with possessives or demonstratives.

- *This is **my** uncle.* (not *~~… the my uncle.~~*)
- *Is that **Emily’s** car?* (not *~~… the Emily’s car?~~*)
- *I like **this** beer.* (not *~~… the this beer.~~*)

## Proper nouns (names)

We do not usually use *the* with singular proper nouns (there are some exceptions, [(see here)](./special-rules-and-exceptions#place-names).

- ***Emily** lives in **Switzerland**.* (not *~~The Emily lives in the Switzerland.~~*)

But note the use of *the* (pronounced /ðiː/) with a person’s name to mean ‘the well-known’.

- *‘My name’s Emma Watson.’ ‘What, not **the Emma Watson**?’*

## Things in general

We usually use no article, not *the*, to talk about things in general – *the* does not mean ‘all’. (For details and exceptions, [(see here)](./talking-in-general).)

- ***Books** are expensive.* (not *~~The books are expensive.~~*)
- ***Life** is hard.* (not *~~The life is hard.~~*)

## Pronunciation

*The* is normally pronounced /ðiː/ before a vowel and /ðə/ before a consonant. Compare:

- *the ice* /ðiː aɪs/
- *the snow* /ðə snəʊ/

The choice between /ðiː/ and /ðə/ depends on pronunciation, not spelling. We pronounce /ðiː/ before a vowel sound, even if it is written as a consonant.

- *the hour* /ðiː ˈaʊə(r)/
- *the MP* /ðiː ˌem ˈpiː/

 And we pronounce /ðə/ before a consonant sound, even if it is written as a vowel.

- **the* **u**niversity* /ðə ˌjuːnɪˈvɜːsəti/
- **the* **o**ne-pound coin* /ðə ˌwʌn ˌpaʊnd ˈkɔɪn/

 We sometimes pronounce a stressed /ðiː/ before a hesitation, or when we want to stress the noun phrase, even if the noun begins with a consonant.

- *He’s the* /ðiː/ *– just a moment – deputy assistant vice-president.*
- *I’ve found the* /ðiː/ *present for Angela!*
