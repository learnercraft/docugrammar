# *this*/*that* and *it*: things that have just been mentioned

## Referring back

*This*, *that* and *it* can all be used to refer back to things or situations that have just been talked or written about. *It* does not give any special emphasis.

- *So she decided to paint her house pink. **It** upset the neighbours a bit.*

*This* and *that* are more emphatic; they ‘shine a light’, so to speak, on the things or situations, suggesting ‘an interesting new fact has been mentioned’.

- *So she decided to paint her house pink. **This**/**That** really upset the neighbours, as you can imagine.*

*This* is preferred when there is more to say about the new subject of discussion.

- *So she decided to paint her house pink. **This** upset the neighbours so much that they took her to court, believe it or not. The case came up last week …*
- *Then in 1917 he met Andrew Lewis. **This** was a turning point in his career: the two men entered into a partnership which lasted until 1946, and …* (More natural than *… That was a turning point …*)

## More than one thing

When more than one thing has been mentioned, *it* generally refers to the main subject of discussion; *this* and *that* generally refer to a new subject that has been introduced (often the last thing mentioned). Compare:

- *We keep the ice-cream machine in the spare room. **It** is mainly used by the children, incidentally.* (The machine is used by the children.)  
  *We keep the ice-cream machine in the spare room. **This**/**That** is mainly used by the children, incidentally.* (The spare room is used by the children.)
- *I was carrying the statue to my office when I dropped it on the kitchen table. **It** was badly damaged.* (The statue was damaged.)  
  *I was carrying the statue to my office when I dropped it on the kitchen table. **This** was badly damaged.* (The table was damaged.)

## Focus

*It* is only used to refer to things which are ‘in focus’ – which have already been talked about. *This* is preferred when we ‘bring things into focus’ before anything has been said about them. Compare:

- *I enjoyed ‘Vampires’ Picnic’. **It**/**This** is a film for all the family …*
- *``VAMPIRES’ PICNIC``: **This** is a film for all the family …* (not *~~``VAMPIRES’ PICNIC``: It is a film for all the family …~~*)

## Referring forward

Only *this* can refer forward to something that has not yet been mentioned.

- *Now what do you think about **this**? I thought I’d get a job in Spain for six months, and then …* (not *~~Now what do you think about that/it …~~*)
