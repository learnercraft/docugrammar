# *all*, *everybody/everyone* and *everything*

## *all* and *everybody*/*everyone*

We do not normally use *all* without a noun phrase to mean ‘everybody’. Compare:

- ***All the people** stood up.*
- ***Everybody**/**Everyone** stood up.* (not *~~*All* stood up.~~*)

## *all* and *everything*

*All* (without a noun phrase) can mean ‘everything’, but usually only in the structure *all* + relative clause (*all that …*). Compare:

- ***All* (that) I have** is yours. (not *~~*All what* I have …~~*)  
  ***Everything** is yours.* (not *~~*All* is yours.~~*)
- *She lost **all (that) she owned**.*  
  *She lost **everything**.* (not *~~She lost *all*.~~*)

This structure often has a rather negative meaning, expressing ideas like ‘nothing more’ or ‘the only thing(s)’.

- *This is **all I’ve got**.*
- ***All I want** is a place to sit down.*
- ***All that happened** was that he went to sleep.*

Note also *That’s all* (= It’s finished; There’s no more).

## Older English

In older English, *all* could be used alone to mean ‘everybody’ or ‘everything’ (e.g. *Tell me **all***; ***All** is lost*; ***All** are dead*). This only happens regularly in modern English in dramatic contexts like newspaper headlines (e.g. *``SPY TELLS ALL``*).
