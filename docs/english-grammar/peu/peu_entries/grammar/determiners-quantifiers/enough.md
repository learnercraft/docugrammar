# enough

## *enough* + noun

*Enough* can be used before a noun as a determiner.

- *Have you got **enough milk**?*
- *There aren’t **enough glasses**.*

*Enough* is occasionally used after a noun, but this is rare in modern English except in a few expressions.

- *If only we had **time enough** …*
- *I was **fool enough** to believe him.*

Before another determiner (article, possessive, etc) or a pronoun, we use *enough of*. Compare:

- *I don’t know **enough** Spanish to read this.* (not *~~… enough of Spanish …~~*)  
  *I don’t understand **enough of the** words in the notice.*
- *We haven’t got **enough** blue paint.* (not *~~… enough of blue paint.~~*)  
  *We haven’t got **enough of that** blue paint.*
- *You didn’t buy **enough** cards.* (not *~~… enough of cards~~*)  
  *You didn’t buy **enough of them**.*

Note the idiomatic structure *I’ve had enough of* … This can be followed by a noun without a determiner.

- ***I’ve had enough of** mathematics; I’m going to give it up.*
- ***She’s had enough of** England; she’s going back home.*

## Without a noun

*Enough* can be used alone without a noun to refer to an amount, if the meaning is clear.

- *Half a pound of carrots will be **enough**.*
- *That’s **enough**, thank you.*
- *Enough is **enough.***
- but not *~~The meat is enough.~~* (The meat is not an amount.)
