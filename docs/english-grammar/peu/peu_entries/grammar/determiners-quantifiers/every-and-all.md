# *every* and *all*

*Every* and *all* can both be used to talk about people or things in general, or about all the members of a group. There is little difference of meaning; *every* often suggests ‘without exception’. The two words are used in different structures.

## *every* with singular nouns; *all* with plurals

*Every* is used with a singular noun. To give the same meaning, *all* is used with a plural noun. Compare:

- ***Every child** needs love.* (not *~~**All child** needs love.~~*)  
  ***All children** need love.*
- ***Every light** was out.*  
  ***All (of) the lights** were out.*

## *every* not used with determiners

We can use *all* (of), but not normally *every*, with certain determiners (articles, possessives or demonstratives). Compare:

- ***All (of) the plates** were broken.*  
  ***Every plate** was broken.* (not *~~**Every the plate** / **The every plate …**~~*)
- *I’ve written to **all (of) my friends**.*  
  *I’ve written to **every friend I have**.* (not *~~… **every my friend** / **my every friend**.~~*)

## *all* with uncountables

We can use *all*, but not *every*, with uncountable nouns.

- *I like **all music**.* (not *~~… *every music*.~~*)

## *all day* and *every day*, etc

Note the difference between *all day/week*, etc and *every day/week*, etc.

- *She was here **all day**.* (= from morning to night)
- *She was here **every day**.* (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, …)
