# *least* and *fewest*

## *the least* as determiner: superlative of *little*

*The least* can be used as a determiner before uncountable nouns; it is the superlative of *little* (= not much, [(see here)](./a-little-and-a-few), and the opposite of *the most*.

- *I think I probably do **the least work** in this office.*

*The least* can be used without a noun if the meaning is clear.

- *Jess earns the most money in our family; Dan earns **the least**.*

We use *the least of* before plural abstract nouns to mean ‘the smallest of’.

- *‘What will your mother think?’ ‘That’s **the least of** my worries.’*

## ‘any … at all’

With singular abstract nouns, *the least* can mean ‘any … at all’.

- *Do you think there’s **the least chance** of Smith winning the election?*
- *‘What’s the time?’ ‘I haven’t got **the least** idea.’*

## *the fewest* as determiner: superlative of *few*

*The fewest* can be used before plural nouns as the superlative of *few* [(see here)](./a-little-and-a-few).

- *The translation with **the fewest mistakes** isn’t always the best.*

*Least* is often used instead of *fewest* before plural nouns (*… the **least** mistakes*), especially in an informal style. Some people feel this is incorrect.

## *(the) least* with adjectives: the opposite of *(the) most* or *(the) …est*

- ***The least expensive** trips are often the most interesting.*
