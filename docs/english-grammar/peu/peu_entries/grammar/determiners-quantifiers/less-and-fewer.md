# *less* and *fewer*

## The difference

*Less* is the comparative of *little* (used especially before uncountable nouns). *Fewer* is the comparative of *few* (used before plural nouns). Compare:

- *I earn **less money** than a cleaner.*
- *I’ve got **fewer problems** than I used to have.*

In an informal style, *less* is quite common before plural nouns. Some people consider this incorrect.

- *I’ve got **less problems** than I used to have.*

## *less*/*fewer* with and without *of*

Before another determiner (article, possessive, etc) or a pronoun, we use *less of* and *fewer of*. Compare:

- *If you want to lose weight, eat **less** food.* (not *~~… less of food.~~*)  
  ***Fewer** people make their own bread these days.* (not *~~Fewer of people …~~*)
- *I’d like to spend **less of my** time answering emails.*  
  *At the college reunions, there are **fewer of us** each year.*

## *less* and *fewer* without nouns

Nouns can be dropped after *less* and *fewer* if the meaning is clear.

- *Some people go to church, but **less**/**fewer** than 20 years ago.*

*Less* can be used as an adverb (the opposite of the adverb *more*).

- *I worry **less** than I used to.*
