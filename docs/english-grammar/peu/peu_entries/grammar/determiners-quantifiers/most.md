# most

## *most (of)*

We can use *most* as a determiner before uncountable or plural nouns. Note that we do not use *the* before *most* in this case.

- ***Most children** like ice cream.* (not *~~The most children …~~*)

Before another determiner (article, possessive, etc) or a pronoun, we use *most of*. Compare:

- ***Most** fruit is imported.*  
  ***Most of our** fruit is imported.*  
  ***Most of it** is imported.*
- ***Most** people can sing a little.*  
  ***Most of these people** can sing a little.*  
  ***Most of them** can sing a little.*

However, *most of* can be used directly before personal and geographical names.

- *I’ve read **most of Shakespeare**.*
- *The Romans conquered **most of England**.*

## *most* without a noun

We can drop a noun after *most* if the meaning is clear.

- *Some people had difficulty with the lecture, but **most** understood.*

## *the most* (= ‘more than any other/others’) with nouns

In comparisons (when *most* means ‘more than any other/others’) it is normally used with *the* before nouns.

- *Susan found **the most blackberries**.*

*The* is sometimes dropped in an informal style.

- *Who earns **(the) most money** in your family?*

## *the most* as an adverb

*(The) most* can also be used as an adverb.*The* is often dropped in an informal style.

- *They all talk a lot, but your little girl talks **(the) most**.*
- *The truth hurts **most**.*

:::note

For *most* in superlatives (e.g. *the most beautiful*), [*Comparison*](../comparison/comparison-introduction).
