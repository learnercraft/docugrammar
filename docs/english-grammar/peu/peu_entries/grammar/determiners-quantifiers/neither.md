# *neither*

## *neither* + singular noun

We use *neither* before a singular noun to mean ‘not one and not the other (of two)’.

- *‘Can you come on Monday or Tuesday?’ ‘I’m afraid **neither day** is possible.’*

## *neither of* + plural

We use *neither of* before a determiner (for example *the*, *my*, *these*), and before a pronoun. The noun or pronoun is plural.

- ***Neither of my** brothers can sing.* (not *~~Neither my brothers can sing.~~*)
- ***Neither of** **us** saw it happen.*

After *neither of* + noun/pronoun, we use a singular verb in a formal style.

- *Neither of my sisters **is** married.*

In an informal style, a plural verb is possible.

- *Neither of my sisters **are** married.*

## *neither* used alone

We can use *neither* without a noun or pronoun, if the meaning is clear.

- *‘Which one do you want?’ ‘**Neither**.’*

## Pronunciation

In British English, *neither* can be pronounced both /ˈnaɪðə(r)/ and /ˈniːðə(r)/. In American English, the usual pronunciation is /ˈniːðər/.
