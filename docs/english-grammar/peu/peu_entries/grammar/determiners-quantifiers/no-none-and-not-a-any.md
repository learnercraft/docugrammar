# *no*, *none* and *not a/any*

## *no*: emphatic

*No* can be used instead of *not a* or *not any* when we want to emphasise a negative idea.

- *Would you believe it? There’s **no** mirror in the bathroom!* (More emphatic than … *There isn’t a mirror* …)
- *Sorry I can’t stop. I’ve got **no** time.* (More emphatic than … *I haven’t got any time*.)
- *There were **no** messages for you this morning, I’m afraid.* (More emphatic than *There weren’t any messages* …)

## *none of*

Before a determiner (e.g. *the*, *my*, *this*) or a pronoun, we use *none of*.

- *She’s done **none of the** work.* (not *~~… no of the work.~~*)
- *We understood **none of his** arguments.*
- *I’ve been to **none of those** places.*
- ***None of us** speaks Greek.*

When we use *none of* with a plural noun or pronoun, the verb can be singular (a little more formal) or plural (a little more informal).

- *None of my friends **is** interested.* (more formal)
- *None of my friends **are** interested.* (more informal)

We can use *none* alone if the meaning is clear.

- *‘How many of the books have you read?’ ‘**None**.’*

## *not a*/*any*

We prefer *not a*/*any* in objects and complements when the sense is not emphatic. Compare:

- *He’s **no** fool.* (= He’s not a fool at all. – emphatic negative)
- *A whale is **not a** fish.* (not *~~A whale is no fish~~* – the sense is not emphatic.)

## Subjects

*Not any* cannot normally be used in subjects. *No* and *none* *of* are used instead.

- ***No** brand of cigarette is completely harmless.* (not *~~Not any brand …~~*)
- ***No** tourists ever came to our village.* (not *~~Not any tourists …~~*)
- ***None of** my friends lives near me.* (not *~~Not any of my friends …~~*)

## Not used to talk about two

We use *neither*, not *no* or *none*, to talk about two people or things [(see here)](./neither).

- ***Neither** of my parents could be there.* (not *~~None of my parents …~~*)

## *nobody*, etc

*Nobody*, *nothing*, *no one* and *nowhere* are used in similar ways to *no*.

- *I saw **nobody**.* (More emphatic than *I didn’t see anybody*.)
- ***Nobody** spoke.* (not *~~Not anybody spoke.~~*)
