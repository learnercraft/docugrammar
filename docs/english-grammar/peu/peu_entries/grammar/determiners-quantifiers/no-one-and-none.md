# *no one* and *none*

## *no one*

*No one* (also written *no-one* in British English) means the same as *nobody*. It cannot be followed by *of*.

- ***No one** wished me a happy birthday.* (not *~~No one of my friends …~~*)
- *I stayed in all evening waiting, but **no one** came.*

## *none*

To express the idea ‘not a single one (of)’, we can use *none (of)*, *not any (of)* or *not one (of)* (more emphatic). *No one* is not used in this way.

- ***None of** my friends wished me a happy birthday.*
- *I have**n’t** read **any of** his books.*
- ***Not one of** my shirts is clean.* (not *~~No one of my shirts …~~*)
- *‘Have you found any blackberries?’ ‘**Not one**.’*
