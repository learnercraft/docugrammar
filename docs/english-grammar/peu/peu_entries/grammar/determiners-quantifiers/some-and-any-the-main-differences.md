# *some* and *any*: the main differences

## Indefinite quantities

Both *some* [(see here)](./some) and *any* [(see here)](./any) can refer to an indefinite quantity or number. They are used when it is not easy, or not important, to say exactly how much/many we are thinking of.

- *I need **some** new clothes.*
- *Is there **any** milk left?*

Used in this sense, *some* is most common in affirmative clauses; *any* is a ‘non-affirmative’ word [(see here)](./../basic-clause-types/non-affirmative-words-anybody-ever-yet-etc) and is common in questions and negatives. Compare:

- *I need **some** flour.*
- *Do you have **any** flour?*
- *Sorry, I don’t have **any** flour.* (not *~~Sorry, I don’t have some flour.~~*)

## *some* in questions

We use *some* in questions if we expect people to answer ‘Yes’, or want to encourage them to say ‘Yes’ – for example in offers and requests.

- *Have you brought **some** paper and a pen?* (The hearer is expected to bring them.)
- *Shouldn’t there be **some** instructions with it?*
- *Would you like **some** more meat?*
- *Could I have **some** brown rice, please?*
- *Have you got **some** glasses that I could borrow?*

## *any* in affirmative clauses

We use *any* in affirmative clauses after words that have a negative or limiting meaning: for example *never*, *hardly*, *without*, *little*.

- *You **never** give me **any** help.*
- *There’s **hardly any** tea left.*
- *I **forgot** to get **any** bread.*
- *We got there **without any** trouble.*
- *There is **little** point in doing **any** more work now.*
- *The guards **prevented** us from asking **any** questions.*

## *if*-clauses

Both *some* and *any* are common in *if*\-clauses.

- *If you want **some**/**any** help, let me know.*

Sometimes *any* is used to suggest ‘if there is/are any’.

- ***Any** cars parked in this road will be towed away.* (= If there are any cars parked in this road, they will …)

:::note

For the ‘free choice’ use of *any* (e.g. ***Any** child could do this*), [(see here)](./any-it-doesn-t-matter-who-which-what).
