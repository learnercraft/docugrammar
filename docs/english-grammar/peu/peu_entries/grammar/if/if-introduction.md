# Introduction

## Uncertain events and situations

In clauses after *if*, we usually talk about uncertain events and situations: things which may or may not happen, which may or may not be true, etc.

- *Ask Jack **if he’s staying tonight**.* (He may or may not be staying.)
- ***If I see Annie**, I’ll give her your love.* (I may or may not see Annie.)

## Conditions

An *if*\-clause often refers to a condition – something which must happen so that something else can happen.

- ***If you get here before eight**, we can catch the early train.*
- *Oil floats **if you pour it on water**.*

Clauses of this kind are often called ‘conditional’ clauses.

## ‘first’, ‘second’ and ‘third’ conditionals; other structures

Some students’ grammars concentrate on three common sentence structures with *if*, which are often called the ‘first’, ‘second’ and ‘third’ conditionals.

| ‘first conditional’ | |
| --- | --- |
| ********if*** + present***** | ********will*** + infinitive***** |
| *If we play tennis,* | *I’ll win.* |

| ‘second conditional’ | |
| --- | --- |
| ********if*** + past***** | ********would*** + infinitive***** |
| *If we played tennis,* | *I would win.* |

| ‘third conditional’ | |
| --- | --- |
| ********if*** + past perfect***** | ********would have*** + past participle***** |
| *If we had played tennis,* | *I would have won.* |

These are useful structures to practise. However, students sometimes think that these are the only possibilities, and become confused when they meet sentences like *If she didn’t phone this morning, then she’s probably away* (‘What’s this? A fourth conditional?’). It is important to realise that *if* is not only used in special structures with *will* and *would*; it can also be used, like other conjunctions, in ordinary structures with normal verb forms. (A research study carried out in the 1990s found that less than 25% of *if*\-conditional sentences follow the traditional ‘first’, ‘second’ and ‘third’ patterns.)

## Position of *if*-clause

An *if*\-clause can come at the beginning or end of a sentence. When an *if*\-clause comes first, it is often followed by a comma.

Compare:

- ***If you eat too much**, you get fat.*
- *You get fat **if you eat too much**.*

## How good are the rules?

The ‘rules’ given in this Section are intended to be useful for learners. They describe what happens most of the time, and are generally valid for formal speech and writing. However, usage is far from fixed, and educated speakers and writers quite often mix structures. So if a sentence is crossed out in one of the following explanations (e.g. *~~If I would know her name, I would tell you~~*) this means that it should be avoided in contexts like formal letters or examination scripts. It may not strictly speaking be wrong.
