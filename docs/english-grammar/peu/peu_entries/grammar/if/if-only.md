# *if only*

We can use *If only …!* to say that we would like things to be different. It means the same as *I wish …* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/wish), but is more emphatic. The clause with *if only* often stands alone, without a main clause. Tense use is as follows:

## Past to talk about the present

- ***If only** I **knew** more people!*
- ***If only** I **was** better-looking!*

We can use *were* instead of *was* [(see here)](./special-structures-with-past-tenses-and-would#if-i-were-etc).

- *If only your father **were** here!*

## *would* + infinitive (without *to*) to talk about the future

- ***If only** it **would** **stop** raining, we could go out.*
- ***If only** somebody **would smile**!*

## Past perfect to talk about the past

- ***If only** she **hadn’t told** the police, everything would have been all right.*
