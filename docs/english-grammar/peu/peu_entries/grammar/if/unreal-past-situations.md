# Unreal past situations

:::tip[Example]

- *If you had worked harder, you would have passed your exam.*

:::

## *if* + past perfect; *would have* + past participle

To talk about past situations that did not happen, we use a past perfect tense in the *if*\-clause, and *would have* + past participle in the other part of the sentence.

- ***If** you **had asked** me, I **would have told** you.* (not *~~If you would have asked me …~~*) or *~~If you asked me …~~* or *~~… I had told you.~~*
- ***If** you **had worked** harder, you **would have passed** your exam.*
- *I’**d have been** in bad trouble if Megan **hadn’t helped** me.*

## *could have …* and *might have* …

We can use *could have* + past participle to mean ‘would have been able to …’, and *might have* + past participle to mean ‘would perhaps have … ’ or ‘would possibly have …’.

- *If he’d run a bit faster, he **could have won**.*
- *If I hadn’t been so tired, I **might have realised** what was happening.*

## Present use: situations that are no longer possible

We sometimes use structures with *would have …* to talk about present and future situations which are no longer possible because of the way things have turned out.

- *It **would have been** nice to go to Australia this winter, but there’s no way we can do it.* (or *It would be nice …*)
- *If my mother hadn’t met my father at a party thirty years ago, I **wouldn’t have been** here now.* (or *… I wouldn’t be here now.*)
