# -ing forms after prepositions: *without breaking eggs*

## After all prepositions

When we put a verb after a preposition, we normally use an *\-ing* form (gerund), not an infinitive.

- *You can’t make an omelette **without breaking** eggs.* (not *~~… without to break eggs.~~*)
- *Always check the oil **before starting** the car.* (not *~~… before to start the car.~~*)
- *We got the job finished **by working** sixteen hours a day.*
- *He’s talking **about moving** to the country.*
- *I like to cycle to work **instead of driving**.* (not *~~… instead to drive …~~*)

## *to* as a preposition: *I look forward to …ing*

*To* is actually two different words. It can be an infinitive marker, used to show that the next word is an infinitive (e.g. ***to** swim*, ***to** laugh*). It can also be a preposition, followed for example by a noun (e.g. *She’s gone **to** the park*, *I look forward **to** Christmas*).

When *to* is a preposition, it can be followed by the *\-ing* form of a verb, but not normally by the infinitive. Common expressions in which this happens are *look forward to*, *object to*, *be used to*, *prefer* (doing one thing **to doing** another), *get round to*, *in addition to*.

In the following examples, note how the preposition *to* can be followed by either a noun or an *\-ing* form.

- *I look forward **to your next email**.*  
  *I look forward **to hearing** from you.* (not *~~… to hear from you.~~*)
- *Do you object **to Sunday work**?*  
  *Do you object **to working** on Sundays?*
- *I’m not used **to London traffic**.*  
  *I’m not used **to driving** in London.*
- *I prefer the seaside **to the mountains**.*  
  *I prefer swimming **to walking**.*
- *I’ll get round **to the bills** sooner or later.*  
  *I’ll get round **to paying** the bills sooner or later.*

A few verbs and adjectives are used with *to* before nouns, but are followed by the infinitives of verbs. Examples are *agree*, *consent*, *entitled*, *inclined*, *prone*.

- *She agreed **to our plan**. / She agreed **to do** what we wanted.*
- *He’s inclined **to anger**. / He’s inclined **to lose** his temper.*

*Accustomed* can be followed by *to* + *\-ing* form or an infinitive [(see here)](./infinitives-or-ing-forms-both-possible-with-different-uses#attempt-intend-continue-cant-bear-be-accustomed-to-be-committed-to).

## Object + infinitive after *for*: *for her to arrive*

Note that some verbs are followed by *for* + object + infinitive. An *\-ing* form is not usually possible in these cases.

- *We’re still waiting **for her to arrive**.* (not *~~… waiting for her arriving.~~*)
- *Can you arrange **for us to get** tickets?* (not *~~… for our getting tickets?~~*)
