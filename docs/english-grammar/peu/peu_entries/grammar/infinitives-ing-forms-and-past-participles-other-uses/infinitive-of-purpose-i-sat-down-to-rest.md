# Infinitive of purpose: *I sat down to rest.*

## *I sat down to rest.*

We often use an infinitive to talk about a person’s purpose – why he or she does something.

- *I sat down **to rest**.* (not *~~I sat down for resting / for to rest.~~*)
- *He went abroad **to forget**.*
- *I’m going to Austria **to learn German**.*
- ***To switch on**, press red button.*

## *in order to*; *so as to*

We can also use *in order to …* (more formal) or *so as to …*

- *He got up early **in order to have time to pack**.*
- *I watched him **in order to know more about him**.*
- *I moved to a new flat **so as to be near my work**.*

*In order to* / *so as to* are normal before negative infinitives.

- *I’m going to leave now, **so as not to be** late. More natural than *I’m going to leave now, not to be late.**

A *for*\-structure [(see here)](./for-to) can be used to talk about a purpose that involves action by somebody else.

- *I left the door unlocked **for Harriet to get in**.*
