# Infinitives: introduction

Infinitives have many functions. An infinitive can be used, for example, after *do* or a modal auxiliary verb as part of a verb phrase.

- ***Do** you **think** she’s ready?*
- *We **must get** some more light bulbs.*

An infinitive can also be used, alone or with other words:

- as the subject or complement of a clause [(see here)](./infinitive-as-subject-or-complement)

  - ***To watch** him eating really gets on my nerves.*
  - *The main thing is **to relax**.*
  - *It’s nice **to talk** to you.*
- as the object or complement of a verb, adjective or noun ( [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/infinitives-after-adjectives-pleased-to-see-you), [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/infinitives-after-verbs-it-s-beginning-to-rain)
