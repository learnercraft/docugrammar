# Infinitives without to: *I saw you come in.*

We usually use *to* with infinitives (e.g. *I want **to know***). But we use the infinitive without *to* (sometimes called the ‘bare infinitive’) in some cases.

## After modal auxiliary verbs

After the modal auxiliary verbs *will*, *shall*, *would*, *should*, *can*, *could*, *may*, *might* and *must*, we use the infinitive without *to*.

- *I **must go** now.* (not *~~I must to go now.~~*)
- *Do you think she **might be** joking?*
- ***Can** you **help** me?*
- *I **would** rather **go** alone.*

We also use the infinitive without *to* after *had better* [(see here)](./../modal-auxiliary-verbs/weaker-obligation-had-better), and sometimes after *dare* and *need* ( [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/dare), [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/need).

- *You’**d better see** what she wants.*
- *I **daren’t go** out at night.* (BrE)
- *She **needn’t do** the washing up.*

## After *let*, *make*, *hear*, etc

Certain verbs expressing perception and causation are followed by object + infinitive without *to*. They include *let*, *make*, *see*, *hear*, *feel*, *watch* and *notice*.

- *She **lets** her children **stay** up very late.* (not *~~She lets her children to stay…~~*) or *~~She lets her children staying …~~*
- *I **made** them **give** me the money back.*
- *We both **heard** him **say** that he was leaving.*
- *I didn’t **see** you **come** in.*
- *Did you **feel** the earth **move**?*

*Help* can also be used in this way [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/help).

- *Could you **help** me **(to) unload** the car?*

This structure is also possible with *have* [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/causative-and-similar-structures-with-have) and *know* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/know).

- ***Have** Mrs Hansen **come** in, please.* (especially AmE)
- *I’ve never **known** him **(to) pay** for a drink.*

In passive versions of these structures the infinitive with *to* is used.

- *He **was made to pay** back the money.*
- *She **was heard to say** that she disagreed.*

## After *why* (not)

We can introduce questions and suggestions with *why* (not) + infinitive without *to*. For more details, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/why-and-why-not).

- ***Why pay** more at other shops? We have the lowest prices.*
- ***Why stand up** if you can sit down? **Why sit down** if you can lie down?*
- *You’re looking tired. **Why not take** a break?*

## After *and*, *or*, *except*, *but*, *than*, *as* and *like*

When two infinitive structures are joined by *and*, *or*, *except*, *but*, *than*, *as* or *like*, the second is often without *to*.

- *I’d like to lie down **and sleep**.*
- *Do you want to have lunch now **or wait** till later?*
- *We had nothing to do **except look** at the sea.*
- *I’m ready to do anything **but work** on a farm.*
- *It’s easier to do it yourself **than explain** to somebody else how to do it.*
- *It’s as easy to smile **as frown**.*
- *I have to feed the animals as well **as look** after the children.*
- *Why don’t you do something useful **like clean** the kitchen?*

*Rather than* is usually followed by an infinitive without *to*.

- ***Rather than wait** any more, I decided to go home by taxi.*

## After *do*

Expressions like *All I did was*, *What I do is*, etc can be followed by an infinitive without *to*.

- *All I did was **(to) give** him a little push.*
- *What a fire-door does is **(to) delay** the spread of a fire.*
- *The only thing we can do is **(to) accept**.*
