# -ing form as subject, object or complement

## *Smoking is bad for you.*

An *\-ing* form (gerund) can be used, just like a noun, as the subject or complement of a verb.

- ***Smoking** is bad for you.* (subject)
- *My favourite activity is **reading**.* (complement)

Infinitives (e.g. *To smoke is bad for you*) are possible in these cases, but are formal and uncommon.

*\-ing* forms can also be used as objects after certain verbs [(see here)](../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/ing-forms-after-verbs-i-enjoy-travelling).

- *I hate **packing**.* (object)

## *-ing* form with its own object

The *\-ing* form subject, complement or object is used like a noun, but it is still a verb and can have its own object.

- ***Smoking cigarettes** is bad for you.*
- *My favourite activity is **reading thrillers**.*
- *I hate **packing suitcases**.*

## *the opening of Parliament*; *my smoking*

We can often use determiners (for example *the*, *my*, *this*) with *\-ing* forms.

- ***the** opening of Parliament*
- *Does **my** smoking annoy you?*
- *I hate all **this** useless arguing.*

Possessive ’*s* forms are also possible.

- ***Jack’s** going to sleep during the wedding was rather embarrassing.*
- *She was angry at **Lina’s** trying to lie to her.*

Subject pronouns are not possible.

- *His shouting gets on my nerves.* (but not *~~He shouting …~~*)

Note that possessives and pronouns are not used before *\-ing* forms if it is already clear who is being talked about.

- *Thank you for **waiting**.* (not *~~Thank you for your waiting.~~*)

When an *\-ing* form is used with an article, it cannot usually have a direct object. Instead, we can use an *of*\-structure.

- ***the** smoking **of** cigarettes* (not *~~the smoking cigarettes~~*)

*No* is often used with an *\-ing* form to say that something is not allowed, or is impossible. This often happens in notices and after *there is*.

- *``NO SMOKING``*
- *``NO PARKING``*
- *``NO WAITING``*
- *Sorry – there’s **no smoking** in the waiting room.*
- *She’s made up her mind; there’s **no arguing** with her.*

## Object forms: *Do you mind me smoking?*

In an informal style it is more common to use object forms (like *me*, *Jack*) instead of possessives (*my*, *Jack’s*) with *\-ing* forms, especially when these come after a verb or preposition.

- *Do you mind **me smoking**?*
- *She was angry at **Lina lying** to her.*

After some verbs (e.g. *see*, *hear*, *watch*, *feel*) possessives are not normally used with *\-ing* forms, in formal or informal language.

- *I **saw him getting** out of the car.* (not *~~I saw his getting …~~*)

## *It’s nice being with you.*

We can use *it* as a preparatory subject or object for an *\-ing* form ( [(see here)](./../information-structure/preparatory-it-subject).

- ***It**’s nice **being** with you.*
- *I thought **it** pointless **starting** before eight o’clock.*

This is common with *any*/*no good*, *any*/*no use* and *(not) worth* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/worth).

- ***It**’s **no good** talking to him – he never listens.*
- *Is **it any use** expecting them to be on time?*
- ***It**’s **no use his**/**him** apologising – I will never forgive him.*
- *I didn’t think **it worth** complaining about the meal.*

## Nouns and *-ing* forms

When there is a noun which has a similar meaning to an *\-ing* form, the noun is usually preferred.

- *We’re all excited about his **arrival**.* (not *~~… about his arriving.~~*)
