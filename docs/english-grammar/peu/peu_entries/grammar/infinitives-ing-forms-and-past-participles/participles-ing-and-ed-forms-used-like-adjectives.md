# Participles: -ing and -ed forms used like adjectives

## Names

When *\-ing* forms are used in similar ways to adjectives, they are called ‘**present participles**’. Forms like *broken*, *sung*, *opened*, *started* are called ‘**past participles**’. But note that both forms can be used for the past, present or future.

- *We were nearly hit by **falling** rocks.*
- *We haven’t got a single **working** computer in the office.*
- *The house is going to be full of **screaming** children.*
- *I was taken to hospital with a **broken** arm.*
- *These cakes are beautifully **cooked**.*
- *Daniel will be **surprised** to see you.*

(The same terms are used when these forms are used as parts of verb tenses, see [Verbs](../verbs/verbs-introduction).)

## Active and passive

When *\-ing* forms are used like adjectives, they have similar meanings to active verbs.

- ***falling** leaves* (= leaves that fall)
- *a meat-**eating** animal* (= an animal that eats meat)

Most past participles have passive meanings when they are used like adjectives.

- *a **broken** heart* (= a heart that has been broken)
- *The house looked **abandoned**.* (= … as if it had been abandoned.)

## Participles and adjectives: interested and interesting, etc

Some adjectives look like present or past participles (and the difference between adjectives and participles is not always clear). They are discussed here for convenience. These adjectives, too, may have an active/passive contrast. For example, *interesting*, *boring*, *exciting* and *confusing* have active meanings: they describe things that *interest* people, *bore* them and so on. *Interested*, *bored*, etc have passive meanings: they show how people *are made* to feel. Compare:

- *The lesson was really **interesting**.*  
  *I was very **interested** in the lesson.* (not *~~I was very interesting in the lesson.~~*)
- *It was a terribly **boring** party.*  
  *I didn’t enjoy the party because I was **bored**.* (not *~~… because I was boring.~~*)
- *Granny takes the kids to **exciting** places.*  
  *The kids get **excited** when Granny comes.* (not *~~… The kids get exciting …~~*)
- *He’s a very **confusing** writer.*  
  *She explained everything, but I was still very **confused**.* (not *~~… very confusing.~~*)

## Active past participles: *a fallen leaf*; *advanced students*

Some past participles can be used as adjectives with active meanings before nouns.

- *a **fallen** leaf* (= a leaf that has fallen)
- ***advanced** students*
- ***developed** countries*
- ***increased** activity*
- ***vanished** civilisations*
- *a **retired** general*
- *a **collapsed** building*
- *a **grown-up** daughter*
- *an **escaped** prisoner*
- ***faded** colours*
- ***swollen** ankles*

Most of these can be used after *be*.

- *She **is retired** now.*
- *My family **are** all **grown up**.*
- *Those curtains **are** badly **faded**.*
- *This class **is** the most **advanced**.*
- *My wrist **is swollen**.*

Some others are used after *be*, but not before nouns.

- *Why **are** all those cars **stopped** at the crossroads?* (but not *~~… a stopped car~~*)
- *I hope you’**re** fully **recovered** from your operation.*
- *We’**re camped** in the field across the stream.*
- *I’**ll be finished** in a few minutes.*
- *Those days **are gone** now.*

*Sat* and *stood* are often used like this in informal speech in British English.

- *When I saw her she was **sat** on the ground crying.*
- *Why is that man **stood** in the doorway?*

A few past participles are used with active meanings in expressions with adverbials but not otherwise.

- *a **well-read** person* (but not *~~a read person~~*)
- *a **much-travelled** man*
- ***recently-arrived** immigrants*
- *The train **just arrived** at platform six is the delayed 13.15 from Hereford.*

## Compound structures: *English-speaking Canadians*

Participles used as adjectives can have objects. Note the word order.

- ***English-speaking** Canadians.* (not *~~speaking-English Canadians.~~*)
- *a **fox-hunting** man*
- *Is that watch **self-winding**?*

Other compound structures with participles are also common before nouns.

- ***quick-growing** trees*
- ***home-made** cake*
- *a **recently-built** house*
- ***government-inspired** rumours*
- *the **above-mentioned** point*

## After nouns: *the people questioned*

We often use participles after nouns in order to define or identify the nouns, in the same way as we use identifying relative clauses [(see here)](./../relative-clauses/identifying-and-non-identifying-clauses-the-tall-man-who-mr-rogers-who).

- *We couldn’t agree on any of the **problems discussed**.* (= … the problems that were discussed.) (not *~~… the discussed problems.~~*)
- *The **people questioned** gave very different opinions.* (= The people who were questioned …) (not *~~The questioned people …~~*)
- *I watched the match because I knew some of the **people playing**.* (not *~~… the playing people.~~*)
- *I got the only **ticket left**.* (not *~~… the only left ticket.~~*)

*Those* is often used with a participle to mean ‘the ones who are/were’.

- *Most of **those questioned** refused to answer.*
- ***Those selected** will begin training on Monday.*

## Differences of meaning

A few participles change their meaning according to their position. Compare:

- *a **concerned** expression* (= a worried expression)  
  *the people **concerned*** (= the people who are/were affected)
- *an **involved** explanation* (= a complicated explanation)  
  *the people **involved*** (= the same as *the people concerned*)
- *an **adopted** child* (= a child who is brought up by people who are not his/her biological parents)  
  *the solution **adopted*** (= the solution that is/was chosen)

## *much admired*; *very frightened*

When a past participle is part of a passive verb, we can put *much* or *very much* before it, but not *very*.

- *He’s **(very) much admired** by his students.* (not *~~… very admired …~~*)
- *Britain’s trade position has been **(very) much weakened** by inflation.* (not *~~… very weakened …~~*)

When a past participle is used as an adjective, we usually prefer *very*. This is common with words referring to mental states, feelings and reactions.

- *a **very frightened** animal* (not *~~a much frightened animal~~*)
- *a **very shocked** expression*
- *The children were **very bored**.*
- *She looked **very surprised**.*

Common exceptions:

- *That’s Alice, unless I’m **(very) much mistaken**.* (not *~~… unless I’m very mistaken.~~*)
- *He’s **well known** in the art world.* (not *~~… very known …~~*)

With *amused*, *very* and *(very) much* are both possible.

- *I was **very amused** / **much amused** / **very much amused** by Miranda’s performance.*

## *frightened by* / *frightened of*

*By* is used after passive verbs to introduce the agent (the person or thing that does the action, [(see here)](./../passives/by-agent).

- *Most of the damage was caused **by your sister**.*

After past participles that are used like adjectives, we prefer other prepositions. Compare:

- *She was **frightened by** a mouse that ran into the room.* (*Frightened* is part of a passive verb referring to an action.)  
  *She’s always been terribly **frightened of** dying.* (*Frightened* is an adjective referring to a state of mind.)
- *The kids were so **excited by** the music that they kept screaming.*  
  *Joe’s **excited about** the possibility of going to the States.*
- *I was **annoyed by** the way she spoke to me.*  
  *I’m **annoyed with** you.*
- *The burglar was **surprised by** the family coming home unexpectedly.*  
  *I’m **surprised at**/**by** your attitude.*
- *He was badly **shocked by** his fall.*  
  *We were **shocked at**/**by** the prices in London.*

Other examples:

- *His whereabouts are **known to** the police.*
- *The hills are **covered in** snow.*
- *The room was **filled with** thick smoke.*

## Special past participle forms: *drunken laughter*

A few older forms of past participles are still used as adjectives before nouns in certain expressions.

- ***drunken** laughter/singing, etc*
- *a **shrunken** head*
- *a **sunken** wreck/ship, etc*
- ***rotten** fruit/vegetables, etc*
