# Ellipsis: infinitives

## *to* used instead of whole infinitive: *We hope to.*

We can use *to* instead of the whole infinitive of a repeated verb (and following words), if the meaning is clear.

- *‘Are you and Gillian getting married?’ ‘We hope **to**.’*
- *‘Let’s go for a walk.’ ‘I don’t want **to**.’*
- *I don’t dance much now, but I used **to** a lot.*
- *Sorry I shouted at you. I didn’t mean **to**.*
- *‘Somebody ought to clean up the bathroom.’ ‘I’ll ask Jack **to**.’*

*Be* and *have* (used for possession) are not usually dropped.

- *There are more flowers than there used **to be**.* (not *~~… than there used to.~~*)
- *She hasn’t been promoted yet, but she ought **to be**.* (not *~~… but she ought to.~~*)
- *You’ve got more freckles than you used **to have**.* (not *~~You’ve got more freckles than you used to.~~*)

## Ellipsis of whole infinitive: *I’ll try.*

In some cases the whole infinitive can be left out. This happens after nouns and adjectives.

- *He’ll never leave home; he hasn’t got the **courage** (to).*
- *You can’t force him to leave home if he’s not **ready** (to).*

It also happens after verbs which can stand alone without a following infinitive.

- *‘Can you start the car?’ ‘I’ll **try** (to).’*

## *(would) like*, *want*, etc

We cannot usually leave out *to* after *would like*/*love*/*hate*/*prefer*, *want* and *choose*.

- *‘Are you interested in working abroad?’ ‘I’d **like to**. ’* (not *~~… I’d like.~~*)
- *My parents encouraged me to study art, but I didn’t **want to**.* (not *~~… I didn’t want.~~*)

However, *to* is often dropped after *want*, and almost always after *like*, when these are used after certain conjunctions – for instance *when*, *if*, *what*, *as*.

- *Come **when** you **want** (to).*
- *I’ll do **what** I **like**.*
- *Stay as long **as** you **like**.*
