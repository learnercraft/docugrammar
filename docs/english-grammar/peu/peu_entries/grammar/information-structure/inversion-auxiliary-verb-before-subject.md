# Inversion: auxiliary verb before subject

We put an auxiliary verb (and non-auxiliary *have* and *be*) directly before the subject of a clause in several different structures.

## Questions

- ***Have your father and mother** arrived?* (not *~~Have arrived your father and mother?~~*)
- *Where **is the concert** taking place?* (not *~~Where is taking place the concert?~~*) or *~~Where the concert is taking place?~~*

Spoken questions do not always have this word order [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/declarative-questions-that-s-the-boss).

- ***You’re** coming tomorrow?*

Indirect questions do not usually have this order [(see here)](./../noun-clauses-direct-and-indirect-speech/indirect-speech-questions-and-answers).

- *I wondered what time **the film was starting**.* (not *~~… what time was the film starting.~~*)

However, in formal writing inversion is sometimes used with *be* in indirect questions after *how*, especially when the subject is long.

- *I wondered how reliable **was the information** I had been given.*

## Exclamations

Exclamations [(see here)](./../basic-clause-types/exclamations) often have the form of negative questions [(see here)](./../basic-clause-types/negative-questions).

- ***Isn’t it** cold?*
- ***Hasn’t she** got lovely eyes?*

In spoken American English, exclamations often have the same form as ordinary (non-negative) questions (but with different intonation).

- **Have you* got a surprise coming!*
- **Was I* mad!*

In a rather old-fashioned literary style, inversion is sometimes found in exclamations after *how* and *what*.

- *How beautiful **are the flowers**!*
- *What a peaceful place **is Skegness**!*

## With *may*

*May* can come before the subject in wishes.

- ***May all your wishes** come true!*
- ***May he** rot in hell!*

## After *so*, *neither*, *nor*

In ‘short answers’ and similar structures, these words are followed by auxiliary verb + subject.

- *‘I’m hungry.’ ‘So **am I**.’*
- *‘I don’t like opera.’ ‘Neither/Nor **do I**.’*

## After *as*, *than* and *so*

Inversion sometimes happens after *as*, *than* and *so* in a literary style.

- *She was very religious, **as were most of her friends**.*
- *City dwellers have a higher death rate **than do country people**.*
- ***So** ridiculous **did she look** that everybody burst out laughing.*

## Conditional clauses: *Were she my daughter …*

In formal and literary conditional clauses, an auxiliary verb can be put before the subject instead of using *if* [(see here)](./../if/other-points#leaving-out-if-formal-inversion-structures--had-i-realised-).

- ***Were she** my daughter …* (= If she were my daughter …)
- ***Had I** realised what you intended …* (= If I had realised …)

Negatives are not contracted in this case.

- ***Had we not** spent all our money already, …* (not *~~Hadn’t we spent …~~*)

## After negative and restrictive expressions: *At no time was he …*

If a negative adverb or adverbial expression is put at the beginning of a clause for emphasis, it is usually followed by auxiliary verb + subject. These structures are mostly rather formal.

- ***Under no circumstances can we** accept late payment.*
- ***At no time was the President** aware of what was happening.*
- ***Not until much later did she** learn who her real father was.*

The same structure is possible after a complete clause beginning *not until …*

- ***Not until he received her letter did he** fully understand her feelings.*

Inversion is also used after restrictive words like *hardly* (in BrE), *seldom*, *rarely*, *little* and *never*, and after *only* + time expression. This is formal or literary.

- ***Hardly had I** arrived when trouble started.* (BrE)
- ***Seldom have I** seen such a remarkable creature.*
- ***Little did he** realise the danger he faced.*
- ***Never … was so much** owed by so many to so few.* (Churchill)
- ***Only then did I** understand what she meant.*
- ***Only after her death was I** able to appreciate her.*
- ***Not only did we** lose our money, but we were nearly killed.*
- ***Not a single word did he** say.*

Inversion is not used after *not far …* and *not long …*

- ***Not far** from here **you can** see foxes.* (not *~~Not far from here can you …~~*)
- ***Not long** after that **she got** married.*
