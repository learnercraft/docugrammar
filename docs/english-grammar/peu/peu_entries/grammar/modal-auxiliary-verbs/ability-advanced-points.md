# Ability: advanced points

## Future: *can* or *will be able*

We use *can* to talk about future actions which we will be able to do because of present ability, present circumstances, present decisions, etc.

- *She **can** win the race tomorrow if she really tries.*
- *I’ve bought the tent, so we **can** go camping next weekend if we want to.*
- *I haven’t got time today, but I **can** see you tomorrow.*
- ***Can** you come to a party on Saturday?*

In other cases we prefer other structures, for example *will be able to*.

- ***I’ll be able** to speak French at the end of this course.* (not *~~I can speak French …~~*)
- *One day people **will be able** to go to the moon for the weekend.* (or it will be possible to go …)

## *could* in the past

*Could* is not normally used to say that somebody did something on one occasion in the past [(see here)](./ability-can-and-could#past-could-is-not-always-possible).

- *I **managed to** buy a really nice coat yesterday.* (not *~~I could buy a really nice coat yesterday.~~*)

However, *could* can refer to one occasion with certain verbs: *see*, *hear*, *taste*, *feel*, *smell*, *understand*, *remember* and *guess* [(see here)](./can-and-could-with-see-hear-etc).

- *I **could smell** something burning.*
- *I **could understand** everything she said.*

And we can use *could* to talk about one occasion with words like *hardly* or *only*, that have a negative sense.

- *She **could hardly** believe her eyes.*
- *I **could only** get six eggs.*

*Could* can also sometimes refer to one occasion in subordinate clauses.

- *I’m so glad that you **could** come.*

## Languages and instruments: *She speaks Greek.*

We often leave out *can* when we are talking about the ability to speak languages or to play instruments.

- *She **speaks** Greek. / She **can speak** Greek.*
- ***Do/Can** you **play** the piano?*

## *can/could always*

*Can/could always* can mean ‘can/could … if there is nothing better’.

- *‘I don’t know what to get Mark for his birthday.’ ‘Well, you **can always** give him a gift card.’*
- *‘What are we going to eat?’ ‘We **could always** warm up that soup.’*
