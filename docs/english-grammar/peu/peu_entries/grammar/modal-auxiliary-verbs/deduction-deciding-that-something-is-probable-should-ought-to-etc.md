# Deduction (deciding that something is probable): *should*, *ought to*, etc

## Present or future

*Should* can be used to express the deduction or conclusion that something is probable now or in the future: it is expected, normal or logical.

- *I’ve bought three loaves – that **should** be enough.*
- *I’ll phone Ruth – she **should** be home by now.*
- *‘We’re spending the winter in Miami.’ ‘That **should** be nice.’*

*Ought to* [(see here)](./weaker-obligation-should-and-ought-to#ought-forms) is used in a similar way, but is much less common.

- *Henry **ought** to be here soon – he left home at six.*
- *The weather **ought** to improve after the weekend.*

## Past: *should have* / *ought to have* …

We do not normally use *should* \+ infinitive to talk about the past.

However, we can use *should have* / *ought to have* + past participle to make guesses or draw conclusions about things which are not certain to have happened.

- *James **should have got** back home yesterday. Has anybody seen him?* (not *~~James should get back home yesterday …~~*)

We can also use this structure to talk about actions which we expect to have been completed by now or at a future time.

- *Ten o’clock. She **should have arrived** at her office by now. I’ll try calling her.*
- *We **ought to have finished** painting the house by the end of next week.*

## *be supposed to*

We can use *be supposed to* to say that something is or was normal or expected.

- *Cats **are supposed to** be afraid of dogs, but ours isn’t.*
- *Bill **was supposed to** get back home yesterday.*

Note the pronunciation: /səˈpəʊst tə/, not /səˈpəʊzd tə/.
