# *have (got) to* and *must*

## Where does the obligation come from?

In statements about obligation with *must* the obligation most often comes from the speaker (and in questions, from the hearer). To talk about an obligation that comes from ‘outside’ (for instance a regulation, or an order from somebody else), we usually prefer *have to*. Compare:

- *I **must** do some more work; I want to pass my exam.*  
  *In my job I **have to** work from nine to five.* (More natural than … *I must work from nine to five*.)
- *We **must** go to New York soon – we haven’t seen your mother since Christmas.*  
  *My wife’s an interpreter: she often **has to** go to New York.* (More natural than … *she must often go to New York*.)
- *I **must** stop smoking.* (I want to.)  
  *I’**ve got to** stop smoking.* (Doctor’s orders.)
- *This is a terrible party. We really **must** go home.*  
  *This is a lovely party, but we’**ve got to** go home because of the children.*
- *I’ve got bad toothache. I **must** make an appointment with the dentist.*  
  *I can’t come to work tomorrow morning because I’**ve got to** see the dentist.*
- *You really **must** go to church next Sunday – you haven’t been for ages.* (I am telling you to.)  
  *Catholics **have to** go to church on Sundays.* (Their religion tells them to.)
- ***Must** you wear dirty old jeans all the time?* (Is it personally important for you?)  
  *Do you **have to** wear a tie at work?* (Is there a regulation?)

*Have to* can also be used to talk about obligation coming from the speaker or hearer, in the same way as *must*. This is normal in American English (which uses *must* less often in this sense), and is becoming very common in British English.

- *I really **have to** stop smoking.* (or I really must …)
- *Do I **have to** clean all the rooms?* (or Must I …?)

## Future obligation: *will have to*, *have (got) to* and *must*

*Will have to* is used to talk about future obligation (*~~will must~~* is impossible, [(see here)](./modals-grammar-pronunciation-and-contractions#grammar); but *have (got) to* is preferred when arrangements for the future have already been made. Compare:

- *When you leave school you’**ll have to** find a job.*
- *I’**ve got to** go for a job interview tomorrow.*

*Going to have to* is also possible.

- *We’**re going to have to** repair that window.*

*Must* can be used to give orders or instructions for the future.

- *You can borrow my car, but you **must** bring it back before ten.*

*Will have to* can be used to ‘distance’ the instructions [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/politeness-distancing-verb-forms), making them sound less like direct orders from the speaker.

- *You can borrow my car, but you’**ll have to** bring it back before ten.*

*Will need to* can be used in the same way [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/need#talking-about-the-future).
