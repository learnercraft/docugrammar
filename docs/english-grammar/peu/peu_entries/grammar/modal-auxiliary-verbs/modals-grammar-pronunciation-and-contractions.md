# Modals: grammar, pronunciation and contractions

Modal verbs differ from ordinary verbs in several ways.

## Grammar

Modal verbs have no *\-s* in the third person singular.

- *She **may** know his address.* (not *~~She mays …~~*)

Questions, negatives, tags and short answers are made without *do*.

- *‘**Can you** swim?’ (not *~~Do you can swim~~*) ‘Yes, **I can**.’*
- *He **shouldn’t** be doing that, should he?* (not *~~He doesn’t should …~~*)

After modal auxiliary verbs, we use the infinitive without *to* of other verbs. *Ought* is an exception, [(see here)](./deduction-deciding-that-something-is-probable-should-ought-to-etc#present-or-future).

- *I must **water** the flowers.* (not *~~I must to water …~~*)

Progressive, perfect and passive infinitives are also possible [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles/infinitives-forms).

- *I may not **be working** tomorrow.*
- *She was so angry she could **have killed** him.*
- *The kitchen ought **to be painted** one of these days.*

Modal verbs do not have infinitives or participles (*~~to may, maying, mayed~~* do not exist), and they do not normally have past forms. Other expressions are used when necessary.

- *I’d like **to be able** to skate.* (not *~~… to can skate.~~*)
- *People really **had to** work hard in those days.* (not *~~People really musted work …~~*)

*Could*, *might*, *would* and *should* usually have present and future reference, but they can sometimes be used as past tenses of *can*, *may*, *will* and *shall*.

Certain past ideas can be expressed by a modal verb followed by a perfect infinitive (*have* + past participle).

- *You **should have told** me you were coming.*
- *I think I **may have annoyed** Aunt Mary.*

For details of these uses, see the entries on particular modal verbs.

*There* is quite often used as a preparatory subject with modal verbs, especially when these are followed by *be* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/there).

- ***There** may be rain later today.*

## Pronunciation and contractions

Several modals have weak pronunciations, used when they are not stressed: *shall* /ʃəl/, *should* /ʃəd/, *can* /kən/, *could* /kəd/, *must* /məst/. For more about weak pronunciations, [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/pronunciation-weak-and-strong-forms). *Ought to* is generally pronounced /ˈɔːtə/ (‘oughta’) in conversational speech; *should have*, *could have* and *might have* are often pronounced /ˈʃʊdə/, /ˈkʊdə/ and /ˈmaɪtə/. *Can’t* is pronounced /kɑːnt/ in standard British English and /kænt/ in standard American English.

Contracted negatives are *won’t*, *wouldn’t*, *shan’t* (BrE), *shouldn’t*, *can’t*, *couldn’t*, *oughtn’t*, *mightn’t* (BrE) and *mustn’t* (mostly BrE). *Will* and *would* also have contracted affirmative forms (*’ll*, *’d*).
