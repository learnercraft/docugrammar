# Permission: *can*, *could*, *may*, *might*, *be allowed to*

## Asking for, giving and refusing permission: *Can I …?*

We use *can* to ask for and give permission.

- *‘**Can** I ask you something?’ ‘Yes, of course you **can**.’*
- *You **can** go now if you want to.*

*Cannot*/*can’t* are used to refuse permission (often with other words to soften the refusal).

- *‘Can I have some more cake?’ ‘No, I’m afraid you **can’t**.’*

We also use *could* to ask for permission; it is more polite or formal than *can*. We do not use *could* to give or refuse permission (it suggests respect, so is more natural in asking for permission than in giving it).

- *‘**Could** I ask you something?’ ‘Yes, of course you can.’* (not *~~… of course you could.~~*)

*May* and *might* are also used to ask for permission, and *may* to give permission. They are more formal than *can*/*could*, and are less common. *Might* is very polite and formal, and is mostly used in indirect question structures.

- ***May** I switch on the TV?*
- *I wonder if I **might** have a little more cheese?*

*May not* (but not *might not*) can be used to refuse permission.

- *‘May I smoke?’ ‘I’m sorry, you **may not**.’*

There is an old belief that *may*/*might* are more ‘correct’ than *can*/*could* in these uses, but this does not reflect actual usage.

*Must not* [(see here)](./strong-obligation-must-will#negatives-you-mustntcant-) can also be used to refuse permission; it is more emphatic than *can’t* /*may not*.

## Talking about permission: *Can everybody …?*

*Can* is used to talk about permission that has already been given or refused, and about things that are allowed by rules or laws. *May* is not normally used in this way.

- ***Can** everybody park here?* (not *~~May everybody park here?~~*)

## Past permission: *could* is not always possible

In talking about the past, we use *could* (but not *might*) to say that somebody had permission to do something at any time (‘general permission’), but we do not use *could* to talk about permission for one particular action in the past. Compare:

- *When I was a child, I **could** watch TV whenever I wanted to.*
- *Yesterday evening, Daniel **was allowed** to watch TV for an hour.* (not *~~… Daniel could watch TV for an hour.~~*)

But *could not* can be used to talk about one particular action.

- *Daniel **couldn’t** watch TV yesterday because he was naughty.*

(The difference between *could* and *was*/*were allowed to* is similar to the difference between *could* and *was*/*were able to*. [(see here)](./ability-can-and-could#past-could-is-not-always-possible).)

## Indirect speech

*Can*, *could*, *may* and *might* can however all be used to report the giving of permission (general or particular). *Can*/*may* are used after present reporting verbs, and *could*/*might* after past verbs.

- *She says we **can** park here.*
- *They told us we **couldn’t** go in yet.*
- *The manager says we **may** leave our coats in the waiting room.*
- *Mr Newson agreed that I **might** look round.* (very formal)

## *be allowed to*

Modal verbs have no infinitives or participles. When necessary, permission is expressed in other ways: for example with forms of *be allowed to*.

- *She’s always **been allowed** to do what she liked.* (not *~~She’s always could …~~*)
