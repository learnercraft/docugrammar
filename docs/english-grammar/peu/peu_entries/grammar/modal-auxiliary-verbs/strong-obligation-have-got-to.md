# Strong obligation: *have (got) to*

## Meaning: obligation, certainty

We can use *have (got) +* infinitive to talk about obligation: things that it is necessary to do. The meaning is quite similar to *must*; for differences, [(see here)](./have-got-to-and-must#where-does-the-obligation-come-from).

- *Sorry, I’**ve got to** go now.*
- ***Do** you often **have to** travel on business?*

## Grammar: with or without *do*; *got*

In this structure, *have* can be used like an ordinary verb (with *do* in questions and negatives), or like an auxiliary verb (without *do*). *Got* is usually added to present-tense auxiliary-verb forms in an informal style.

- *When **do you have** to be back?*
- *When **have you (got)** to be back?*

*Have got to* is not normally used to talk about repeated obligation.

- *I usually **have to** be at work at eight.* (not *~~I’ve usually got to …~~*)

Progressive forms are possible to talk about temporary continued obligation.

- *I’**m having to** work very hard at the moment.*

For more details of the use of *do*\-forms and *got*\-forms of *have*, [(see here)](./../be-have-and-do/have-got-possession-relationships-and-other-states).

## Pronunciation of *have to*; *gotta*

*Have to* is often pronounced /ˈhæftə/.

- *He’**ll have to** /ˈhæftə/ get a new passport soon.*

Note the spelling **gotta**, sometimes used in informal American English (for instance in cartoon strips) to show the conversational pronunciation of *got to*.

- *I **gotta** call home.*
- *A man’s **gotta** do what a man’s **gotta** do.*
