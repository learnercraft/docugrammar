# Typical behaviour: *can*, *could*, *may*, *might*, *will*, *would*

## *can*, *could*, *may* and *might*

- *The flowers **may** have five or six petals, red or white in colour.*

## *will* and *would*

These verbs can also describe typical behaviour, often in the sense of what is habitual or regular.

- *She’**ll** sit talking to herself for hours.*
- *When you look at clouds they **will** often remind you of animals.*
- *If something breaks down and you kick it, it **will** often start working again.*

- *On Sundays when I was a child we **would** all get up early and go fishing.*
- *Every summer he **would** go away for a month, without saying where or why.*

## Criticisms: *She* will *fall in love with the wrong people.*

Stressed *will* and *would* can be used to criticise people’s behaviour.

- *She will fall in love with the wrong people.*
- *Well, if you will keep telling people what you think of them …*
- *He was a nice boy, but he would talk about himself all the time.*

*Would* can be used to criticise a single past action, with the suggestion ‘That’s typical of you/him, etc’.

- *You would tell Emily about the party – I didn’t want to invite her.*
