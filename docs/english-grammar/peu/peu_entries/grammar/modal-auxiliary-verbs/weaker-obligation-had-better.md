# Weaker obligation: *had better*

## Meaning

We use *had better* to give strong advice, or to tell people what to do (including ourselves).

- *You’**d better** turn that music down before your dad gets angry.*
- *It’s seven o’clock. I’**d better** put the meat in the oven.*

*Had better* refers to the immediate future. It is more urgent than *should* or *ought*. Compare:

- *‘I really **ought** to go and see Fred one of these days.’ ‘Well, you’**d better** do it soon – he’s leaving for South Africa at the end of the month.’*

*Had better* is not used in polite requests. Compare:

- ***Could you** help me, if you’ve got time?* (request)
- ***You’d better** help me. If you don’t, there’ll be trouble.* (order/threat)

## Forms

*Had better* refers to the immediate future, but the form is always past (*~~have better~~* is impossible). After *had better* we use the infinitive without *to*.

- *It’s late – you **had** better **hurry** up.* (not *~~… you have better …~~*) or *~~… you had better hurrying / to hurry …~~*

We normally make the negative with *had better not* + infinitive.

- *You’**d better not wake** me up when you come in.* (*You hadn’t better wake me …* is possible in British English but very unusual.)

A negative interrogative form *Hadn’t … better …?* is possible.

- ***Hadn’t** we **better** tell him the truth?*

Normal unemphatic short answer forms are as follows:

- *‘Shall I put my clothes away?’ ‘**You’d better**!’*
- *‘He says he won’t tell anybody.’ ‘**He’d better not**.’*

*Had* (*’d*) is sometimes dropped in very informal speech.

- ***You better** go now.*
- ***I better** try again later.*
