# Willingness: *will*, *can*

## Announcing decisions: *I’ll answer it.*

We often use *will* when we tell people about a decision as we make it, for instance if we are agreeing to do something.

- *OK. I’**ll** buy the tickets. You can buy supper after the show.*
- *‘The phone’s ringing.’ ‘I’**ll** answer it’ .* (not *~~I’m going to answer it.~~*)
- *‘Remember to phone Joe, won’t you?’ ‘Yes, I **will**.’*

Note that the simple present is not normally used to announce decisions.

- *I think I’**ll** go to bed.* (not *~~I think I go to bed.~~*)
- *‘There’s the doorbell.’ ‘I’**ll** go.’* (not *~~… I go.~~*)

To announce decisions that have already been made, we generally prefer *going to* … or the present progressive ( [(see here)](./../talking-about-the-future/going-to).

- *Well, we’ve agreed on a price, and I’**m going to** buy it.*
- *I’ve made my decision and I’**m sticking** to it.*

Stressed *will* can express determination.

- *I **will** stop smoking! I really **will**!*

## Refusals: *I won’t do it!*

*Will not* or *won’t* is used to refuse, or to talk about refusals.

- *I don’t care what you say – I **won’t** do it!*
- *The car **won’t** start.*

## Promises and threats: *I’ll phone you tonight.*

We often use *will/’ll* in promises and threats. Note that the simple present is not possible in these cases.

- *I promise I **won’t** smoke again.* (not *~~I promise I don’t smoke …~~*)
- *I’**ll** phone you tonight.* (not *~~I phone …~~*)
- *I’**ll** hit you if you do that again.*
- *You’**ll** suffer for this!*

**Shall** is also possible in British English after *I* and *we*, but it is much less common than *will*.

- *I **shall** give you a teddy bear for your birthday.*

In older English, *shall* was often used with second- and third-person subjects in promises and threats. This is now very unusual.

- *You **shall** have all you wish for.*
- *He **shall** regret this.*

## Offers: *Can I carry your bag?*

We often use *can* when we offer to do things for people.

- *‘**Can** I carry your bag?’* (= Would you like me to …) *‘Oh, thank you.’*
- *‘I **can** babysit for you this evening if you like.’ ‘No, it’s all right, thanks.’*

*Could* is possible if we want an offer to sound less definite.

- *I **could** fix your bicycle for you, if that would help.*
