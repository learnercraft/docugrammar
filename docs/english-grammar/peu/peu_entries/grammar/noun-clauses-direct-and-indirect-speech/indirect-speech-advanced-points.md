# Indirect speech: advanced points

## Reporting past tenses

In indirect speech, a speaker’s past tenses are often reported using past perfect tenses.

- ``DIRECT:`` *I’**ve** just **written** to Jack.*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *She told me she **had** just **written** to Jack.*
- ``DIRECT:`` *I **saw** Penny at the theatre a couple of days ago.*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *In her email, she said she’**d seen** Penny at the theatre a couple of days before.*

However, past perfect tenses are not always used, especially if the time relationships are clear without a change from past to past perfect.

- *This man on TV said that dinosaurs **were** around for 250 million years.* (not *~~… that dinosaurs had been around …~~*)
- *I told you Jack **(had) phoned** this morning, didn’t I?*
- *We were glad to hear you **(had) enjoyed** your trip to Denmark.*

## Reporting present and future tenses

If somebody talked about a situation that has still not changed – that is to say, if the original speaker’s present and future are still present and future – a reporter can often choose whether to keep the original speaker’s tenses or to change them, after a past reporting verb. Both structures are common.

- ``DIRECT:`` *The earth **goes** round the sun.*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *He proved that the earth **goes**/**went** round the sun.*
- ``DIRECT:`` *How old **are** you?*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *Are you deaf? I asked how old you **are**/**were**.*
- ``DIRECT:`` *It **will** be windy tomorrow.*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *The forecast said it **will**/**would** be windy tomorrow.*

We are more likely to change the original speaker’s tenses if we do not agree with what he/she said, if we are not certain of its truth, or if we wish to make it clear that the information comes from the original speaker, not from ourselves.

- *The Greeks thought that the sun **went** round the earth.* (not *~~… that the sun goes round the earth.~~*)
- *She just said she **was** thirty! I don’t believe her for a moment.*
- *He announced that profits **were** higher than forecast.*

## Modal verbs in indirect speech

The modals *would*, *should*, *could*, *might*, *ought* and *must* are usually unchanged after past reporting verbs in indirect speech. This is also true of *needn’t* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/need) and *had better* [(see here)](./../modal-auxiliary-verbs/weaker-obligation-had-better).

- ``DIRECT:`` *It **would** be nice if I **could** see you again.*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *He said it **would** be nice if he **could** see me again.*
- ``DIRECT:`` *It **might** be too late.*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *I was afraid that it **might** be too late.*
- ``DIRECT:`` *It **must** be pretty late. I really **must** go.*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *She said it **must** be pretty late and she really **must** go.*
- ``DIRECT:`` *You **needn’t** pretend to be sorry.*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *I said he **needn’t** pretend …*

First-person *shall* and *should* may be reported as *would* in indirect speech (because of the change of person).

- ``DIRECT:`` *We **shall**/**should** be delighted to come.*
- ``INDIRECT:`` *They said they **would** be delighted to come.*

:::note

For *had to* as a past of *must*, [(see here)](./../modal-auxiliary-verbs/strong-obligation-must-will#past-necessity-and-obligation-they-had-to-work-very-hard).

## Reporting *‘Shall I …?’*

There are different ways of reporting questions beginning *Shall I …?*, depending on whether the speaker is asking for information or making an offer.

- ``DIRECT:`` ***Shall I** be needed tomorrow?* (BrE, information)  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *He wants to know if he **will** be needed tomorrow.*
- ``DIRECT:`` ***Shall I** carry your bag?* (offer)  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *He wants to know if he **should**/**can**/**could** carry your bag.*

## Conditionals

After past reporting verbs, sentences with *if* and *would* are usually unchanged.

- ``DIRECT:`` *It **would** be best if we **started** early.*
- ``INDIRECT:`` *He said it **would** be best if they **started** early.*

However, *if*\-sentences that refer to ‘unreal’ situations can change as follows.

- ``DIRECT:`` *If I **had** any money I’**d buy** you a drink.*
- ``INDIRECT:`` *She said if she **had had** any money, she **would have bought** me a drink.* (or *She said if she **had** any money, she **would buy** …*)

## Negative questions

Negative questions often express emotions such as surprise or enthusiasm [(see here)](./../basic-clause-types/negative-questions), and these are usually reported in special ways.

- ``DIRECT:`` *Don’t the children like ice cream?*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` ***She was surprised** that the children didn’t like ice cream.* (not *~~She asked if the children didn’t like ice cream.~~*)
- ``DIRECT:`` *Isn’t she lovely!*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` ***I remarked** how lovely she was.* (not *~~I asked if she wasn’t lovely.~~*)

## Word order with *what*, *who* and *which*

Questions beginning *who*/*what*/*which* + *be* can ask for a subject or a complement. Compare:

- ***Who is** the best player here?* (This asks for a subject: a possible answer is ***Jack** is the best player here.*)
- ***What is** the time?* (This asks for a complement: a possible answer is *The time is **4.30***, not *~~4.30 is the time.~~*)

When we report the first kind of question (where *who*/*what*/*which* + *be* asks for a subject), two word orders are possible.

- ``DIRECT:`` *Who’s the best player here?*  
  ``INDIRECT:``
  - *She asked me **who was the best player**.*  
  - *She asked me **who the best player was**.*
- ``DIRECT:`` *What’s the matter?*  
  ``INDIRECT:``
  - *I asked **what was the matter**.*  
  - *I asked **what the matter was**.*
- ``DIRECT:`` *Which is my seat?*  
  ``INDIRECT:``
  - *She wondered **which was her seat**.*  
  - *She wondered **which her seat was**.*

This does not normally happen when *who*/*what*/*which* asks for a complement, except in very informal speech.

- ``DIRECT:`` *What’s the time?*
- ``INDIRECT:`` *She asked **what the time was**.* (informally also *She asked what was the time.*)

## *She’s written I don’t know how many books.*

Complicated structures can be produced in informal speech when reporting expressions are put into sentences with question-word clauses or relatives.

- *She’s written **I don’t know how many books**.*
- *He’s gone **I don’t know where**.*
- *This is the man who **Anna said would tell us about the church**.*

## Indirect speech without reporting verbs

In newspaper, radio and TV reports, reports of parliamentary debates, records of conferences, minutes of meetings, etc, the indirect speech construction is often used with very few reporting verbs. The use of tenses is enough to make it clear that a text is a report.

- *The Managing Director began his address to the shareholders by summarising the results for the year. Profits on the whole **had been** high, though one or two areas **had been** disappointing. It **was**, however, important to maintain a high level of investment, and he **was** sure that the shareholders **would appreciate** …*

In literary narrative, similar structures are common. The reported speech may be made more vivid by using direct question structures and ‘here and now’ words.

- *At breakfast, Daniel refused to go to school. Why should he spend all his time sitting listening to idiots? What use was all that stuff anyway? If he stayed at home he could read books. He might even learn something useful. His father, as usual, was unsympathetic. Daniel had to go to school, by damn, and he had better get moving now, or there’d be trouble.*
