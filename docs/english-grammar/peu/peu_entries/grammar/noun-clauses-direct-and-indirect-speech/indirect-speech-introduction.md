# Indirect speech: introduction

## Change of situation

Words that are spoken or thought in one place by one person may be reported in another place at a different time, and perhaps by another person. Because of this, there are often grammatical differences between direct and indirect speech. Compare:

- *``JAMES`` (on Saturday evening): **I don’t like this** party. **I want** to go home **now**.*
- *``JACKIE`` (on Saturday evening): James says/said **he doesn’t like the** party, and **he wants** to go home.*
- *``DANIEL`` (on Sunday morning): James said that **he didn’t like the** party, and **he wanted** to go home.*

These differences are mostly natural and logical, and it is not necessary to learn complicated rules about indirect speech in English.

## Pronouns

A change of speaker may mean a change of pronoun.

In the above example, James says *I* to refer to himself. Jackie and Daniel, talking about what James said, naturally use *he*.

- *James said that **he** didn’t like …* (not *~~James said that I didn’t like …~~*)

## ‘here and now’ words

A change of place and time may mean changing or dropping words like *here*, *this*, *now*, *today*. Daniel, reporting what James said, does not use *this* and *now* because he is no longer at the party.

- *James said that he didn’t like **the** party …* (not *~~James said that he didn’t like this party …~~*)
- *… he wanted to go home.* (not *~~… to go home now.~~*)

Some other ‘here and now’ words: *next*, *last*, *yesterday*, *tomorrow*. Compare:

- ``DIRECT:`` *I’ll be back **next week**.*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *She said she’d be back **the next week**, but I never saw her again.*
- ``DIRECT:`` *Anna got her licence **last Tuesday**.*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *He said Anna had got her licence **the Tuesday before**.*
- ``DIRECT:`` *I had an accident **yesterday**.*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *He said he’d had an accident **the day before**.*
- ``DIRECT:`` *We’ll be there **tomorrow**.*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *They promised to be there **the next day**.*

## Tenses

A change of time may mean a change of tense.

- *James said that he **didn’t** like the party …* (not *~~James said that he doesn’t like the party …~~* – when Daniel is talking, the party is finished.)

## Dropping *that*

The conjunction *that* is often dropped, especially after common reporting verbs (e.g. *say*, *think*) in informal speech. For more details, [(see here)](./leaving-out-that).

- *She **said (that)** she’d had enough.*
- *I **think (that)** you’re probably right.*
