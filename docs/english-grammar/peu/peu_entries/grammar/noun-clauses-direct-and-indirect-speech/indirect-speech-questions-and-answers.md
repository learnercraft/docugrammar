# Indirect speech: questions and answers

## Word order: *I asked where Alice was.*

In reported questions the subject normally comes before the verb in standard English, and auxiliary *do* is not used.

- ``DIRECT:`` *Where’s Alice?*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *I asked **where Alice was**.* (not usually *… where was Alice.*)
- ``DIRECT:`` *When are you leaving?*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *He wanted to know **when I was leaving**.* (not usually *… when was I leaving.*)
- ``DIRECT:`` *What do I need?*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *She asked **what she needed**.* (not *~~… what did she need.~~*)
- ``DIRECT:`` *Where are the President and his wife staying?*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *I asked **where the President and his wife were staying**.* (not *~~Where were staying …~~*)

The same structure is used for reporting the answers to questions.

- *I knew **how they felt**.* (not *~~… how did they feel.~~*)
- *Nobody told me **why I had to sign** the paper.* (not *~~… why did I have to sign …~~*)
- *She explained **what the problem was**.*
- *They haven’t told me **where I’m going to work**.*

In very informal speech, indirect questions sometimes have the same word order as direct questions:

- *He asked when **was I** leaving.*
- *We’re wondering **will we** get to Cardiff on time, **will we** be able to park.*

## No question marks

Question marks are not used in reported questions.

- *We asked **where the money was**.* (not *~~… where the money was?~~*)

## *yes/no* questions: *He asked if* …

*Yes/No* questions are reported with *if* or *whether* (for the difference, [(see here)](./whether-and-if).

- *The driver asked **if/whether** I wanted the town centre.*
- *I don’t know **if/whether** I can help you.*

In reported questions, we do not use a present tense after *if* to talk about the future.

- *I’m not sure **if I’ll see her tomorrow**.* (not *~~… if I see her tomorrow.~~*)

## *say* and *tell*: answers, not questions

*Say* and *tell* are not used to report questions.

- not *~~The driver said whether I wanted the town centre.~~*

But *say* and *tell* can introduce the answers to questions.

- *Please **say whether you want** the town centre.*
- *He never **says where he’s going**.*
- *I **told** her **what time it was**.*
