# Indirect speech: tenses

## Past reporting verbs: *He said he didn’t like the party.*

When we report what somebody said or thought, it is usually natural to use different tenses from the original speaker (because we are most often talking at a different time).

- *``JAMES``* (on Saturday evening): I **don’t like** this party. I **want** to go home now. (present tenses)
- *``DANIEL``* (on Sunday morning): James said that he **didn’t like** the party, and he **wanted** to go home. (past tenses)

It would be strange for Daniel to say on Sunday *‘James said that he doesn’t like the party’*, just as it would be strange for Daniel to say, on Sunday, *‘James doesn’t like the party yesterday and goes home’*. The tenses used in indirect speech are usually just the tenses that are natural for the situation. Compare:

- *James **didn’t like** the party.*
- *James said he **didn’t like** the party.*
- *James wanted to go home because he **didn’t like** the party.*

The second sentence is an example of indirect speech, but it uses exactly the same tense as the other two: the one that is natural.

## Examples of natural tense changes after past reporting verbs

- **simple present → simple past**
  - ``DIRECT:`` *I **need** help.*
  - ``INDIRECT:`` *She thought she **needed** help.*

- **present progressive → past progressive**
  - ``DIRECT:`` *My English **is getting** better.*
  - ``INDIRECT:`` *I knew my English **was getting** better.*

- **present perfect → past perfect**
  - ``DIRECT:`` *This **has been** a wonderful trip.*
  - ``INDIRECT:`` *She told me that it **had been** a wonderful trip.*

- **past → past perfect**
  - ``DIRECT:`` *Anna **grew** up in Kenya.*
  - ``INDIRECT:`` *I found out that Anna **had grown** up in Kenya.*

- ***will → would***
  - ``DIRECT:`` *The exam **will** be difficult.*
  - ``INDIRECT:`` *They said that the exam **would** be difficult.*

- ****can → could****
  - ``DIRECT:`` *I **can** fly!*
  - ``INDIRECT:`` *Poor chap – he thought he **could** fly.*

- ****may → might****
  - ``DIRECT:`` *We **may** come back early.*
  - ``INDIRECT:`` *They said they **might** come back early.*

**Past perfect tenses do not change.**

- ``DIRECT:`` *I arrived late because I **had lost** the address.*
- ``INDIRECT:`` *He said he had arrived late because he **had lost** the address.*

## *would*, *could*, etc: no change

Past modal verbs are usually unchanged in indirect speech.

- ``DIRECT:`` *It **would** be nice if we **could** meet.*
- ``INDIRECT:`` *He said it **would** be nice if we **could** meet.*

## *I told them I was British.*

After past reporting verbs, we usually change the original tenses even if the things the original speaker said are still true.

- ``DIRECT:`` *I’**m** British.*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *I told the police I **was** British.* (The speaker is still British.)
- ``DIRECT:`` *You **can** use my car today.*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *Your mother said I **could** use her car today. Have you got the keys?*
- ``DIRECT:`` *How old **are** you?*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *Didn’t you hear me? I asked how old you **were**.*
- ``DIRECT:`` *That **is** my seat.*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *Sorry, I didn’t realise this **was** your seat.*

However, it is often also possible to keep the original speaker’s tenses in these cases.

- *Didn’t you hear me? I asked how old you **are**.*

## No tense change after *He says*, *I’ll tell her*, etc

After present, future and present perfect reporting verbs, tenses are usually the same as in the original (because there is no important change of time).

- ``DIRECT:`` *I **don’t** want to play any more.*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *He says he **doesn’t** want to play any more.*
- ``DIRECT:`` *We **need** some help.*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *I’ll tell her you **need** some help.*
- ``DIRECT:`` *Taxes **will** be raised.*  
  ``INDIRECT:`` *The government has announced that taxes **will** be raised.*
