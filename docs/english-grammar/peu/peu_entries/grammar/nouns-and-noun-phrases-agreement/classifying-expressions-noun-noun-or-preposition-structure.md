# Classifying expressions: noun + noun or preposition structure?

## Classifying expressions: *a sheepdog*

The noun + noun structure is mostly used to make ‘classifying’ expressions, which name a particular kind of thing.

- *mountain plants* (a special group of plants)
- *mineral water* (a sort of water)
- *a sheepdog* (a particular kind of dog)

We use noun + noun especially to talk about things that belong to common well-known classes (so that the two nouns really describe a single idea). In other cases we prefer a preposition structure. Compare:

- *the postman, the milkman* (well-known kinds of people who may call regularly at a British home)
- *a man from the health department* (not a regular kind of visitor)

More examples:

- *He was reading a **history book**.* (a common class of book)  
  *He was reading a **book about the moon**.* (not *~~a moon book~~*)
- *She was sitting at a **corner table** in the restaurant.* (Restaurants often have corner tables.)  
  *Who’s the **girl in the corner**?* (not *~~Who’s the corner girl?~~*)
- *What does that **road sign** say?*  
  *She was showing **signs of tiredness**.* (not *~~… tiredness signs.~~*)

## Containers: *a matchbox*; *a box of matches*

Noun + noun is used for particular kinds of container.

- *a matchbox*
- *a paint tin*
- *a coffee cup*

But we use the preposition structure (with *of*) to talk about a container together with its contents.

- *a box of matches*
- *a tin of paint*
- *a cup of coffee*

## Units, selections and collections: *piece*, *group*, etc

We also prefer the *of*\-structure with words that refer to units, selections and collections, like *piece*, *slice*, *lump* (of sugar), *bunch* (of flowers), *blade* (of grass), *pack* (of cards), *herd*, *flock*, *group* and so on.

- *a **piece of** paper* (not *~~a paper piece~~*)
- *a **bunch of** flowers* (not *~~a flower bunch~~*)

## ‘made of’: *a silk dress*; *silken skin*

Noun + noun is normally used to say what things are made of.

- *a silk dress*
- *a stone bridge*
- *an iron rod*
- *a gold ring*

In older English, the *of*\-structure was more common in this case (e.g. *a dress of silk*, *a bridge of stone*), and it is still used in some metaphorical expressions.

- *He rules his family with a **rod of iron**.*
- *The flowers were like a **carpet of gold**.*

A few pairs of nouns and adjectives (e.g. *gold*, *golden*) are used as modifiers with different meanings. Generally the noun simply names the material something is made of, while the adjective has a more metaphorical meaning. Compare:

- *a **gold** watch*
- ***silk** stockings*
- *a **lead** pipe*
- *a **stone** roof*
- ***golden** memories*
- ***silken** skin*
- *a **leaden** sky* (grey and depressing)
- *a **stony** silence*

But *wooden* and *woollen* just mean ‘made of wood/wool’.
