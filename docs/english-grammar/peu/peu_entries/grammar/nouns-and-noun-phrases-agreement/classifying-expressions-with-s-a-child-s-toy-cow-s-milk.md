# Classifying expressions with ’s: a child’s toy; cow’s milk

## Noun + ’s + noun: children’s clothes; a bird’s nest

In some classifying expressions we use a structure with possessive *’s*.

This is common when we are talking about things that are used by a person or animal: the first noun refers to the user.

- ***children’s** clothes*
- ***women’s** magazines*
- *a **man’s** sweater*
- *a **bird’s** nest*

Generally, either both nouns are singular or both are plural.

- *a **child’s toy***
- ***children’s clothes***
- but *a **women’s magazine***

Not all ‘used by’ expressions have possessive *’s*.

- ***baby** clothes*
- *a **bird**cage*

British and American usage sometimes differ. Compare:

- *a **baby’s** bottle* (BrE)
- *a **baby’s** pram* (BrE)
- *a **doll’s** house* (BrE)
- *a **baby** bottle* (AmE)
- *a **baby** carriage* (AmE)
- *a **doll** house* (AmE)

## Noun + *’s* + noun: *cow’s milk*; *a hen’s egg*

The *’s* structure is often used for products from living animals.

- ***cow’s** milk*
- ***sheep’s** wool*
- ***lamb’s** wool*
- *a **bird’s** egg*
- *a **hen’s** egg*
- (but *camel hair*, *horsehair*)

When the animal is killed to provide something, we usually use noun + noun.

- ***calf** skin*
- ***chicken** soup*
- ***chamois** leather*
- *a **lamb** chop*
- ***fox** fur*
- ***tortoise** shell*

## Parts: *a man’s leg*; *a table leg*

We use the *’s* structure to talk about parts of people’s and animals’ bodies.

- *a **man’s** leg*
- *an **elephant’s** trunk*
- *a **sheep’s** heart*

But to talk about parts of non-living things, we usually use the noun + noun structure.

- *a **table** leg* (not *~~a table’s leg~~*)
- *a **car** door* (not usually *~~a car’s door~~*)

## Pronunciation

Classifying expressions with possessive *’s* most often have the main stress on the first noun. Compare:

- *a ˈdoll’s house* (a kind of house)  
  *my brother’s ˈhouse* (not a kind of house)
- *ˈgoat’s milk* (a kind of milk)  
  *the goat’s ˈtail* (not a kind of tail)

Here, too, there are exceptions.

- *a child’s ˈbicycle* (a kind of bicycle)
