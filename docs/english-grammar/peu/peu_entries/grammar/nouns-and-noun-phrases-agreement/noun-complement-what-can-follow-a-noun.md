# Noun + complement: What can follow a noun?

Many nouns, especially abstract nouns, can be followed by ‘**complements’** – other words and expressions that ‘complete’ their meaning. These complements can be prepositional phrases, infinitive expressions or clauses (with or without prepositions).

- *Luke’s **criticism of the plan** made him very unpopular.*
- *I hate the **thought of leaving** you.*
- *Does she understand the **need to keep** everything secret?*
- *I admire your **belief that** you are always right.*
- *There’s still the **question of whether** we’re going to pay her.*

Many nouns can be followed by more than one kind of complement.

- *He didn’t give any **reason for the changes**.*
- *You’ve no **reason to get** angry.*
- *The main **reason why** I don’t believe her is this: …*

Not all nouns can be followed by all kinds of complement.

- *the **idea** **of** marriage*  
  *the **idea that** I might get married*  
  (but not *~~the idea to get married~~*)
- ***freedom to** choose*  
  ***freedom of** choice*  
  (but not *~~freedom of choosing~~*)

Note that a related noun and verb may have different kinds of complement.

- *I have no **intention of resigning**.*
- *I do not **intend to resign**.*

Nouns (possessive or not) can also act as modifiers of following nouns.

- ***my father’s** company*
- ***garden** furniture*

For details of noun + noun structures, [(see here)](./possessives-noun-s-forms).

Unfortunately, there is no easy way to decide which structures are possible after a particular noun. It is best to check in a good dictionary.
