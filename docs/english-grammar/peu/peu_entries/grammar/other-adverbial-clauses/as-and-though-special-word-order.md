# as and though: special word order

## Adjective/adverb/noun + *as* + clause

*As* and *though* can be used in a special structure after an adjective or adverb. In this case they both mean ‘although’, and suggest an emphatic contrast. (In American English only *as* is normally used like this; *though* is unusual.)

- ***Cold as/though** it was, we went out.* (= Although it was very cold, …)
- ***Bravely as/though** they fought, they had no chance of winning.*
- ***Much as/though** I respect your point of view, I can’t agree.*
- ***Strange as/though** it may seem, I don’t like watching cricket.*

After a noun, *though* can be used in this way (but not *as*).

- ***Scot though** she was, she supported the English team.*

Occasionally, the structure with *as* can be used to give a reason.

- ***Tired as** she was, I decided not to disturb her.* (= Because she was so tired …)

In American English, *as … as* is common.

- ***As cold as** it was, we went out.*
