# no matter who, etc

## Conjunction

*No matter* can be used with *who*, *whose*, *what*, *which*, *where*, *when* and *how*. These expressions are similar to conjunctions, and introduce adverbial clauses. The meaning is similar to ‘it is not important who/what, etc’.

- *I’ll love you **no matter what** you do.*
- ***No matter where** you go, I’ll follow you.*

We use a present tense with a future meaning after *no matter* [(see here)](./../conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/tense-simplification-in-subordinate-clauses).

- *No matter where you **go**, you’ll find people who love music.*
- *You’ll be welcome no matter when you **come**.*

## *no matter who*, etc and *whoever*, etc

The expressions *no matter who*/*what*, etc are used rather like *whoever*, *whatever*, etc [(see here)](./whoever-whatever-etc). Compare:

- ***No matter what** you say, I won’t believe you.*  
  ***Whatever** you say, I won’t believe you.*
- *Call me when you arrive, **no matter how** late it is.*  
  *Call me when you arrive, **however** late it is.*

However, clauses with *whoever*/*whatever*/*whichever* can be used as subjects or objects. Clauses with *no matter who*, etc cannot be used in this way.

- ***Whatever you do** is fine with me.* (but not *~~No matter what you do is fine with me.~~*)
- *You can have **whichever you like**.* (but not *~~You can have no matter which you like.~~*)

## *no matter* and *it doesn’t matter*

Because *no matter who*, etc act like conjunctions, they must be used with two clauses.

- ***No matter when** you come, you’ll be welcome.* (but not *~~No matter when you come.~~*)

To introduce just one clause, we can use *It doesn’t matter*.

- ***It doesn’t matter** when you come.*

## No matter what

*No matter what* can be used at the end of a clause, without a following verb.

- *I’ll always love you, **no matter what**.* (= … no matter what happens.)
