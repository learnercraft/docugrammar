# whoever, whatever, etc

## Meaning and use

*Whoever* means ‘it doesn’t matter who’, ‘any person who’, or ‘the unknown person who’. *Whatever*, *whichever*, *however*, *whenever* and *wherever* have similar ‘open’ meanings.

Clauses beginning with these words can act as adverbials.

- *I’m not opening the door, **whoever** you are.*
- ***Whatever** you do, I’ll always love you.*
- *Keep calm, **whatever** happens.*
- *We’re free all next week. You’ll be welcome **whichever** day you come.*
- ***However** much he eats, he never gets fat.*
- *People always want more, **however** rich they are.*
- ***Whenever** I go to London I try to see Vicky.*
- *You can come **whenever** you like.*

With these conjunctions we use present tenses when talking about the future.

- *Whichever of them you **marry**, you’ll have problems.*
- *However you **travel**, it’ll take you at least three days.*
- *Wherever you **go**, you’ll find Coca-Cola.*

## *whoever*, *whichever* and *whatever*: subjects and objects

*Whoever*, *whichever* and *whatever* can be the subjects or objects of the verbs in their clauses. (Note that *whomever* is not used in modern English.)

- ***Whoever** directed this film, it’s no good.* (subject of *directed*)
- ***Whoever** you marry, make sure he can cook.* (object of *marry*)
- ***Whatever** you say, I don’t think he’s the right man.* (object of *say*)

*Whichever* and *whatever* can also go with nouns as determiners.

- ***Whichever room** you use, make sure you clean it up afterwards.*
- ***Whatever problems** you have, you can always come to me for help.*
- *If you change your mind for **whatever reason**, just let me know.*

## Clauses as subjects or objects

A clause with *whoever*, *whichever* or *whatever* can be not only an adverbial, but also a subject or object in the other clause.

- ***Whoever told you that** was lying.* (subject of *was lying*)
- *I’ll marry **whoever I like**.* (object of *marry*)
- *Send it to **whoever pays the bills**.* (object of *to*)
- ***Whichever climber gets to the top first** will get a £5,000 prize.* (subject of *will get*)
- *I’ll take **whichever tent you’re not using**.* (object of *take*)
- ***Whatever you want** is fine with me.* (subject of *is*)
- *Prisoners have to eat **whatever they’re given**.* (object of *eat*)

## *whenever* = ‘every time that’

*Whenever* can suggest repetition, in the sense of ‘every time that’.

- ***Whenever** I see you I feel nervous.*
- *I stay with Monica **whenever** I go to London.*

## *whoever*, etc … *may*

*May* can be used to suggest ignorance or uncertainty.

- *He’s written a book on the philosopher Matilda Vidmi, **whoever** she **may** be.*
- *She’s just written to me from Llandyfrdwy, **wherever** that **may** be.*

## Leaving out the verb: *whatever his problems*

In a clause like *whatever his problems are*, where *whatever* is the complement of the verb *be*, it is possible to leave out the verb.

- ***Whatever his problems**, he has no right to behave like that.*
- *A serious illness, **whatever its nature**, is almost always painful.*

After *however* + adjective, we can leave out a pronoun + *be*.

- *A grammar rule, **however true** (it is), is useless unless it can be understood.*

## Informal uses: short answers

In an informal style, these conjunctions are sometimes used as short answers.

- *‘When shall we start?’ ‘**Whenever**.’* (= Whenever you like.)
- *‘Potatoes or rice?’ ‘**Whichever**.’* (= I don’t mind.)

*Whatever* is often used to mean ‘I don’t care’ or ‘I’m not interested’. This can sound rude.

- *‘What would you like to do? We could go and see a film, or go swimming.’ ‘**Whatever**.’*

*Or whatever* can mean ‘or anything else’.

- *Would you like some orange juice or a beer **or whatever**?*
- *If you play football or tennis **or whatever**, it does take up a lot of time.*

## *whatever* meaning ‘at all’

After *any* and *no*, *whatever* can be used in British English to mean ‘at all’.

- *Don’t you have **any** regrets **whatever**?*
- *I can see **no** point **whatever** in buying it.*

In American English, *whatsoever* is preferred in this sense; in British English it is a formal alternative.
