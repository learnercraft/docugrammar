# *by* + agent

In a passive clause, we usually use *by* to introduce the agent â€“ the person or thing that does the action, or that causes what happens. (Note, however, that agents are mentioned in only about 20 per cent of passive clauses.)

- *All the trouble was caused **by your mother**.*
- *These carpets are made **by children** who work twelve hours a day.*

Some past participles can be more like adjectives than verbs [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles/participles-ing-and-ed-forms-used-like-adjectives): for example *shocked*, *worried*, *frightened*. After these, we often use other prepositions instead of *by*. (And such structures are not really passives, but examples of *be* + adjective.)

- *I was **shocked at**/**by** your attitude.*
- *We were **worried about**/**by** her silence.*
- *Are you **frightened of** spiders?*

*With* is used when we talk about an instrument which is used by an agent to do an action [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/by-method-agent-and-with-tools-etc).

- *He was shot (by the policeman) **with a rifle**.*
