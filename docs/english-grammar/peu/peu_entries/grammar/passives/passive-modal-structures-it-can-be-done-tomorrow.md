# Passive modal structures: *It can be done tomorrow.*

Modal structures can be passivised.

- *We **can do** it tomorrow.* → *It **can be done** tomorrow.*
- *They **may close** the hospital.* → *The hospital **may be closed**.*

An interesting, rather complicated point about modal verbs is that their meaning usually ‘spreads over’ a whole clause. This means that one can change a modal structure from active to passive, for example, without affecting the meaning very much. Compare:

- *A child **could understand** his theory.*  
  *His theory **could be understood** by a child.*
- *You **shouldn’t put** adverbs between the verb and the object.*  
  *Adverbs **shouldn’t be put** between the verb and the object.*
- *Dogs **may** chase cats.*  
  *Cats **may get chased** by dogs.*

With most other verbs that are followed by infinitives, their meaning is attached to the subject, so that a change from active to passive changes the sense of the sentence completely. Compare:

- *Dogs **like to chase** cats.*  
  *Cats **like to be chased** by dogs.* (different and – of course – untrue)
- *Dan **wants to phone** Anna.*  
  *Anna **wants to be phoned** by Dan.* (not the same meaning)
