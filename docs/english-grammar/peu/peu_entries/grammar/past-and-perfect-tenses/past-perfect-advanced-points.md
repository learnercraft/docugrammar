# Past perfect: advanced points

## Past perfect or simple past with *after*, *as soon as*, etc

We can use time conjunctions (e.g. *after*, *as soon as*, *when*, *once*) to talk about two actions or events that happened one after the other. Usually the past perfect is not necessary in these cases, because we are not ‘going back’ from the time that we are mainly talking about, but simply moving forward from one event to the next.

- ***After** it **got** dark, we came back inside.*
- ***As soon as** Megan **arrived**, we sat down to eat.*
- ***Once** it **stopped** raining, we started the game again.*

However, we can use the past perfect with *after*, *as soon as*, etc to emphasise that the first action is separate, independent of the second, completed before the second started.

- *She didn’t feel the same **after** her dog **had died**.*
- ***As soon as** he **had finished** his exams, he went to Paris for a month.*

This use of the past perfect is especially common with *when*. (*When* has several meanings, so we often have to show the exact time relations by the verb form.) Compare:

- *When I **had opened** the windows, I sat down and had a cup of tea.* (not *~~When I opened the windows, I sat down …~~*: the first action was quite separate from the second.)  
  *When I **opened** the window, the cat jumped out.* (More natural than *When I had opened the window, …*: one action caused the other.)
- *When I **had answered** my emails, I did some gardening.* (not *~~When I answered my emails, I did some gardening.~~*)  
  *When I **wrote** to her, she came at once.*

## Unrealised hopes and wishes; things that did not happen

The past perfect can be used to express an unrealised hope, wish, etc. *Had* is usually stressed in this case.

- *I **``HAD`` hoped** we would leave tomorrow, but it won’t be possible.*
- *He **``HAD`` intended** to make a cake, but he ran out of time.*

## Past perfect with *It was the first/second … that …*

We generally use a past perfect after *it was the first/second … that …* and similar structures [(see here)](./this-is-the-first-last-etc).

- *It was **the first time** that I **had heard** her sing.*
- *It was **the fifth time** she **had asked** the same question.*
- *It was only **the second opera** I **had seen** in my life.*

:::note

For the past perfect with *before* (e.g. *He went out before I had finished my sentence*), [(see here)](./../other-adverbial-clauses/before-conjunction#perfect-tenses).
