## Use: *What were you doing at eight o’clock?*

We use the past progressive to say that something was in progress (going on) around a particular past time.

- *‘What **were** you **doing** at eight o’clock yesterday evening?’ ‘I **was watching** TV. ’* (not *~~What did you do …? I watched TV.~~*)
- *When I got up this morning the sun **was shining**, the birds **were singing**, …* (not *~~… the sun shone, the birds sang …~~*)

## Past progressive and simple past: ‘background’ events

We often use the past progressive together with a simple past tense. The past progressive refers to a longer ‘background’ action or situation; the simple past refers to a shorter action or event that happened in the middle of the longer action, or that interrupted it.

- *As I **was walking** down the road, I **saw** James.*
- *The phone **rang** while I **was having** dinner.*
- *Mozart **died** while he **was composing** the Requiem.*

## Not used for repeated actions

The past progressive is not the normal tense for talking about repeated or habitual past actions. The simple past is usually used with this meaning.

- *I **rang** the bell six times.* (not *~~I was ringing the bell six times.~~*)
- *When I was a child we **walked** to school.* (not *~~… we were walking to school.~~*)

However, the past progressive is possible if the repeated actions form a ‘background’ for the main action.

- *At the time when it happened, I **was travelling** to New York a lot.*

## Non-progressive verbs: *She said she believed*

Some verbs are not often used in progressive forms [(see here)](./../verbs/non-progressive-verbs).

- *She said she **believed** Joe was dying.* (not *~~She said she was believing …~~*)

## Used for shorter, temporary actions and situations

The past progressive, like other progressive forms [(see here)](./../verbs/progressive-structures), is used for temporary actions and situations. When we talk about longer, more permanent situations we use the simple past. Compare:

- *It happened while I **was living** in Eastbourne last year.*  
  *I **lived** in London for ten years while I was a child.*
- *When I got home, water **was running** down the kitchen walls.*  
  *When they first discovered the river, they thought it **ran** into the Atlantic.*

## Special uses

Because we often use the past progressive to talk about something that is a ‘background’, not the main ‘news’, we can make something seem less important by using this tense. Compare:

- *I **had lunch** with the President yesterday.* (important piece of news)
- *I **was having lunch** with the President yesterday, and she said …* (as if there was nothing special for the speaker about lunching with the President)

The past progressive is quite often used with verbs of saying: this gives more relative importance to the following verb – to what is said.

- *Jack **was saying** that he still can’t find a job.*

With *always*, *continually* and similar words, the past progressive can be used for things that happened repeatedly and unexpectedly or in an unplanned way [(see here)](./../verbs/progressive-with-always-etc).

- *Aunt Lucy **was always turning up** without warning and bringing us presents.*
- *I didn’t like him – he **was continually borrowing** money.*
