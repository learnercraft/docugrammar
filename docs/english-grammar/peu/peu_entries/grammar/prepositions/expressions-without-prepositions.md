# Expressions without prepositions

This is a list of some common expressions in which we do not use prepositions, or can leave them out.

## *discuss*, *emphasise*, *enter*, *marry*, *lack*, *resemble* and *approach*

These verbs are normally followed by direct objects without prepositions.

- *We must **discuss your plans**.* (not *~~… discuss about your plans.~~*)
- *The Minister **emphasised the need** for secrecy.* (not *~~… emphasised on the need …~~*)
- *Conversation stopped as we **entered the church**.* (not *~~… entered in(to) the church.~~*)
- *She **married a friend** of her sister’s.* (not *~~… married with …~~*)
- *He’s clever, but he **lacks experience**.* (not *~~… lacks of …~~*)
- *The child does not **resemble either** of its parents.* (not *~~… resemble to …~~*)
- *The train is now **approaching London**.* (not *~~… approaching to …~~*)

Note that the related nouns must have prepositions before complements:

- *discussion **of***
- *resemblance **to***
- *emphasis **on***
- *approach **to***
- *entry **into***
- *marriage **to***
- *experience **of***

## *next*, *last*, etc

Prepositions are not used before a number of common expressions of time beginning *next*, *last*, *this*, *that* (sometimes), *one*, *every*, *each*, *some*, *any* (in an informal style), *all*.

- *See you **next Monday**.* (not *~~… on next Monday.~~*)
- *The meeting’s **this Thursday**.*
- *We met **one Tuesday** in August.*
- *I’ll never forget meeting you **that afternoon**.*
- *Come **any day** you like.*
- *The party lasted **all night**.*

Note also *tomorrow morning*, *yesterday afternoon*, etc.

## Days of the week

In an informal style, we sometimes leave out *on* before the names of the days of the week.

- *Why don’t you come for a drink **(on) Monday** evening?*

## *a* meaning ‘each’

No preposition is used in expressions like *three times a day*, *sixty miles an hour*, *eighty pence a kilo*.

- *Private lessons cost £20 **an hour**.*

:::note

For *per* in expressions like these, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/vocabulary-areas/numbers#before-nouns).

## *What time …?*, etc

We usually leave out *at* before *what time*.

- ***What time** does Granny’s train arrive?* (More natural than *At what time …?* )

In an informal style, we can also leave out *on* before *what*/*which day(s)*.

- ***What day** is your hair appointment?*
- ***Which day** do you have your music lesson?*

## *about*

In an informal style, *at* is often dropped before *about* + time expression.

- *I’ll see you **(at) about three o’clock**.*

## ‘how long’

In an informal style, *for* is often left out in expressions that say how long something lasts.

- *I’ve been here **(for) three weeks** now.*
- ***How long** are you staying **(for)**?*

## Measurement expressions, etc after *be*

Expressions containing words like *height*, *weight*, *length*, *size*, *shape*, *age*, *colour* are usually connected to the subject of the clause by the verb *be*, without a preposition.

- *He **is just the right height** to be a police officer.*
- *She’**s the same age** as me.*
- *His head’**s a funny shape**.*
- *I’**m the same weight** as I was twenty years ago.*
- ***What shoe size are** you?*
- ***What colour are** her eyes?* (not *~~Of what colour …?~~*)

## *(in) this way*, etc

We often leave out *in* (especially in informal speech) in expressions like *(in) this way*, *(in) the same way*, *(in) another way*, etc.

- *They plant corn **(in) the same way** their ancestors used to 500 years ago.*

## *home*

We do not use *to* before *home* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/home).

- *I’m going **home**.*

In informal English (especially American), *at* can be left out before *home*.

- *Is anybody **home**?*

## *place*

In an informal style, *to* can be dropped in some expressions with the word *place*. This is normal in American English.

- *Let’s go **(to) some place** where it’s quiet.*
- *I always said you’d go **places**.* (= become successful)

## Infinitive structures

Prepositions can sometimes be dropped in the structure noun + infinitive + preposition [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/infinitives-after-nouns-and-pronouns-my-decision-to-leave#infinitive-with-preposition-a-friend-to-play-with).

- *She has no **money to buy food (with)**.*
- *We have **an hour to do it (in)**.*

This is particularly common with the noun *place*.

- *We need **a place to live (in)**.*
- *She had **no place to go (to)**.*
