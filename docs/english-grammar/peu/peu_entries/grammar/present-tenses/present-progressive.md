# Present progressive

## Present progressive: forms

:::tip[Grammar]

*am*/*are*/*is* + *-ing*

:::

- *I am waiting.*
- *Are you listening?*
- *She isn’t working today.*

:::note

For spelling of *-ing* forms, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-formation-and-spelling/final-e).

For passive forms (e.g. *The work **is being done***), [(see here)](./../passives/passive-structures-and-verb-forms).

:::

## Use: ‘around now’

We use the present progressive to talk about temporary situations that are going on now or ‘around now’: before, during and after the moment of speaking.

- *Hurry up! We’**re** all **waiting** for you!* (not *~~We all wait …~~*)
- *‘What **are** you **doing**?’ ‘I’**m writing** emails.’* (not *~~… I write emails.~~*)
- *He’**s working** in Saudi Arabia at the moment.*

## Repeated actions

The present progressive can refer to repeated actions and events, if these are just happening around the present (for more details, [(see here)](./present-tenses-advanced-points#repeated-actions-simple-or-progressive).

- *Why **is** he **hitting** the dog?*
- *I’**m travelling** a lot these days.*

## Changes

We also use the present progressive to talk about developments and changes.

- *That child’**s getting** bigger every day.*
- *House prices **are going** up again.*

## Talking about the future

We often use the present progressive to talk about the future [(see here)](./../talking-about-the-future/present-progressive-for-future).

- *What **are** you **doing** tomorrow evening?*
- *Come and see us next week if you’**re passing** through London.*

## Things that happen all the time: present progressive not used

We do not normally use the present progressive to talk about permanent situations, or about things that happen regularly, repeatedly or all the time. Compare:

- *Look – the cat’**s eating** your breakfast!*  
  *‘What **do** bears **eat**?’ ‘Everything.’* (not *~~‘What are bears eating? …’~~*)
- *Why **is** that girl **standing** on the table?*  
  *Chetford Castle **stands** on a hill outside the town.* (not *~~… is standing …~~*)
- *My sister’**s living** at home for the moment.*  
  *Your parents **live** in North London, don’t they?*

## Verbs not generally used in progressive forms

Some verbs are not generally used in progressive forms [(see here)](./../verbs/non-progressive-verbs), even if the meaning is ‘just around now’.

- *I **like** this wine.* (not *~~I’m liking this wine.~~*)
- ***Do** you **believe** what he says?* (not *~~Are you believing …?~~*)
- *The tank **contains** about 7,000 litres at the moment.*

## *how long*? present tenses not used

We use a perfect tense, not a present tense, to say how long something has been going on. [(see here)](./../past-and-perfect-tenses/present-perfect-or-present) for details.)

- *I’**ve been learning** English for years.* (not *~~I’m learning English for years.~~*)
