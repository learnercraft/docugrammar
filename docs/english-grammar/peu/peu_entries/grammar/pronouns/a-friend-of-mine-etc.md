# *a friend of mine*, etc

We cannot usually put a possessive between another determiner and a noun. We can say *my friend*, *Anna’s friend*, *a friend* or *that friend*, but not *~~a my friend~~* or *~~that Anna’s friend~~*. Instead, we use a structure with *of* + possessive.

:::tip[Grammar]

determiner + noun + *of* + possessive

:::

- *That policeman is **a friend of mine**.*
- *How’s **that brother of yours**?*
- *He’s **a cousin of the Queen’s**.*
- *She’s **a friend of my father’s**.*
- *Have you heard **this new idea of the boss’s**?*
- *My work is **no business of yours**.*
- *I met **another boyfriend of Lucy’s** yesterday.*

The structure has a variant in which a noun does not have possessive *’s*: this is sometimes used when talking about relationships.

- *He’s **a cousin of the Queen**.*
- *She’s **a friend of my father**.*

The word *own* is used in a similar structure [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/own).

- *I wish I had **a room of my own**.*
