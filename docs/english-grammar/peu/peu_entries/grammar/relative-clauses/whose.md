# whose

## Relative possessive

*Whose* is a relative possessive word, used as a determiner before nouns in the same way as *his*, *her*, *its* or *their*. It can refer back to people or things. In a relative clause, *whose* + noun can be the subject, the object of a verb or the object of a preposition.

- *I saw a girl **whose beauty** took my breath away.* (subject)
- *It was a meeting **whose purpose** I did not understand.* (object)
- *Michel Croz, **with whose help** Whymper climbed the Matterhorn, was one of the first professional guides.* (object of preposition)
- *I went to see my friends the Forrests, **whose children** I used to look **after** when they were small.* (object of preposition)

*Whose* can be used in both identifying and non-identifying clauses.

## Things: *of which*; *that … of*

Instead of *whose*, we can use *of which* or *that … of* (less formal) to refer to things, and these are sometimes preferred. The most common word order is noun + *of which* or *that … of*, but *of which …* + noun is also possible. Compare the following four ways of expressing the same idea.

- *He’s written a book **whose name** I’ve forgotten.*
- *He’s written a book **the name of which** I’ve forgotten.*
- *He’s written a book **that** I’ve forgotten **the name of**.*
- *He’s written a book **of which** I’ve forgotten **the name**.*

We do not normally use noun + *of whom* in a possessive sense to talk about people.

- *a man whose name I’ve forgotten* (not *~~a man of whom I’ve forgotten the name~~*)

## Only used as a determiner

Relative *whose* is only used as a possessive determiner, before a noun. In other cases we use *of which*/*whom* or *that … of*.

- *He’s married to a singer **of whom** you may have heard. or … **that** you may have heard **of**.* (not *~~… a singer whose you may have heard.~~*)

## Formality

Sentences with *whose* are generally felt to be rather heavy and formal; in an informal style other structures are often preferred. *With* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/with) is a common way of expressing possessive ideas, and is usually more natural than *whose* in descriptions.

- *I’ve got some friends **with a** house that looks over a river.* (Less formal than *… whose house looks over a river.*)
- *You know that girl **with a** brother who drives buses?* (Less formal than *… whose brother drives buses?*)
- *She’s married to the man over there **with the** enormous ears.* (More natural than *… the man over there whose ears are enormous.*)
