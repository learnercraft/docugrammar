# Declarative questions: *That’s the boss?*

In spoken questions, we do not always put an auxiliary verb before the subject.

- ***You’re** working late tonight?*

These ‘declarative questions’ are often used when the speaker thinks he/she knows or has understood something, but wants to make sure or express surprise. A rising intonation is common.

- ***This is** your car?* (= I suppose this is your car, isn’t it?)
- ***That’s** the boss? I thought he was the cleaner.*
- *‘We’re going to Hull for the weekend.’ ‘**You’re going** to Hull?’*

This word order is not normally possible after a question word.

- ***Where are you** going?* (not *~~Where you are going?~~*)
