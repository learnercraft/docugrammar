# Echo questions: *She’s invited how many?*

## *You’re getting married?*

To question what has been said, a speaker may simply repeat (‘echo’) what he/she has heard. A rising intonation is common.

- *‘I’m getting married.’ ‘**You’re getting married?**’*

## *Take a look at what?*

To question one part of a sentence, we can repeat the rest of the sentence, and put a stressed question word in place of the part we are asking about.

- *‘Just take a look at that.’ ‘Take a look at **what?**’*
- *‘She’s invited thirteen people to dinner.’ ‘She’s invited **how many?**’*
- *‘We’re going to Tierra del Fuego for a month.’ ‘You’re going **where?**’*
- *‘I’ve broken the fettle gauge.’ ‘You’ve broken the **what?**’*

To question a verb, or the part of a sentence beginning with the verb, *do what* is used.

- *‘She set fire to the garage.’ ‘**She did what** (to the garage)?’*

## Repeating a question: *Where am I going? Home.*

A speaker may question a question, by repeating it with a rising intonation. Note that we use normal question structures with inverted word order, not indirect question structures, in this case.

- *‘Where are you going?’ ‘**Where am I going?** Home.’* (not *~~… Where I’m going? …~~*)
- *‘What does he want?’ ‘**What does he want?** Money, as usual.’* (not *~~… What he wants? …~~*)
- *‘Are you tired?’ ‘**Am I tired?** Of course not.’* (not *~~… Whether I’m tired? …~~*)
- *‘Do squirrels eat insects?’ ‘**Do squirrels eat insects?** I’m not sure.’* (not *~~… Whether squirrels eat insects? …~~*)
