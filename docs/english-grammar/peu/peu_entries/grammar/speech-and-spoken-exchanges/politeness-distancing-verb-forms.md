# Politeness: distancing verb forms

## Past tenses: *How much did you want to spend?*

We can make requests (and also questions, suggestions and statements) less direct (and so more polite) by using verb forms that suggest ‘distance’ from the immediate present reality. Past tenses are often used to do this.

- *How much **did** you **want** to spend, sir?* (meaning ‘How much do you want to spend?’)
- *How many days **did** you **intend** to stay?* (meaning ‘… do you intend …’)
- *I **wondered** if you **were** free this evening.*

## Progressives: *I’m hoping …*

Progressive forms can be used in the same way. They sound more casual and less definite than simple forms, because they suggest something temporary and incomplete.

- *I’**m hoping** you can lend me £10.* (less definite than *I hope …*)
- *What time **are** you **planning** to arrive?* (more casual-sounding than *Please let us know what time you plan to arrive*.)
- *I’**m looking forward** to seeing you again.* (more casual than *I look forward …*)
- *I’m afraid we must **be going**.*

Past progressives give two levels of distancing.

- *Good morning. I **was wondering**: do you need help moving that stuff?*
- ***Were** you **looking** for anything special?* (in a shop)
- *I **was thinking** – what about borrowing Jake’s car?*

## Future: *You’ll need to* …

Another way to distance something is to displace it into the future. *Will need / have to* can be used to soften instructions and orders.

- *I’**ll have to** ask you to wait a minute.*

And *will* is sometimes used to say how much money is owed.

- *That **will be** £1.65, please.*

Future progressive verbs are often used to enquire politely about people’s plans [(see here)](./../talking-about-the-future/future-progressive).

- ***Will** you **be going** away this summer?*

## Modal verbs: *would*, *could* and *might*

The modal verbs *would*, *could* and *might* also make questions, requests and suggestions less direct.

- *I thought it **would** be nice to have a picnic.*
- *Hi! I thought I’**d** come over and introduce myself. My name’s Andy.*
- ***Could** you give me a hand?*
- ***Could** I ask you to translate this for me?*
- *We **could** ask Daniel to help us.*
- *I was wondering if you **might** be interested in a game of tennis.*
- *‘I came in and ordered some shoes from you.’ ‘Oh yes, sir. When **would** that have been, exactly?’*

*Would* is very often used to form requests and offers with verbs like *like* and *prefer*.

- *What **would** you **like** to drink?*

Note the common use of *would* before verbs of saying and thinking, to make a statement sound less definite.

- *I **would say** we’d do better to catch the earlier train.*
- *This is what I **would call** annoying.*
- *I **would think** we might stop for lunch soon.*
- *I’m surprised you didn’t like the film. I **would have thought** it was just your kind of thing.*
- *We **would ask** passengers to have their tickets ready for inspection.*

## Conditional and negative expressions

Another way of distancing suggestions from reality is to make them conditional or negative.

- *It would be better **if** we turned it the other way up.*
- *What **if** we stayed at home for a change?*
- ***Suppose** I gave Alice a call?*
- ***If** you would come this way …*
- *I wonder **if** you could lend me £5?*
- *I **don’t suppose** you want to buy a car, do you?*
- *You **wouldn’t like** to come out with us, by any chance?*
- *You **couldn’t take** the children to school, could you?* (but not *~~Couldn’t you take the children to school?~~* This sounds like a complaint, [(see here)](./politeness-using-questions#negative-questions).)
