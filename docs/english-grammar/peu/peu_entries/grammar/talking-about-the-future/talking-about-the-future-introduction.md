# Introduction

There are several ways to use verbs to talk about the future in English. This is a complicated area of grammar: the differences between the meanings and uses of the different structures are not easy to analyse and describe clearly. In many, but not all situations, two or more structures are possible with similar meanings.

## Present-tense forms: *I’m leaving*; *I’m going to leave*

When we talk about future events which have some present reality – which have already been planned or decided, or which we can see are on the way – we often use present-tense forms. The present progressive is common. For details, [(see here)](./present-progressive-for-future).

- *I’**m seeing** Jack tomorrow.*
- *What **are** you **doing** this evening?*

The present progressive of *go* (*be going to* …) is often used as an auxiliary verb to talk about the future. For details, [(see here)](./going-to).

- *Sandra **is going to have** a baby.*
- *When **are** you **going to get** a job?*

These present forms are especially common in speech (because conversation is often about future events which are already planned, or which we can see are on the way).

## *will/shall*

When we are simply giving information about the future, or talking about possible future events which are not already decided or obviously on the way, we usually use *will (or sometimes shall)* + infinitive. This is the most common way of talking about the future. For details, [(see here)](./will).

- *Nobody **will** ever **know** the truth.*
- *I think Liverpool **will win**.*

*Will* (and sometimes *shall*) are also used to express our intentions and attitudes towards other people: they are common in offers, requests, threats, promises and announcements of decisions. For details, [(see here)](./../modal-auxiliary-verbs/willingness-will-can).

- ***Shall** I **carry** your bag?*
- *I’**ll** **hit** you if you do that again.*

## Simple present: *the train leaves …*

The simple present can also be used to talk about the future, but only in certain situations. For details, [(see here)](./simple-present-for-future).

- *The train **leaves** at half past six tomorrow morning.*

## Other ways of talking about the future

We can use the future perfect to say that something will be completed, finished or achieved by a certain time. For details, [(see here)](./future-perfect).

- *By next Christmas we’**ll have been** here for eight years.*

The future progressive can be used to say that something will be in progress at a particular time. For details, and other uses of this tense, [(see here)](./future-progressive).

- *This time tomorrow I’**ll be lying** on the beach.*

*Be about to* + infinitive [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/about-to) suggests that a future event is very close.

- *The plane’**s about to take off**.*

*Be to* + infinitive is used to talk about plans, arrangements and schedules, and to give instructions. For details, [(see here)](./be-to-infinitive-i-am-to-you-are-to-etc).

- *The President **is to visit** Beijing.*
- *You’**re not to tell** anybody.*

## ‘future in the past’

To say that something was still in the future at a certain past time, we can use a past form of one of the future structures. For details, [(see here)](./future-in-the-past).

- *Something **was going to** happen that **was to** change the world.*
- *I knew she **would** arrive before long.*

## Subordinate clauses

In many subordinate clauses we refer to the future with present tenses instead of *will* + infinitive. For details, [(see here)](./../conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/tense-simplification-in-subordinate-clauses).

- *Phone me when you **have** time.* (not *~~… when you’ll have time.~~*)
- *I’ll follow him wherever he **goes**.* (not *~~… wherever he’ll go.~~*)
