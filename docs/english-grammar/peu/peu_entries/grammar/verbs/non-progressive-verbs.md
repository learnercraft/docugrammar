# Non-progressive verbs

## Verbs not often used in progressive (‘continuous’) forms

Some verbs are not often used in progressive forms.

- *I **like** this music.* (not ~~*I’m liking this music.*~~)
- *I called her because I **needed** to talk.* (not *... ~~because I was needing to talk~~.*)

Some other verbs are not used in progressive forms when they have certain meanings (see below). Compare:

- *I’**m seeing** the doctor at ten o’clock.*
- *I **see** what you mean.* (not ~~*I’m seeing what you mean.*~~)

Many of these non-progressive verbs refer to states rather than actions. Some refer to mental states (e.g. *know*, *think*, *believe*); some others refer to the use of the senses (e.g. *smell*, *taste*).

Modal verbs (e.g. *can*, *must*) have no progressive forms, [(see here)](./../modal-auxiliary-verbs/modals-grammar-pronunciation-and-contractions#grammar).

- *The water **tastes** / **is tasting** better today.*
- *As I get older, I **remember** / I’**m remembering** less and less.*

*Need*, *want* and *mean* can have future or present perfect progressive uses.

- ***Will*** *you **be needing** the car this afternoon?*
- *I’**ve been wanting** to go to Australia for years.*
- *I’**ve been meaning** to tell you about Andrew. He ...*

## *can see*, etc

*Can* is often used with *see*, *hear*, *feel*, *taste*, *smell*, *understand* and *remember* to give a kind of progressive meaning, especially in British English [(see here)](./../modal-auxiliary-verbs/can-and-could-with-see-hear-etc).

- *I **can see** Emma coming down the road.*
- ***Can** you **smell** something burning?*

## *-ing* forms

Even verbs which are never used in progressive tenses have *-ing* forms which can be used in other kinds of structure.

- ***Knowing*** *her tastes, I bought her a large box of chocolates.*
- *You can respect people’s views without **agreeing** with them.*
