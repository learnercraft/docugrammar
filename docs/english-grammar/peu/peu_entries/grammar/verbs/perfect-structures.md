# Perfect structures

## Construction

Perfect verb forms are made with ***have* + past participle**.

- *She **has lost** her memory.* (present perfect)
- *I told him that I **had** never **heard** of the place.* (past perfect)
- *When I went back to the village the house **had been pulled** down.* (past perfect passive)
- *We **will have finished** by tomorrow afternoon.* (future perfect tense)
- *I’m sorry **to have disturbed** you.* (perfect infinitive)
- ***Having seen*** *the film, I don’t want to read the book.* (perfect *-ing* form)

Perfect and progressive forms can be combined.

- *They **have been living** in Portugal for the last year.* (present perfect progressive)

## Terminology and use

A perfect verb form generally shows the time of an event as being earlier than some other time (past, present or future). But a perfect does not only show the time of an event. It also shows how the speaker sees the event—perhaps as being connected to a later event, or as being completed by a certain time. Because of this, academic grammars often talk about ‘perfect aspect’ rather than ‘perfect tenses’.
