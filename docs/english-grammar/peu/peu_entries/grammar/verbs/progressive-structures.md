# Progressive structures

## Construction

Progressive verb structures (also called ‘continuous’) are made with ***be* + *-ing*.**

- *I **am waiting** for the shops to open.* (present progressive)
- *Your suit **is being cleaned**.* (present progressive passive)
- *She phoned while I **was cooking**.* (past progressive)
- ***Will*** *you **be going** out this evening?* (future progressive)
- *I’d like **to be lying** on the beach now.* (progressive infinitive)

Progressive and perfect forms can be combined.

- *I didn’t know how long she **had been sitting** there.* (past perfect progressive)

## Terminology and use

A progressive does not simply show the time of an event. It also shows how the speaker sees the event—generally as ongoing and temporary, not completed or permanent. (Because of this, grammars often talk about ‘progressive aspect’ rather than ‘progressive tenses’.) Compare:

- *I’**ve read** your email.* (completed action)  
  *I’**ve been reading** a lot of thrillers recently.* (not necessarily completed)

- *The Rhine **runs** into the North Sea.* (permanent)  
  *We’ll have to phone the plumber—water’**s running** down the kitchen wall.* (temporary)

When a progressive is used to refer to a short momentary action, it often suggests repetition.

- *Why **are** you **jumping** up and down?*
- *The door **was banging** in the wind.*

## Distancing: *I was wondering ...*

Progressives can make requests, questions and statements less direct. (They sound less definite than simple forms, because they suggest something temporary and incomplete.)

- *I’**m hoping** you can lend me £10.* (less definite than *I hope ...*)
- *What time **are** you **planning** to arrive?*
- *I’**m looking** forward to seeing you again.*
- *I’m afraid we must **be going**.*
- *I **was wondering** if you had two single rooms.*
- *Will you **be going** away at the weekend?*
