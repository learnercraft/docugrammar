# Abbreviated styles

Some styles of writing and speech have their own special grammar rules, often because of the need to save space or time.

## Advertisements and instructions

Small ads and instructions often leave out articles, subject or object pronouns, forms of *be* and prepositions.

- *Single man looking for flat Oxford area. Phone 806127 weekends.*
- *Job needed urgently. Will do anything legal. Call 312654.*
- *Pour mixture into large saucepan, heat until boiling, then add three pounds sugar and leave on low heat for 45 minutes.*

## Notes

Informal notes, to-do lists, diary entries, etc often follow similar rules.

- *Gone to hairdresser. Back 12.30.*
- *Get tickets*
- *phone Anna*
- *see Josh 11.00*
- *meeting Emma lunch*

The same style is common in postcards, emails and text messages.

## Commentaries

Commentaries on fast-moving events like football matches also have their own kind of grammar. Auxiliaries and other less important verbs are often left out.

- *Goal kick … And the score still Spurs 1, Arsenal 3 … that’s Pearce … Pearce to Coates … good ball … Sawyer running wide … Billings takes it, through to Matthews, Matthews with a cross, oh, and Billings in beautifully, a good chance there – and it’s a goal!*

## Titles, notices, etc

Titles, labels, headings, notices and slogans usually consist of short phrases, not complete sentences. Articles are often left out, especially in the names of buildings and institutions.

- *``ROYAL HOTEL``*
- *``INFORMATION OFFICE``*
- *``MORE MONEY FOR NURSES!``*
