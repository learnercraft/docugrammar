# Correspondence: emails, text messages, etc

## Formal emails: style and layout

Formal emails are similar in style to letters on paper. The writerâ€™s postal address and phone numbers, if they are included, follow the signature.

## Personal messages

Personal messages sent by email, by (SMS) text messages and other social media (such as WhatsApp, Twitter, Tumblr, online chatrooms) are usually much more informal in style than letters on paper. Instead of *Dear X*, they might begin for example *X*, *Hi*, *Hi X*, *Hello X*, *Good morning X*, or with no salutation at all. Sentence structure may be reduced: for example *Canâ€™t come because work*. Afterthoughts that are added after the signature (or in following messages) are often introduced by *PS* (AmE *P.S.*), an abbreviation of Latin *post scriptum* (= â€˜written afterwardsâ€™). People who have forgotten to include an attachment often send it in a follow-up message beginning â€˜Oops!â€™.

## Addresses

email addresses are read as follows:

- j.harris@funbiz.co.uk : â€˜j dot harris at funbiz dot co dot u kâ€™
- emily@log-farm.com : â€˜emily at log dash farm dot comâ€™
- the\_rabbit@coolmail.gr : â€˜the underscore rabbit at coolmail dot g râ€™

Note also the names of symbols in â€˜urlsâ€™ (internet addresses):

- ``/``: forward slash
- ``\``: backslash
- ``:``: colon
