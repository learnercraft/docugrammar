# Punctuation: full stop, question mark and exclamation mark

## Sentence division

**Full stops** (AmE **periods**), **question marks** and **exclamation marks** (AmE **exclamation points**) are used to close sentences. After one of these, a new sentence has a capital letter.

- *I looked out of the window. It was snowing again.*
- *Why do we try to reach the stars? What is it all for?*
- *We need more houses! Not one day, not next year – now!*

We do not normally use full stops, question or exclamation marks to close grammatically incomplete sentences.

- *She phoned me as soon as she arrived.* (not *~~She phoned me. As soon as she arrived.~~*)
- *In his job he has to deal with different kinds of people.* (not *~~In his job. He has to deal with different kinds of people.~~*)
- *Did you understand why I was upset?* (not *~~Did you understand? Why I was upset?~~*)

However, sometimes we can emphasise a clause or phrase by separating it with a full stop and capital letter.

- *People are sleeping out on the streets. In Britain. In the 21st century. Because there are not enough houses.*

## Abbreviations

Full stops can be used after many abbreviations [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-formation-and-spelling/abbreviations). But they are often dropped in modern British English.

- *Dr. Andrew C. Burke, M.A.* (or Dr Andrew C Burke, MA)

## Indirect questions

We do not use question marks after indirect questions [(see here)](./../noun-clauses-direct-and-indirect-speech/indirect-speech-questions-and-answers).

- *I asked her what time it was.* (not *~~… what time it was?~~*)
