# Meals

There are regional and social differences in the names for meals.

## British usage

### Midday: *dinner* or *lunch*

The midday meal is often called *dinner*, especially if it is the main meal of the day. People who are ‘higher’ in the social scale usually call it *lunch*. *Lunch* is also the normal term used by most people for a light midday snack or packed meal.

### Afternoon: *tea*

(*Afternoon*) *tea* (a light meal of tea with biscuits and cakes, taken at four or five o’clock in the afternoon) is now very unusual, though it is often served in hotels.

### Early evening: sometimes *(high) tea* or *supper*

Many people have a cooked meal around five or six o’clock. This is often called *tea* or *high tea*; some people call it *supper*.

### Later evening: *supper* or *dinner*

A meal later in the evening is often called *supper* (and some people use the same word for a bedtime snack). Some people use *dinner* for the evening meal if it is the main meal of the day. A more formal evening meal with guests, or in a restaurant, is usually called *dinner*.

## American usage

Americans generally use *lunch* for the midday meal and *dinner* or *supper* for the evening meal. Celebration meals at Christmas and Thanksgiving are called *Christmas/Thanksgiving dinner*, even if they are eaten at midday.
