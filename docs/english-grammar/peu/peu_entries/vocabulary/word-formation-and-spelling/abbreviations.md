# Abbreviations

## Punctuation

Most abbreviations are generally written without full stops in modern British English. Full stops (AmE *periods*) are normal in American English.

- *Mr* (AmE *Mr.*) = *Mister* (not usually written in full)
- *kg* (AmE *kg.*) = *kilogram*
- *Ltd* = *Limited* (*company*)

## Initial-letter abbreviations

Some abbreviations are made from the first letters of several words. This often happens with the names of organisations.

- *the BBC* = *the British Broadcasting Corporation*

These abbreviations are most often stressed on the last letter.

- *the BBC* /ðə ˌbiː biː ˈsiː/
- *the USA* /ðə ˌjuː es ˈeɪ/

 If one of these abbreviations has an article (*a/an* or *the*), the form and pronunciation of the article depend on the pronunciation of the first letter of the abbreviation. Compare:

- ***an** EU country*  
  ***a** US diplomat* /ə juː …/ (not *~~an US …~~*)

- ***a** BA degree*  
  ***an** MP* /ən em …/ (not *~~a MP~~*)

- ***the** USA* /ðə juː …/ (not / *~~ðiː juː …~~*/)  
  ***the** RSPCA* /ðiː ɑːr …/ (not /*~~ðə ɑːr …~~*/)

## Acronyms

Some initial-letter abbreviations are pronounced like words. These are often called **‘acronyms’**. Articles are usually dropped in acronyms.

- *UNESCO* /juːˈneskəʊ/ (not *~~the UNESCO~~*) = *the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation*

Note that not all initial-letter abbreviations are pronounced as words.

- *the CIA* /ˌsiː aɪ ˈeɪ/ (not *~~/ˈsɪə/~~*)
- *the IRA* /ˌaɪ ɑːr ˈeɪ/ (not *~~/ˈaɪrə/~~*)

## Plurals

An apostrophe (’) is sometimes used before the *s* in the plurals of abbreviations.

- *MP’s, CD’s* but more often *MPs, CDs.*

## Some common abbreviations

The following abbreviations are given in their common British form, without full stops. Some of them could also have full stops in British English, and most would have full stops in American English. This is a small selection of the very many abbreviations commonly used in English. For explanations of others, see a good dictionary.
