# according to

*According to X* means ‘in X’s opinion’, ‘if what X says is true’.

- ***According to Harry**, it’s a good film.*
- *The train gets in at 8.27, **according to the timetable**.*

We do not usually give our own opinions with *according to*. Compare:

- ***According to Anna**, her boyfriend is brilliant.* (= If what Anna says is true, …)
- ***In my opinion**, Anna’s boyfriend is an idiot.* (not *~~According to me, …~~*)
