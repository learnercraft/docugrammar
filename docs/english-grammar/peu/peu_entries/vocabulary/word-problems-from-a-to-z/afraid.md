# afraid

## *afraid* and *fear*

In an informal style, *be afraid* is more common than *fear*.

- *Don’t **be afraid**.* (not *~~Don’t fear~~*)
- ***Are** you **afraid** of the dark?*
- *She’**s afraid** that I might find out.*
- *I’**m** not **afraid** to say what I think.*

## *I’m afraid* = ‘I’m sorry’

*I’m afraid (that)* often means I’m sorry to tell you (that). It is used to introduce apologetic refusals and bad news.

- ***I’m afraid (that)** I can’t help you.*
- ***I’m afraid (that)** there’s been an accident.*

*I’m afraid so/not* are used as short answers.

- *‘Can you lend me a pound?’ ‘**I’m afraid not**.’*
- *‘It’s going to rain.’ ‘Yes, **I’m afraid so**.’*

## Not used before a noun

*Afraid* is one of the adjectives that are not usually used before a noun in ‘attributive position’ [(see here)](./../../grammar/adjectives/adjectives-normal-position). Compare:

- *Jack’s **afraid**.*
- *Jack’s a **frightened** man.* (not *~~… an afraid man.~~*)
