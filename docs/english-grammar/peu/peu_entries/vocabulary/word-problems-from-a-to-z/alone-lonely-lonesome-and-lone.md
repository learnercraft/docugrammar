# alone, lonely, lonesome and lone

*Alone* means ‘without others around’. *Lonely* (and informal AmE **lonesome**) means ‘alone and unhappy because of it’. Compare:

- *I like to be **alone** for short periods.*
- *But after a few days I start getting **lonely/lonesome**.*

*Alone* can be emphasised by *all*.

- *After her husband died, she was **all alone**.*

*Alone* is not used before a noun [(see here)](./../../grammar/adjectives/adjectives-normal-position#adjectives-used-only-after-verbs). *Lone* and *solitary* can be used instead; *lone* is rather literary.

- *The only green thing was a **lone/solitary pine tree**.*
