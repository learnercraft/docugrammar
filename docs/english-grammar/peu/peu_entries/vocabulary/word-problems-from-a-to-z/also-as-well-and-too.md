# also, as well and too

## Position

*Also*, *as well* and *too* have similar meanings, but they do not go in the same position in clauses. *Also* usually goes with the verb, in mid-position [(see here)](./../../grammar/adverbs-and-adverbials/mid-position-details); *as well* and *too* usually go at the end of a clause. *As well* is less common in American English.

- *She not only sings; she **also** plays the piano.*
- *She not only sings; she plays the piano **as well**.*
- *She doesn’t just sing, she plays the piano **too**.*

*As well* and *too* do not go at the beginning of a clause. *Also* can go at the beginning of a clause to give more importance to a new piece of information.

- *It’s a nice house, but it’s very small. **Also**, it needs a lot of repairs.*

## Reference

These words can refer to different parts of a clause, depending on the meaning. Consider the sentence *We work on Saturdays as well.* This can mean three different things:

1. (Other people work on Saturdays, and) we work on Saturdays as well.
2. (We do other things on Saturdays, and) we work on Saturdays as well.
3. (We work on other days, and) we work on Saturdays as well.  
   When we speak, we show the exact meaning by stressing the word or expression that *also* / *as well* / *too* refers to.

## Imperatives and short answers

*As well* and *too* are used in imperatives and short answers, but not usually *also*.

- *Give me some bread **as well**, please.* (More natural than *Also give me …*)
- *‘She’s nice.’ ‘Her sister is **as well**.’* (More natural than *Her sister is also.*)
- *‘I’ve got a headache.’ ‘I have **too**.’* (More natural than *I also have.*)

In very informal speech, we often use *Me too* as a short answer.

- *‘I’m going home.’ ‘**Me too**.’*

More formal equivalents are *So am I* [(see here)](./../../grammar/speech-and-spoken-exchanges/so-am-i-neither-do-they-etc) or *I am too* (but not *~~I also~~*).

## *too* in a formal style

In a formal or literary style, *too* can be placed directly after the subject.

- *I, **too**, have experienced despair.*
