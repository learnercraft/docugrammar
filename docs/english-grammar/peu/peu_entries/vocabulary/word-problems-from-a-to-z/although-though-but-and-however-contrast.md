# although, though, but and however: contrast

## *although* and *though*: conjunctions

Both these words can be used as conjunctions, with the same meaning. *Though* is less formal than *although*, and is more common in speech than writing. They introduce an idea (‘A’) with which the main clause (‘B’) is in contrast. When we say ‘(Al)though A, B’, there is something unexpected or surprising about ‘B’.

- ***(Al)though** (A) I don’t like him, (B) I agree that he’s a good manager.*
- *(B) I’d quite like to go out, **(al)though** (A) it is a bit late.*

## *but* and *however*

We can give the same meaning by putting *but* or *however* with the contrasting, ‘unexpected’ clause (‘B’).

- *(A) I don’t like him, **but** (B) I agree that he’s a good manager.*
- *(A) I don’t like him. **However**, (B) I agree that he’s a good manager.*
- *(A) It is a bit late, **but** (B) I’d quite like to go out.*
- *(A) It is a bit late; **however**, (B) I’d quite like to go out.*

## *but* and *however*: the difference

*But* is a conjunction: it joins two clauses, and comes at the beginning of the second. *However* is an adverb: it does not connect its sentence grammatically to the one before. This is why it comes after a full stop or a semi-colon in the above examples.

*However* can go in various positions. It is normally separated from its sentence by one or two commas, depending on its position.

- ***However**, the police did not believe him.*
- *The police, **however**, did not believe him.*
- *The police did not believe him, **however**.*

## *though* used as an adverb

We can use *though* as an adverb (often at the end of a sentence), to mean ‘however’.

- *‘Nice day.’ ‘Yes. Bit cold, **though**.’*
- *The strongest argument, **though**, is economic and not political.*
