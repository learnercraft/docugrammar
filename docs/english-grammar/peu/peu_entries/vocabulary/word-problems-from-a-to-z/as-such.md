# as such

*Not … as such* is used to say that something is not exactly what a word or expression suggests.

- *‘So you went on a tour to Japan?’ ‘Well, **not** a tour **as such** – I went on business. But I managed quite a lot of sightseeing.’*
- *I’m **not** a teacher **as such**, but I’ve taught English to some of my friends.*
