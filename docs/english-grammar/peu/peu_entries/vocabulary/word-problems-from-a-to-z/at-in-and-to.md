# at/in and to

## The difference

*At* and *in* are generally used for position (for the difference, [(see here)](./at-on-and-in-place); *to* is used for movement or direction. Compare:

- *He works **at** the market.*  
  *He gets **to** the market by bike.*
- *My father lives **in** Canada.*  
  *I go **to** Canada to see him whenever I can.*

## Expressions of purpose

If we mention the purpose of a movement before we mention the destination, we usually use *at*/*in* before the place. Compare:

- *Let’s go **to** Marcel’s for coffee.*  
  *Let’s go and have coffee **at** Marcel’s.* (not *~~Let’s go and have coffee to Marcel’s.~~*)
- *I went **to** Canada to see my father.*  
  *I went to see my father **in** Canada.* (not *~~I went to see my father to Canada.~~*)

## Targets

After some verbs, *at* is used with the ‘target’ of a perception or non-verbal communication. Common examples are *look*, *smile*, *wave*, *frown*.

- *Why are you **looking at** her like that?*
- *Because she **smiled at** me.*

*At* is also used after some verbs referring to attacks or aggressive behaviour. Common examples are *shoot*, *laugh*, *throw*, *shout* and *point*.

- *It’s a strange feeling to have somebody **shoot at** you.*
- *If you can’t **laugh at** yourself, who can you **laugh at**?*
- *Stop **throwing** stones **at** the cat, darling.*
- *You don’t need to **shout at** me.*
- *In my dream, everybody was **pointing at** me and laughing.*

*Throw to*, *shout to* and *point to* are used when there is no idea of attack.

- *Please do not **throw** food **to** the animals.*
- *Could you **shout to** Jake and tell him it’s breakfast time?*
- *‘The train’s late again,’ she said, **pointing to** the timetable.*

*Arrive* is generally followed by *at* or *in*; never by *to*.

- *We should **arrive at** Pat’s in time for lunch.* (not *~~… arrive to Pat’s …~~*)
- *When did you **arrive in** New Zealand?* (not *~~… to New Zealand?~~*)
