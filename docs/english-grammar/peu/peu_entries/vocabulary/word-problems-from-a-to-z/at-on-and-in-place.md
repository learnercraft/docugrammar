# at, on and in: place

## *at*

*At* is used to talk about position at a point.

- *It’s very hot **at** the centre of the earth.*
- *Turn right **at** the next corner.*

Sometimes we use *at* with a larger place, if we just think of this as a point: a stage on a journey or a meeting place, for example. Compare:

- *The plane stops for an hour **at/in Frankfurt**.* (a point on a journey)  
  *She lives **in Frankfurt**.* (somebody’s home) (not *~~She lives at Frankfurt.~~*)
- *Let’s meet **at the club**.* (a meeting point)  
  *It was warm and comfortable **in the club**.* (a place to spend time)

We very often use *at* before the name of a building, when we are thinking not of the building itself but of the activity that happens there.

- *I first heard her sing **at the Usher Hall** in Edinburgh.*
- *Eat **at the Steak House** – best food in town.*
- *Sorry I didn’t phone last night – I was **at the theatre**.*

*At* is particularly common with proper names used for buildings or organisations. Compare:

- *I first met your father **at/in Harrods**.*  
  *I first met your father **in a shop**.*
- *She works **at Legal and General Insurance**.*  
  *She works **in a big insurance company**.*

*At* is used to say where people study.

- *He’s **at the London School of Economics**.*

We use *at* with the name of a city to talk about the city’s university. Compare:

- *He’s a student **at Oxford**.*
- *He lives **in Cambridge**.*

*At* is also used before the names of group activities.

- ***at** a party*
- ***at** a lecture*
- ***at** a meeting*
- ***at** the match*
- ***at** a concert*

## *on*

*On* is used to talk about position on a line (for example a road or a river).

- *His house is **on the way** from Aberdeen to Dundee.*
- *Stratford is **on the river Avon**.*

But *in* is used for the position of things which form part of the line.

- *There’s a misprint **in line 6** on page 22.*
- *Who’s the good-looking boy **in the sixth row**?*

*On* is used for position on a surface.

- *Hurry up – supper’s **on the table**!*
- *That picture would look better **on the other wall**.*
- *There’s a big spider **on the ceiling**.*

*On* can mean ‘attached to’.

- *Why do you wear that ring **on** your first finger?*
- *There aren’t many apples **on** the tree this year.*

*On* is also used for position by a lake or sea.

- *Bowness is **on Lake Windermere**.*
- *Southend-**on-Sea***

## *in*

*In* is used for position inside large areas, and in three-dimensional space (when something is surrounded on all sides).

- *I don’t think he’s **in his office**.*
- *She grew up **in Swaziland**.*
- *Let’s go for a walk **in the woods**.*
- *I last saw her **in Times Square**.*
- *He lived **in the desert** for three years.*

## Public transport

We use *on* (and *off*) to talk about travel using public transport (buses, trains, planes and boats), as well as (motor)cycles and horses.

- *There’s no room **on the bus**; let’s get **off** again.*
- *He’s arriving **on the 3.15 train**.* (not *~~… in/with the 3.15 train.~~*)
- *We’re travelling **on flight 604**.*
- *It took five days to cross the Atlantic **on the Queen Elizabeth**.*
- *I’ll go down to the shop **on my bike**.*

But we use *in* and *out* *(of)* to talk about cars and small private planes and boats.

- *She came **in a taxi**.*
- *He fell into the river when he was getting **out of his canoe**.*

## *arrive*

We generally use *at* (not *to*) after *arrive*; *in* is used before very large places.

- *He **arrives at** the airport at 15.30.* (not *~~He arrives to the airport …~~*)
- *What time do we **arrive in** New York?*

## Addresses

We generally use *at* to talk about addresses.

- *Are you still **at the same address**?*
- *She lives **at 73 Albert Street**.*

We use *in* (AmE *on*) if we just give the name of the street.

- *She lives **in Albert Street**.*

We use *on* for the number of the floor.

- *She lives in a room **on the third floor**.*

*At* can be used with a possessive (especially in British English) to mean ‘at somebody’s house or shop’.

- *‘Where’s Megan?’ ‘She’s **at Naomi’s**.’*
- *I used to get my bread **at a small baker’s** in the next street.*
