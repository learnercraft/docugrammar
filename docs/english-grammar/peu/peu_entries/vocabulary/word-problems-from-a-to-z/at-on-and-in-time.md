## Clock times: *at*

- *I usually get up **at six o’clock**.*
- *I’ll meet you **at 4.15**.*
- *Phone me **at lunch time**.*

*At* is usually left out before *what time* in an informal style [(see here)](./at-on-and-in-time#expressions-with-no-preposition).

- ***What time** does your train leave?*

## Parts of the day: *in*

- *I work best **in the morning**.*
- *three o’clock **in the afternoon***
- *We usually go out **in the evening**.*

Note the difference between *in the night* (mostly used to mean ‘during one particular night’) and *at night* (= during any night). Compare:

- *I had to get up **in the night**.*
- *I often work **at night**.*

In an informal style, we sometimes use plurals (*days*, etc) with no preposition.

- *Would you rather work **days** or **nights**?*

We use *on* if we say which morning/afternoon, etc we are talking about, or if we describe the morning/afternoon, etc.

- *See you **on Monday morning**.*
- *We met **on a cold afternoon** in early spring.*

## Days: *on*

- *I’ll ring you **on Tuesday**.*
- *My birthday’s **on March 21st**.*
- *They’re having a party **on Christmas Day**.*

In an informal style we sometimes leave out *on*.

- *I’m seeing her **Sunday morning**.*

We use plurals (*Sundays*, *Mondays*, etc) to talk about repeated actions.

- *We usually go and see Granny **on Sundays**.*

## Public holidays and weekends: *at*

We use *at* to talk about the whole of the holidays at Christmas, New Year, Easter and Thanksgiving (AmE).

- *We’re having the roof repaired **at Easter**.*

But we use *on* to talk about one day of the holiday.

- *Come and see us **on Christmas Day**.*
- *What are you doing **on Easter Monday**?*

British people say *at the weekend*; Americans use *on*.

- *What did you do **at the weekend**?*

## Longer periods: *in*

- *It happened **in the week** after Christmas.*
- *I was born **in March**.*
- *Kent is beautiful **in spring**.*
- *Our house was built **in the 15th century**.*
- *He died **in 1616**.*

## Other uses of *in*

*In* can also be used to say how soon something will happen, and to say how long something takes to happen.

- *Ask me again **in three or four days**.*
- *I can run 200 metres **in about 30 seconds**.*

The expression *in …’s time* is used to say how soon something will happen, not how long something takes. Compare:

- *I’ll see you again **in a month’s time**.*
- *It’ll be ready **in three weeks’ time**.*
- *He wrote the book **in a month**.* (not *~~… in a month’s time.~~*)

In American English, *in* can be used in negative sentences, like *for*, to talk about periods up to the present.

- *I haven’t seen her **in years**.*

## Expressions with no preposition

*At*/*on*/*in* are not normally used in expressions of time before *next*, *last*, *this*, *that* (sometimes), *one*, *any* (in an informal style), *each*, *every*, *some*, *all*.

- *See you **next week**.*
- *Are you free **this morning**?*
- *I’m at home **every evening**.*
- *We stayed **all day**.*
- *Come **any time**.*
- *I didn’t feel very well **that week**.*
- *We met **one day** in late August.*

These prepositions are not normally used, either, before *yesterday*, *the day before yesterday*, *tomorrow* or *the day after tomorrow*.

- *What are you doing **the day after tomorrow**?*

And prepositions are usually dropped in questions beginning *What*/*Which* + expression of time, and in answers which only contain an expression of time.

- ***What day** is the meeting?*
- ***Which week** did you say you’re away?*
- *‘**What time** are you leaving?’ ‘**Eight o’clock**.’*

:::note

Note that *at* is usually pronounced /ət/, not /æt/ [(see here)](./../../grammar/speech-and-spoken-exchanges/pronunciation-weak-and-strong-forms).

For the difference between *in* and *during*, [(see here)](./during-and-in).
