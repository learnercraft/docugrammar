    - *Do you mind? I was **before** / **in front of you**!*
    - *Her name comes **before mine** in the alphabet.*
    - *We use ‘a’ **before a consonant** and ‘an’ **before a vowel**.*
2. to mean ‘in the presence of (somebody important)’

    - *I came up **before the magistrates** for dangerous driving last week.*
3. in the expressions *right before one’s eyes*, *before one’s very eyes*.
