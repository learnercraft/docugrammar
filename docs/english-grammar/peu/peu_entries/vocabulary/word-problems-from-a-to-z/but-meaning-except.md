# but meaning ‘except’

## Use

We use *but* to mean ‘except’ after *all*, *none*, *every*, *any*, *no* (and *everything*, *everybody*, *nothing*, *nobody*, *anywhere*, etc).

- *He eats **nothing but** hamburgers.*
- ***Everybody**’s here **but** George.*
- *I’ve finished **all** the jobs **but** one.*

Note the expressions **next but one**, **last but two**, etc (mainly BrE).

- *Jackie lives **next** door **but one**.* (= two houses from me)
- *I was **last but two** in the race yesterday.*

*But for* expresses the idea ‘if something had not existed/happened’.

- *I would have been in real trouble **but for** your help.*
- ***But for** the storm, I would have been home before eight.*

Note also the structure *who/what should … but* (used to talk about surprising appearances, meetings, etc).

- *I walked out of the station, and **who should** I see **but** old Holly?*
- *I looked under the bed, and **what should** I find **but** the keys I lost last week?*

## Pronouns after *but*

After *but*, we usually use object pronouns (*me*, *him*, etc). Subject pronouns (*I*, *he*, etc) are possible in a more formal style before a verb.

- *Nobody **but her** would do a thing like that.* (More formal: *Nobody but she …)

## Verbs after *but*

The verb form after *but* usually depends on what came before. Infinitives are normally without *to*.

- *She’s not interested in anything **but skiing**.* (*interested in … skiing*)
- *That child does nothing **but watch** TV.* (*does … watch*)

*Can’t (help) but* + infinitive without *to* is sometimes used with the meaning of ‘can’t help …ing’ [(see here)](./can-t-help). *Cannot but …* is very formal; **can’t help but …** is especially common in American English.

- *One **cannot (help) but admire** his courage.* (= One has to admire …)
- *I **can’t help but wonder** what’s going to happen to us all.*

Infinitives with *to* are used after *no alternative*/*choice*/*option but …*

- *The train was cancelled, so I had **no alternative but to take** a taxi.*

## *but* meaning ‘only’

In older English, *but* was used to mean ‘only’, but this is now very unusual.

- *She is **but** a child.*

:::note

Note: *but* is usually pronounced /bət/, not /bʌt/ [(see here)](./../../grammar/speech-and-spoken-exchanges/pronunciation-weak-and-strong-forms).

For *except*, [(see here)](./except-and-except-for).

For *but* as a conjunction and ellipsis after *but*, [(see here)](./../../grammar/information-structure/ellipsis-with-and-but-and-or).
