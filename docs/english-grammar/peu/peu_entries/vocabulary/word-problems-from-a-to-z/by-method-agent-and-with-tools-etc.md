# by (method, agent) and with (tools, etc)

## The difference

*By* and *with* can both be used to say how somebody does something, but there is an important difference.

We use *by* to talk about an action – what we **do** to get a result. We use *with* to talk about a tool or other object – what we **use** to get a result. Compare:

- *I killed the spider **by hitting it**.* (Note the *\-ing* form after *by*.)  
  *I killed the spider **with a shoe**.* (not *~~… by a shoe.~~*)
- *‘I got where I am **by hard work**.’*  
  *‘No you didn’t. You got there **with your wife’s money**.’*

*Without* is the opposite of both *by* and *with* in these cases. Compare:

- *I got her to listen **by** shouting.*  
  *It’s difficult to get her to listen **without** shouting.*
- *We’ll have to get it out **with** a screwdriver.*  
  *We can’t get it out **without** a screwdriver.*

*By* is also used to refer to means of transport (*by bus*, *by train*, etc), [(see here)](./../../grammar/determiners-a-an-and-the-my-your-etc-this-that-etc/special-rules-and-exceptions#common-expressions-without-articles-in-bed-at-school).

## Passive clauses

In passive clauses, *by* introduces the agent – the person or thing that is responsible for the action [(see here)](./../../grammar/passives/by-agent).

- *I was interviewed **by three directors**.*
- *My car was damaged **by a falling branch**.*

We generally prefer *with* to refer to a tool or instrument used by somebody. Compare:

- *He was killed **by a heavy stone**.* (This could mean ‘A stone fell and killed him’.)
- *He was killed **with a heavy stone**.* (This means ‘Somebody used a stone to kill him’.)
