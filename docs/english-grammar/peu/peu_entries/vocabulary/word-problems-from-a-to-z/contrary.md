# contrary

## *on the contrary* and *on the other hand*

*On the contrary* is used to contradict – to say that what has been said or suggested is not true. If we want to give the other side of a question, we use *on the other hand*, not *on the contrary*. Compare:

- *‘I suppose the job was boring?’ ‘**On the contrary**, it was really exciting.’*  
  *The job was boring, but **on the other hand** it was well paid.* (not *~~… on the contrary, it was well paid.~~*)
- *He did not make things easy for his parents. **On the contrary**, he did everything he could to annoy and worry them.*  
  *He did not make things easy for his parents. **On the other hand**, he could often be wonderfully sweet and loving.*

We can emphasise a contrast with *in contrast*.

- *Daytime temperatures in the desert are very high. **In contrast**, the nights can be bitterly cold.* (not *~~On the contrary, the night …~~*)

## *contrary* and *opposite*

We use *opposite* [(see here)](./opposite-adjective-position), not *contrary*, to talk about contrasting words.

- *‘Short’ is the **opposite** of ‘tall’, and also of ‘long’.* (not *~~… the contrary of ‘tall’ …~~*)
