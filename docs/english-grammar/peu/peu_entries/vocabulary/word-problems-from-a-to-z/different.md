# different

## Modifiers: *any different*, etc

*Different* is a little like a comparative: unlike most adjectives, it can be modified by *any* and *no*, *(a) little* and *not much*.

- *I hadn’t seen her for years, but she wasn’t **any** different.*
- *‘How’s the patient, doctor?’ ‘**No** different.’*
- *His ideas are **little** different from those of his friends.*
- *The new school isn’t **much** different from the old one.*

*Quite different* means ‘completely different’ [(see here)](./quite#comparisons).

- *I thought you’d be like your sister, but you’re **quite different.***

Unlike comparatives, *different* can also be modified by *very.*

- *She’s **very** different from her sister.*

## Prepositions: *different from/to*

*From* is generally used after *different*; many British people also use *to*. In American English, **than** is common.

- *American football is very different **from/to** soccer.* (AmE **… different **from**/**than** soccer.**)

Before a clause, *different than* is also possible in British English.

- **The job’s different **than I expected.**** (or … different **from**/**to what** I expected.)

For the difference between *different* and *other*, [(see here)](./other-s-and-another#not-used-like-an-adjective).
