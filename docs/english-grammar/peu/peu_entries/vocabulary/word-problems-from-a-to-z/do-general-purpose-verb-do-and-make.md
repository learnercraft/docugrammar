# do: general-purpose verb; do and make

The general-purpose verb *do* has several uses, and can sometimes be confused with *make*.

- *Learn more about what we **do** and what we **make** at megamega.com.* (advertisement)

## *do* for indefinite activities

We use *do* when we do not say exactly what activity we are talking about – for example with words like *thing*, *something*, *nothing*, *anything*, *what*.

- *Then he **did** a very strange **thing**.* (not *~~Then he made a very strange thing.~~*)
- ***Do something**!*
- *I like **doing nothing**.* (not *~~… making nothing.~~*)
- ***What** shall we **do**?*

## *do* for work

We use *do* when we talk about work and jobs.

- *I’m not going to **do** any work today.*
- *It’s time to **do** the accounts.*
- *Could you **do** the shopping for me?*
- *I wouldn’t like to **do** your job.*
- *I **did** (= studied) French and German at school.*
- *Has Ben **done** his homework?*
- *Could you **do** the ironing first, and then **do** the windows if you’ve got time?*

## *do …ing*

We use *do* in the informal structure *do …ing* to talk about activities that take a certain time, or are repeated (for example jobs and hobbies). There is usually a determiner (e.g. *the*, *my*, *some*, *much*) before the *\-ing* form.

- *During the summer I’m going to **do some walking** and **a lot of reading**.*
- *I hate **doing the ironing**.*

 Note that the *\-ing* form in this structure is noun-like, and cannot have an object.

- (not *~~I’m going to do some watching TV.~~*)

But *do* can be used with a compound noun that includes verb + object.

- *I want to **do some bird-watching** this weekend.*
- *It’s time I **did some letter-writing**.*

## *make* for constructing, creating, etc

We often use *make* to talk about constructing, building, creating, etc.

- *I’ve just **made** a cake.*
- *Let’s **make** a plan.*
- *My father and I once **made** a boat.*

## *do* instead of *make*

We sometimes use *do* in place of *make*, to sound casual about a creative activity – as if we are not claiming to produce any very special results.

- *‘What are we going to eat?’ ‘Well, I could **do** an omelette.’*

## Common fixed expressions

***do** good*, *harm*, *business*, *one’s best*, *somebody a favour*, *sport*, *some exercise*, *one’s hair*, *one’s teeth*, *one’s duty*, *50mph*

***make** a journey*, *an offer*, *arrangements*, *a suggestion*, *a decision*, *an attempt*, *an effort*, *an excuse*, *an exception*, *a mistake*, *a noise*, *a phone call*, *money*, *a profit*, *a fortune*, *love*, *peace*, *war*, *a bed*, *progress*

Note that we say ***make** a bed*, but we often talk about ***doing** the bed(s)* as part of the housework. Compare:

- *He’s old enough to **make his own bed** now.*
- *I’ll start on the vegetables as soon as I’ve **done the beds**.*

We use *take*, not *make*, in *take a photo*, and *have*, not *make*, in *have an (interesting) experience*.
