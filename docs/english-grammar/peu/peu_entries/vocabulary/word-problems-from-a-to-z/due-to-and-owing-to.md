# due to and owing to

*Due to* and *owing to* are similar to ‘because of’. *Due to* is more common than *owing to*.

Phrases beginning *due/owing to* are often separated from the rest of their sentence by a comma.

- ***Due/Owing to** the bad weather(,) the match was cancelled.*
- *We have had to postpone the meeting(,) **due/owing to** the strike.*

Some people believe it is incorrect to use *due to* at the beginning of a clause in this way, but the structure is common in educated usage.

*Due to* can also follow the verb *be*. *Owing to* is not usually used like this.

- *His success was **due to** his mother.* (not *~~… was owing to his mother.~~*)
