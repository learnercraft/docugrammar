# during and for

*During* is used to say **when** something happens; *for* is used to say **how long** it lasts. Compare:

- *My father was in Germany **during the summer**.*  
  *My father was in Germany **for six weeks**.* (not *~~… during six weeks.~~*)
- *It rained **during the night for two or three hours**.*  
  *I’ll come and see you **for a few minutes during the afternoon**.*

:::note

For *for*, *since*, *in* and *from*, [(see here)](./for-since-in-and-from-time).
