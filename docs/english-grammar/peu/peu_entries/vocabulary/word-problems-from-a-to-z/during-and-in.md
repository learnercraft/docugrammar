# during and in

We use both *during* and *in* to say that something happens inside a particular period of time.

- *We’ll be away **during/in** August.*
- *I woke up **during/in** the night.*

We use *during* to stress that we are talking about the whole of the period.

- *The shop’s closed **during all** of August.* (not *~~… in all of August.~~*)

And we use *during* when we are talking about an event, activity or experience (not simply a period of time).

- *He had some strange experiences **during his military service**.* (not *~~… in his military service.~~*)
- *I’ll try to phone you **during the meeting**.* (not *~~… in the meeting.~~*)
- *I met them **during my stay in China**.*
