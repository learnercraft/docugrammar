# efficient and effective

If somebody/something is *efficient*, he/she/it works in a well-organised way without wasting time or energy.

- *He’s not very **efficient**: he works very slowly, and he keeps forgetting things.*
- *Our bus service is even less **efficient** than our train service.*

If something is *effective*, it has the right effect: it solves a problem or gets a result.

- *My headache’s much better. Those tablets really are **effective**.*
- *I think a wide black belt would look very **effective** with that dress.*
