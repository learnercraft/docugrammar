# elder and eldest

**Elder** and **eldest** can be used instead of *older* and *oldest* to talk about the order of birth of the members of a family. They are only used attributively (before nouns). Compare:

- *My **elder**/older brother has just got married.*  
  *He’s three years **older** than me.* (not *~~… elder than me.~~*)
- *His **eldest**/oldest daughter is a medical student.*  
  *She’s the **oldest** student in her year.*

*Elder brother/sister* are used when a person has only one brother/sister who is older; *eldest* is used when there are more. An *elder son/daughter* is the older of two; an *eldest son/daughter* is the oldest of two or more.
