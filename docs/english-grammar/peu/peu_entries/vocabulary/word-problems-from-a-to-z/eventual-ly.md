# eventual(ly)

*Eventual* and *eventually* mean ‘final(ly)’, ‘in the end’, ‘after all that’. We use them to say that something happens after a long time or a lot of effort.

- *The chess game lasted for three days. Androv was the **eventual** winner.*
- *The car didn’t want to start, but **eventually** I got it going.*

*Eventual* and *eventually* are ‘false friends’ for people who speak some languages. They do not mean the same as, for instance, French *éventuel*/*éventuellement*, Dutch *eventueel* or Polish *ewentualny*/*ewentualnie*, and are not used to express the idea of possibility. For this meaning we use *possible*, *perhaps*, *if*, *may*, *might*, etc.

- *In our new house I’d like to have a spare bedroom for **possible** visitors.* (not *~~… eventual visitors.~~*)
- *I’m not sure what I’ll do next year. I could look for a job here, or I **might** go to America.* (not *~~Eventually I’ll go to America …~~*)
