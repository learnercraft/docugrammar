# ever

## *ever* meaning ‘at any time’

*Ever* is a ‘non-affirmative word’ [(see here)](./../../grammar/basic-clause-types/non-affirmative-words-anybody-ever-yet-etc). It is used especially in questions to mean ‘at any time’. Compare:

- *Do you **ever** go to London by train?* (= at any time)
- *I **always** go to London by train.* (= every time)
- *I **sometimes** go to Birmingham by train.*
- *I **never** go to Cambridge by train.* (= at no time)

*Ever* is possible in negative clauses, but *never* is more usual than *not ever*.

- *I do**n’t ever** want to see you again.* (or I **never** want …)

We also use *ever* after *if*, and with words that express a negative idea (like *nobody*, *hardly* or *stop*).

- *Come and see us **if** you are **ever** in Manchester.*
- ***Nobody ever** visits them.*
- *I **hardly ever** see my sister.*
- *I’m going to **stop** her **ever** doing that again.*

## With comparatives, superlatives, *as* and *only*

*Ever* is used in affirmative clauses in comparisons and with *only*.

- *You’re looking **lovelier than** ever.*
- *What is the **best** book you’ve **ever** read?*
- *It’s the **largest** picture **ever** painted.*
- *He’s as charming **as ever**.*
- *She’s the **only** woman **ever** to have climbed this mountain in winter.*

## *ever* + perfect

*Ever* is often used with perfect tenses ( [(see here)](./../../grammar/past-and-perfect-tenses/present-perfect-basic-information), [(see here)](./../../grammar/past-and-perfect-tenses/past-perfect-basic-information) to mean ‘at any time up to now/then’.

- ***Have** you **ever been** to Greece?*
- ***Had** you **ever thought** of getting married before you met Georgia?*

## *ever* and *before*; *ever before*

*Ever* and *before* can both be used to mean ‘at any time in the past’, but there is a difference. *Before* (or *ever before*) refers to a present event, and asks whether it has happened at another time.

- *Have you (ever) been to Scotland **before**?* (The hearer is probably in Scotland.)

*Ever* (without *before*) does not refer to a present event.

- *Have you **ever** been to Africa?* (The hearer is not in Africa.)

## *ever* meaning ‘always’

*Ever* is not normally used to mean ‘always’.

- *I shall **always** remember you.* (not *~~I shall ever remember you.~~*)

But *ever* is sometimes used to mean ‘always’ in compound expressions with adjectives and participles.

- *his **ever-open** mouth*
- ***evergreen** trees*
- *an **ever-increasing** debt*
- *his **ever-loving** wife*

*Ever* also means ‘always’ in *forever* (or *for ever*) and *ever since*, and in a few other expressions like *ever after* and *Yours ever* (used at the end of letters).

- *I shall love you **forever**.*
- *I’ve admired him **ever since** I met him.*
