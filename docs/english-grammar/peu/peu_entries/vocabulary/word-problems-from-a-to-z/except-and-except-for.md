# except and except for

## *except for* before nouns

We generally use *except for* before noun phrases.

- *I’ve cleaned the house **except for** the bathroom.*
- *The garden was empty **except for** one small bird.*

## *except (for)* after *all*, *any*, etc

After generalising words like *all*, *any*, *every*, *no*, *everything*, *anybody*, *nowhere*, *nobody*, *whole*, we often leave out *for*.

- *I’ve cleaned **all** the rooms **except (for)** the bathroom.*
- *He ate **everything** on his plate **except (for)** the beans.*
- ***Nobody** came **except (for)** Jack and Emily.*

But this does not happen **before** *all*, *any*, *nobody*, etc.

- ***Except for** the bathroom, **all** the rooms are clean.* (not *~~Except the bathroom, all the rooms are clean.~~*)

## *except* before prepositions and conjunctions

We use *except*, not *except for*, before prepositions and conjunctions.

- *It’s the same everywhere **except in** Scotland.* (not *~~… except for in Scotland.~~*)
- *He’s good-looking **except when** he smiles.*
- *This room is no use **except as** a storeroom.*
- *The trip was nice **except that** there wasn’t enough snow.*

## *except (for)* + pronoun

After *except (for)* we use object pronouns, not subject pronouns.

- *Everybody understood **except (for) me**.* (not *~~… except I.~~*)
- *We’re all ready **except (for) her**.*

## *except* + verb: *He does nothing except eat.*

A common structure is *do* … *except* + infinitive without *to*.

- *He **does** nothing **except eat** all day.*
- *I’ll **do** everything for you **except cook**.*

In other cases an *\-ing* form is usually necessary.

- *She’s not interested in anything **except skiing**.*
- *You needn’t worry about anything **except having** a great time.*

## *except* and *without*

*Except (for)* is only used to talk about exceptions to generalisations. In other cases, *without* or *but for* may be better. Compare:

- *Nobody helped me **except** you.*
- ***Without** / **But for** your help, I would have failed.* (not *~~Except for your help, I would have failed.~~*)

:::note

For the use of *but* to mean ‘except’, [(see here)](./but-meaning-except).
