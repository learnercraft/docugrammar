# fairly, quite, rather and pretty: adverbs of degree

These four modifiers differ somewhat in strength, though their exact force depends on the context. This entry gives a brief explanation of their use with gradable descriptive words [(see here)](./../../grammar/adjectives/gradable-and-non-gradable-adjectives) in British English. Note also that *quite* and *rather* (in the senses discussed here) are more common in British than American English, as is *fairly*. For more information about *quite* and *rather*, [(see here)](./quite).

## *fairly*

*Fairly* generally modifies adjectives and adverbs. It does not suggest a very high degree: if you say that somebody is *fairly nice* or *fairly clever*, for example, he or she will not be very pleased.

- *‘How was the film?’ ‘**Fairly** good. Not the best one I’ve seen this year.’*
- *I speak Russian **fairly** well – enough for everyday purposes.*

## *quite*

****Quite**** (especially in British English) can suggest a higher degree than *fairly*.

- *‘How was the film?’ ‘**Quite** good. You ought to go.’*
- *It’s **quite** a difficult book – I had trouble with it.*
- *He’s lived in St Petersburg, so he speaks Russian **quite** well.*

*Quite* can also modify verbs and nouns.

- *I **quite enjoyed** myself at your party.*
- *The room was **quite a mess**.*

## *rather*

*Rather* is stronger than *quite*. It can suggest ‘more than is usual’, ‘more than was expected’, ‘more than was wanted’, and similar ideas.

- *‘How was the film?’ ‘**Rather** good – I was surprised.’*
- *Maurice speaks Russian **rather** well. People often think he is Russian.*
- *I think I’ll put the heating on. It’s **rather** cold.*
- *I’ve had **rather** a long day.*

*Rather* can modify verbs (especially verbs that refer to thoughts and feelings) and nouns.

- *I **rather think** we’re going to lose.*
- *She **rather likes** gardening.*
- *It was **rather a disappointment**.*

## *pretty*

*Pretty* (informal) is like *rather*, but only modifies adjectives and adverbs.

- *‘How’s things?’ ‘**Pretty** good. You OK?’*
- *You’re driving **pretty** fast.*

*Pretty well* means ‘almost’.

- *I’ve **pretty well** finished.*
