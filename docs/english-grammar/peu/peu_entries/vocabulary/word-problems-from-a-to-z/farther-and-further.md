# farther and further

## Distance

We can use both *farther* and *further* to talk about distance. They mean the same. *Further* is not generally used in this sense in American English, and is becoming much less common in British English.

- *Edinburgh is **farther**/**further** away than York.*

## ‘additional’

*Further* (but not *farther*) can mean ‘additional’, ‘extra’, ‘more advanced’.

- *For **further** information, see page 6.*
- *College of **Further** Education*
