# fit and suit

These words do not mean exactly the same.

*Fit* refers to size and shape: if your clothes *fit* you, they are neither too big nor too small.

- *These shoes don’t **fit** me – have you got a larger size?*

*Suit* refers to style, colour, etc.

- *Red and black are colours that **suit** me very well.* (not *~~… colours that fit me very well.~~*)
- *Do you think this style **suits** me?*

*Suit* can also be used to say whether arrangements are convenient.

- *Tuesday would **suit** me very well for a meeting.*
