# for: purpose and cause

## People’s purposes: *I went for an interview*

*For* can be used to talk about somebody’s purpose in doing something, but only when it is followed by a noun.

- *We stopped at the pub **for a drink**.*
- *I went to the college **for an interview** with Professor Taylor.*

*For* is not used before a verb in this sense. The infinitive alone is used to express a person’s purpose [(see here)](./../../grammar/infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-other-uses/infinitive-of-purpose-i-sat-down-to-rest).

- *We stopped at the pub **to have** a drink.* (not *~~… for having a drink~~*) or *~~for to have a drink~~*
- *I went to the college **to see** Professor Taylor.* (not *~~… for seeing Professor Taylor.~~*)

## The purposes of things: *-ing* forms and infinitives

*For* can be used before the *\-ing* form of a verb to express the ‘purpose’ of a thing – what it is used for – especially when the thing is the subject.

- *Is that cake **for eating** or just **for looking at**?*
- *An altimeter is used **for measuring** height above sea level.*

When the clause has a person as subject, an infinitive is often used to express the purpose of a thing.

- *We use altimeters **to measure** height above sea level.*

## Causes of reactions

*For …ing* can also be used after a description of a positive or negative reaction, to explain the behaviour that caused it.

- *We are grateful to you **for helping** us out.*
- *I’m angry with you **for waking** me up.*
- *They punished the child **for lying**.*
- *He was sent to prison **for stealing**.*
