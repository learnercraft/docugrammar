# go/come for a …

We can use the structure *go/come for a …* in some fixed expressions referring to actions, mostly leisure activities. Using this structure makes the action sound casual and probably rather short. (Compare *go …ing*, [(see here)](./go-come-ing).) Common examples:

- *go/come for a walk, a run, a swim, a ride, a drive, a drink, a meal*
- *go for a bath, a shower, a pee/piss* (taboo, [(see here)](./../vocabulary-areas/discriminatory-and-offensive-language-taboo-words-and-swear-words)
- *We need some fresh air. Let’s **go for a walk**.*
- *Would you like to **come for a drink** this evening?*
- *I’m **going for a shower**. Can you answer my phone if it rings?*

This structure is only used with certain action-nouns – we would probably not say, for example, *Come for a climb with us* or *I’m going for a read*.
