# happen to …

*Happen* can be used with a following infinitive to suggest that something happens unexpectedly or by chance.

- *If you **happen to see** Imogen, ask her to phone me.*
- *One day I **happened to get** talking to a woman on a train, and she turned out to be a cousin of my mother’s.*

In sentences with *if* or *in case*, the idea of *by chance* can be emphasised in British English by using *should* before *happen*, but this is no longer very common.

- *Let me know if you **should happen** to need any help.*
- *I’ll take my swimming things, in case I **should happen** to find a pool open.*
