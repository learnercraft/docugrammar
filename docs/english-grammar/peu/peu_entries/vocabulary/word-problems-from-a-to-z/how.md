# how

## Use and word order

*How* is used to introduce questions or the answers to questions.

- ***How** did you do it?*
- *Tell me **how** you did it.*
- *I know **how** he did it.*

We also use *how* in exclamations [(see here)](./../../grammar/basic-clause-types/exclamations). The word order is not the same as in questions. Compare:

- *How cold **is it**?*  
  *How cold **it is**!*
- *How **do you like** my hair?*  
  *How **I love** weekends!* (not *~~How do I love weekends!~~*)
- *How **have you** been?*  
  *How **you’ve** grown!* (not *~~How have you grown!~~*)

When *how* is used in an exclamation with an adjective or adverb, this comes immediately after *how*.

- ***How beautiful** the trees are!* (not *~~How the trees are beautiful!~~*)
- ***How well** she plays!* (not *~~How she plays well!~~*)

## With adjectives/adverbs: *how*, not *how much*

We use *how*, not *how much*, before adjectives and adverbs.

- ***How tall** are you?* (not *~~How much tall are you?~~*)
- *Show me **how fast** you can run.* (not *~~… how much fast …~~*)

## Comparisons: *how* not used

In comparisons we use *as* or *like* [(see here)](./like-and-as-similarity-function) or *the way* (see below), not *how*.

- *Hold it in both hands, **as** / **like** / **the way** Mummy does.* (not *~~… how Mummy does.~~*)

## *how*, *what* and *why*

These three question words can sometimes be confused. Note particularly the following common structures.

- ***How** do you know?* (not *~~Why do you know?~~*)
- ***What** do you call this?* (not *~~How do you call this?~~*)
- ***What’s** that called?* (not *~~How is that called?~~*)
- ***What** do you think?* (not *~~How do you think?~~*)
- ***What?** **What** did you say?* (not *~~How? How did you say?~~*)
- ***Why** should I think that?*

Both *What about …?* and *How about …?* are used to make suggestions, and to bring up points that have been forgotten.

- ***What**/**How about** eating out this evening?*
- ***What**/**How about** the kids? Who’s going to look after them?*

In exclamations [(see here)](./../../grammar/basic-clause-types/exclamations), *what* is used before noun phrases; and *how* is used before adjectives (without nouns), adverbs and verb phrases.

- ***What** a wonderful house!*
- ***How** wonderful!*
- ***How** you’ve changed!*

## *how much*, *how many*, *how old*, *how far*, etc

Many interrogative expressions of two or more words begin with *how*. These are used to ask for measurements, quantities, etc. Examples:

- ***How much** do you weigh?*
- ***How old** are your parents?*
- ***How many** people were there?*
- ***How far** is your house?*
- ***How often** do you come to New York?*

Note that English does not have a special expression to ask for ordinal numbers (*first*, *second*, etc).

- *‘It’s our wedding anniversary.’ ‘Congratulations. Which one?’* (not *~~… the how-manyeth?~~*)

## *the way*

*The way* [(see here)](./way) can often be used instead of non-interrogative *how*. Note that *the way* and *how* are not used together.

- *Look at **the way** those cats wash each other. or Look at **how** those cats …* (not *~~… the way how those cats wash …~~*)
- ***The way** you organise the work is for you to decide. or **How** you organise …* (not *~~The way how you organise …~~*)
