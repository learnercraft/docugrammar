# ill and sick

*Ill* and *sick* are both used to mean ‘unwell’. (In American English *ill* is less usual except in a formal style.)

- *George didn’t come in last week because he was **ill/sick**.*

*Ill* is not very common before a noun.

- *I’m looking after my **sick** mother.* (More normal than … *my ill mother*.)

*Be sick* can meant ‘vomit’ (= bring food up from the stomach) in British English.

- *I **was sick** three times in the night.*
