# immediately, the moment, etc: conjunctions

In British English, *immediately* and *directly* can be used as conjunctions, to mean ‘as soon as’.

- *Tell me **immediately** you have any news.*
- *I knew something was wrong **immediately** I arrived.*
- ***Directly** I walked in the door, I smelt smoke.*

*The moment (that)*, *the instant (that)*, *the second (that)* and *the minute (that)* can be used in the same way (in both British and American English).

- *Telephone me **the moment (that)** you get the results.*
- *I loved you **the instant (that)** I saw you.*

As with other time conjunctions, we use present tenses when talking about the future.

- *I’ll let you know the moment I **have** some definite information.*
