# instead and instead of

## Preposition: *instead of*

*Instead* is not used alone as a preposition; we use the two words *instead of*.

- *I’ll have tea **instead of** coffee, please.* (not *~~… instead coffee …~~*)
- *Can you work with Sophie **instead of** me today, please?*

*Instead of* is not usually followed by an infinitive.

- *I stayed in bed all day **instead of going** to work.* (not *~~… instead of (to) go to work.~~*)

## *instead of* and *without*

*Instead of* suggests that one person, thing or action replaces another. *Without* suggests that one person, thing, etc is not together with another. Compare:

- *Ruth was invited to the reception, but she was ill, so Lou went **instead of** her.* (Lou replaced Ruth.) (not *~~… Lou went without her.~~*)  
  *Max and Jake were invited, but Max was ill, so Jake went **without** him.* (Normally they would have gone together.)
- *She often goes swimming **instead of** going to school.* (Swimming replaces school.) (not *~~She often goes swimming without going to school.~~*)  
  *She often goes swimming **without** telling her mother.* (Swimming and telling her mother should go together.) (not *~~She often goes swimming instead of telling her mother.~~*)

## Adverb: *instead*

*Instead* (without *of*) is an adverb. It usually begins or ends a clause.

- *She didn’t go to Greece after all. **Instead**, she went to America.*
- *Don’t marry Jake. Marry me **instead**.*

We do not use *instead* to mark a contrast, in the sense of ‘on the other hand’.

- *He’s a rather anti-social person. **On the other hand**, he’s very generous.* (not *~~Instead, he’s very generous.~~*)
