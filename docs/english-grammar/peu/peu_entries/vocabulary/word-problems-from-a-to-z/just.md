# just

## Meanings

*Just* has several meanings.

## Time

*Just* often emphasises the idea of ‘at this moment’ or ‘close to the present’.

- *I’ll be down in a minute – I’m **just** changing my shirt.* (= right now)
- *Alice has **just** phoned.* (= a short time ago)
- *Sam’s still around. I saw him **just** last week.* (= as recently as)

In expressions like *just after*, *just before* and *just when*, *just* suggests closeness to the time in question.

- *I saw him **just after** lunch.* (= … very soon after lunch.)

## ‘only’, ‘scarcely’

*Just* can mean ‘only’, ‘nothing more than’, ‘scarcely’.

- *Complete set of garden tools for **just** £15.99!*
- *I **just** want somebody to love me – that’s all.*
- *We **just** caught the train.*

This meaning can be emphasised by *only*.

- *There was **only just** enough light to read by.*

*Can/Could I just …*? can make a request seem less demanding.

- ***Could I just** use your phone for a moment?*

## ‘exactly’

*Just* often means ‘exactly’.

- *‘What’s the time?’ ‘It’s **just** four o’clock.’*
- *Thanks. That’s **just** what I wanted.*
- *She’s **just** as bad-tempered as her father.*

## Emphasiser

*Just* can emphasise other words and expressions, with the sense of ‘simply’, ‘there’s no other word for it’.

- *You’re **just** beautiful.*
- *I **just** love your dress.*

## Tenses

When *just* means ‘a moment ago’, past and present perfect tenses are both possible in British English. A present perfect is preferred when we are giving news. Compare:

- *I’**ve** **just** **had** a brilliant idea.*
- *Jack(’**s**) **just called**. His wife’**s** **had** a baby.* (The news is the baby, not the phone call.)

In American English a past tense is also very common.

- *‘Where’s Sam?’ ‘He **just went out**.’*
- *Alice **(has) just left**.*
- *I **just had** a brilliant idea.*

## *just now*

*Just now* can mean either ‘at this moment’ or ‘a few moments ago’. Compare:

- *She’s not in **just now**. Can I take a message?*
- *I saw Jake **just now**. He wanted to talk to you.*

When *just now* means ‘a few moments ago’, two positions are possible:

1. in end-position, usually with a past tense.

    - *I telephoned Anna **just now.***
2. in mid-position [(see here)](./../../grammar/adverbs-and-adverbials/mid-position-details) with the verb, with a present perfect or past tense.

    - *I(’ve) **just now** realised what I need to do.*
