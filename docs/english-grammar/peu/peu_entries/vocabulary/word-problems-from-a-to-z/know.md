# know

## *know how* + infinitive

*Know* is not followed directly by infinitives. We use know *how to* [(see here)](./../../grammar/infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-other-uses/infinitives-after-question-words-who-to-etc).

- *I **know how to make** Spanish omelettes.* (not *~~I know to make …~~*)

## Object + infinitive

In a formal style, *know* is sometimes followed by object + infinitive.

- *They **knew him to be** a dangerous criminal.*

The passive equivalent is quite common in a formal style.

- *He **was known to be** a dangerous criminal.*

In a less formal style, *that*\-clauses are more usual.

- *They **knew that** he was a dangerous criminal.*

*Know* means ‘experience’ in the common structure *I’ve never known* + object + infinitive; an infinitive without *to* is possible in British English.

- *I’ve never **known it (to) rain** like this.*

## Tenses

*Know* cannot usually be used in progressive forms [(see here)](./../../grammar/verbs/non-progressive-verbs).

- *I **know** exactly what you mean.* (not *~~I am knowing …~~*)

A present perfect tense is used to say how long one has known somebody or something. [(see here)](./../../grammar/past-and-perfect-tenses/present-perfect-or-present) for more details.)

- *We’**ve known** each other since 1994.* (not *~~We know each other since 1994.~~*)

## *know* and *know about*/*of*

*Know* + object is used mainly to talk about knowledge that comes from direct personal experience. In other cases, we normally use *know about*/*of*, *have heard of* or another structure. Compare:

- *‘You don’t **know** my mother, do you?’ ‘No, I’ve never met her.’*
- *We all **know about** Abraham Lincoln.* (not *~~We all know Abraham Lincoln.~~*)

## *know* and *find out*, etc

*Know* is not normally used to talk about finding something out: to know something is ***to have learnt*** it, not ***to learn*** it. To talk about getting knowledge we can use for example *find out*, *get to know*, *learn*, *hear*, *can tell*.

- *‘She’s married.’ ‘Where did you **find** that **out**?’* (not *~~… Where did you know that?~~*)
- *I want to travel round the world and **get to know** people from different countries.* (not *~~… and know people …~~*)
- *He’s from Liverpool, as you can **tell** from his accent.* (not *~~… as you can know from his accent.~~*)

## *I know* and *I know it*

Note the difference between these two short answers.

*I know* refers to facts – it could be completed by a *that*\-clause.

- *‘You’re late.’ ‘**I know**.’* (= I know that I’m late.)

*I know it* generally refers to things – *it* replaces a noun.

- *‘I went to a nice restaurant called The Elizabeth last night.’ ‘**I know it**.’* (= I know the restaurant.)
