# long and (for) a long time

## *long* in questions and negatives

*Long* (meaning ‘(for) a long time’) is most common in questions and negative clauses, and with restrictive words like *hardly*, *seldom*.

- *Have you been waiting **long**?*
- *It doesn’t take **long** to get to her house.*
- *She seldom stays **long**.*

## *(for) a long time* in affirmative clauses

In affirmative clauses we usually prefer *(for) a long time*.

- *I waited **(for) a long time**, but she didn’t arrive.* (not *~~I waited long …~~*)
- *It takes **a long time** to get to her house.* (not *~~It takes long …~~*)

## *long* in affirmative clauses

However, *long* is used in affirmative clauses with *too*, *enough*, *as* and *so*, and in a few other common expressions.

- *The meeting went on much **too long**.*
- *I’ve been working here **long enough**. Time to get a new job.*
- *You can stay **as long** as you want.*
- *Sorry I took **so long**.*
- *I’ll be back **before long**.*
- *She sits dreaming **all day long**.* (also *all night/week/year long*)

*Long* is also used in affirmative clauses to modify adverbs and conjunctions.

- *We used to live in Paris, but that was **long before** you were born.*
- ***Long after** the accident he used to dream that he was dying.*
- ***Long ago**, in a distant country, there lived a beautiful princess.* (rather formal)

## *for a long time* in negative clauses

When *for a long time* is used in a negative clause, it sometimes has a different meaning from *for long*. Compare:

- *She didn’t speak **for long**.* (= She only spoke for a short time.)  
  *She didn’t speak **for a long time**. (This could mean ‘She was silent for a long time’ – the same as *For a long time she didn’t speak*).*
- *He didn’t work **for long**.* (= He soon stopped working.)  
  *He didn’t work **for a long time**. (This could mean ‘He was unemployed for a long time’ – the same as *For a long time he didn’t work*).*

The reason for the difference is to do with the ‘scope of negation’: in the first and third sentences, *not* goes with *for long*, but in the second and fourth *for a long time* is outside the influence of *not* (it could go at the beginning of the clause).

## *How long are you here for*?

Questions like *How long are you here for?* refer to the future. Compare:

- *‘**How long are you here for?’** ‘Until the end of next week.’*
- *‘**How long have you been here for?’** ‘Since last Monday.’*

## Comparative

The comparative of *for a long time* is *(for) longer*.

- *I hope you’ll stay longer next time.* (not *~~… for a longer time.~~*)

:::note

For *no longer*, [(see here)](./no-more-not-any-more-no-longer-not-any-longer).

*Much*, *many* and *far* are also more common in questions and negative clauses ( [(see here)](./../../grammar/determiners-quantifiers/much-and-many), [(see here)](./far-and-a-long-way).
