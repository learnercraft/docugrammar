# look

## Linking verb (= ‘seem’)

*Look* can mean ‘seem’ or ‘appear’. In this case it is a linking verb [(see here)](./../../grammar/verbs/linking-verbs-be-seem-look-etc) and can be followed by adjectives or (in British English) nouns.

- *You **look angry** – what’s the matter?* (not *~~You look angrily …~~*)
- *I **looked a real fool** when I fell in the river.* (BrE)
- *The garden **looks a mess**.* (BrE)

To talk about a temporary appearance, we can use simple or progressive forms; there is not much difference of meaning.

- ***You look / You’re looking** very unhappy. What’s the matter?*

*Look* can be followed by *like* or *as if* [(see here)](./as-if-and-as-though-like). Progressive forms are not usually used in this case.

- *She **looks like** her mother.*
- *It **looks as if** it’s going to rain.* (not *~~It’s looking as if …~~*)
- *She **looks as if** she’s dreaming.*
- *She **looks like** she’s dreaming.* (informal) (not *~~She looks like dreaming.~~*)

**Look like …ing** … (informal) is used with future reference in British English.

- *It **looks like being** a wet night.* (= It looks as if it will be …)

*Look* + infinitive is also sometimes used in informal British English.

- *The team **look to repeat** their success.* (= It looks as if they will …)

## Ordinary verb (= ‘direct one’s eyes’)

When *look* means ‘direct one’s eyes’, it is used with adverbs, not adjectives. Before an object, a preposition is necessary (usually *at*).

- *The boss **looked at me angrily**.* (not *~~The boss looked at me angry.~~*)

A preposition is not used when there is no object.

- ***Look!** It’s changing colour.* (not *~~Look at! …~~*)

## Not followed by *if*

Before *if* or *whether*, we use *see* or *look to see*, not *look*.

- *Could you **see if** Anna’s in the kitchen?* (not *~~Could you look if Anna’s in the kitchen?~~*)
- *‘What are you doing?’ ‘I’**m looking to see whether** these batteries are OK.’* (not *~~I’m looking whether…~~*)

## *look after* and *look for*; *fetch*

These are not the same. *Look after* means ‘take care of’; *look for* means ‘try to find’. Compare:

- *Could you **look after** the kids while I go shopping?*
- *I spent ages **looking for** her before I found her.*

*Fetch*, not *look for*, is used in British English, if we know where people or things are.

- *I’m going to the station at three o’clock **to fetch** Daniel.* (not *~~… to look for Daniel.~~*)
