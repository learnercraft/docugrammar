# marry and divorce

## *get married/divorced*

In an informal style, *get married* and *get divorced* are more common than *marry* and *divorce* when there is no object.

- *Lulu and Joe **got married** last week.* (*Lulu and Joe married …* is more formal.)
- *The Robinsons are **getting divorced**.*

In a more formal style, *marry* and *divorce* are preferred.

- *Although she had many lovers, she never **married**.*
- *After three very unhappy years they **divorced**.*

## No preposition before object

Before a direct object, *marry* and *divorce* are used without prepositions.

- *She **married a builder**.* (not *~~She married with a builder.~~*)
- *Andrew’s going to **divorce Carola**.*

## *get/be married to*

We can also use *get/be married to* with an object.

- *She **got married to** her childhood sweetheart.*
- *I’**ve been married to** you for 25 years and I still don’t understand you.*
