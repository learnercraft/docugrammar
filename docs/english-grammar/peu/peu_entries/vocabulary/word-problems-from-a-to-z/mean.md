## Questions

Note the structure of questions with *mean*.

- *Excuse me. What **does** ‘hermetic’ **mean**?* (not *~~What means ‘hermetic’?~~*)

Note also the preposition in *What do you mean **by** ‘hermetic’?* (= In what sense are you using the word?)

## *mean* and *think*, *meaning* and *opinion*

*Mean* and *meaning* are ‘false friends’ for speakers of some European languages. They are not usually used for ‘think’ or ‘opinion’.

- *I **think** that Labour will win the next election.* (not *~~I mean that Labour will win …~~*)
- *What’s your **opinion**?* (not *~~What’s your meaning?~~*)

## Structures

*Mean* (= intend, plan) can be followed by (object) + infinitive.

- *Sorry – I didn’t **mean to interrupt** you.*
- *Did you **mean Jack to pay** for everybody?*

*Mean* (= involve, have as a result) can be followed by a noun or an *\-ing* form.

- *The Fantasians have invaded Utopia. This **means war**!*
- *If you decide to try the exam, it will **mean studying** hard.*

## *I mean*

*I mean* is used informally as a ‘discourse marker’ to introduce explanations or additional details.

- *He’s funny – **I mean**, he’s really strange.*
- *It was a terrible evening. **I mean**, they all sat round and talked politics.*
- *Would you like to come out tonight? **I mean**, only if you want to, of course.*

When *I mean* introduces a comment it can be close to *I think* or *I feel*, but it is not followed by *that*.

- *A hundred pounds for a thirty-hour week. **I mean**, it’s not right, is it?* (but not *~~I mean that it’s not right …~~*)

In informal speech, *I mean* often acts as a connector or ‘filler’, with little real meaning.

- *Let’s go and see Jake on Saturday. **I mean**, we could make an early start …*

*I mean* is also used to introduce corrections.

- *She lives in Southport – **I mean** Southampton.*

## *What do you mean …*?

*What do you mean …*? can express anger or protest.

- ***What do you mean**, I can’t sing?*
- ***What do you mean** by waking me up at this time of night?*

## No progressive form

*Mean* is not normally used in progressive forms when it refers to meanings.

- *What **does** that strange smile **mean**?* (not *~~What is that strange smile meaning?~~*)

But perfect progressive forms can be used to refer to intentions.

- *I’**ve been meaning** to phone you for weeks.*
