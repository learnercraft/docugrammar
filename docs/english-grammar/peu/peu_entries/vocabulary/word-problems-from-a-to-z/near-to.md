# near (to)

*Near* can be used as a preposition. *Near to* is also possible with the same meaning, but is less common.

- *We live **near (to)** the station.*
- *I put my bag down **near (to)** the door.*
- *She was **near (to)** despair.*

*Near (to)* can be followed by an *\-ing* form.

- *I came very **near (to) hitting** him.*

:::note

For the difference between *nearest* and *next*, [(see here)](./next-and-the-next-nearest).
