# next and the next; nearest

## *next week*, *month*, etc; *the next week*, *month*, etc

*Next week*, *month*, etc (without *the*) is the week, month, etc just after this one. If I am speaking in July, *next month* is August; in 2016, *next year* is 2017.

*The* *next week*, *month*, etc is the period of seven, thirty, etc days starting at the moment of speaking. On July 15th 2016, *the* *next month* is the period from July 15th to August 15th; *the* *next year* is the period from July 2016 to July 2017. Compare:

- *Goodbye – see you **next week**.* (not *~~… see you the next week.~~*)  
  *I’ll be busy for **the** **next week**.* (= the seven days starting today)
- ***Next year** will be difficult.* (= the year starting next January)  
  ***The next year** will be difficult.* (= the twelve months starting now)

The difference between *last* and *the last* is similar, [(see here)](./last-the-last-the-latest).

## *the next three …*, etc

Note the word order in expressions with numbers.

- *I’ll be at college for **the next three** **years**.* (not *~~… the three next years.~~*)

We generally say *the next few days*, not *~~the next days~~*.

- ***The next few days** will be wet.*

## *next Sunday*, etc

When *next* is used with the names of days or months, it is not always clear exactly what is meant.

- *‘See you **next Sunday**.’ ‘Do you mean this coming Sunday or the one after?’*

To avoid misunderstanding, one can say for example (1) *on Sunday*, *this Sunday*, *the/this Sunday coming*, *the/this coming Sunday* or *(on) Sunday this week*, and (2) *on Sunday week*, *a week on Sunday* or *(on) Sunday next week*.

## Place: *next* and *nearest*

*The nearest* is generally preferred for place – it means ‘most near in space’.

- *Excuse me. Where’s **the nearest** bank?* (not *~~… the next bank.~~*)
- *If you want to find Luke, just look in **the nearest** pub.*

*The next* can be used for place if we are talking about movement or direction. It means ‘after this/that one’.

- *We get off at **the next** station.* (= the station that we will come to next.)
- *It’s not on this shelf; it’s on **the next** shelf up.*

*Next* can also be used to talk about the nearest position in a row.

- *My girlfriend lives **next** door.*
- *Who works in the **next** office?*
- *The people at the **next** table were having a terrible argument.*

*Next to* means ‘beside’.

- *Come and sit **next to** me.*
