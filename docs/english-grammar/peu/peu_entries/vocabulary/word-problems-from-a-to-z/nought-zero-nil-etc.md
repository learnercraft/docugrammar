# *nought*, *zero*, *nil*, etc

The figure *0* is usually called *nought* or *zero* in British English and *zero* in American English. When we say numbers one figure at a time, *0* is often called *oh* (like the letter *O*).

- *My account number is four one three **oh** six. or … four one three **zero** six.*

In measurements of temperature, *0* is called *zero* in both British and American English. *Zero* is followed by a plural noun.

- ***Zero degrees** Celsius is thirty-two degrees Fahrenheit.*

Zero scores in team games are called *nil* (American *zero* or *nothing*). In tennis and similar games, the word *love* is used (originally from French *l’oeuf*, meaning ‘the egg’ – the figure *0* is egg-shaped).

- *And the score at half-time is: Scotland three, England **nil**.*
- *Forty-**love**; Andrews to serve.*
