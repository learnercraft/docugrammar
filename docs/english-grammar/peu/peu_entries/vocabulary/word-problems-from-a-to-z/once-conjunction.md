# once: conjunction

*Once* can be used as a conjunction, meaning ‘after’, ‘as soon as’. It often suggests that something is finished or completed, and is most often used with a perfect tense.

- ***Once** you’ve passed your test I’ll let you drive my car.*
- ***Once** he had found somewhere to live he started looking for work.*
- ***Once** you know how to ride a bike you never forget it.*

Note that we do not use *that* after *once* *(not *~~Once that you’ve passed your test …~~*).*

:::note

For present perfect instead of future perfect after conjunctions, [(see here)](./../../grammar/conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/tense-simplification-in-subordinate-clauses).
