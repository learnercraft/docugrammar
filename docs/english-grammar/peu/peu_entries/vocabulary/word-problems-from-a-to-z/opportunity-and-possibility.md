# opportunity and possibility

We often say that somebody *has the opportunity to do / of doing* something.

- *I **have the opportunity to go** to Denmark next year.* (= I **can** go …)

*Possibility* is not often used in this structure. It is more normal to say that *there is a possibility of something happening*.

- ***There’s a possibility of my going** to Denmark next year.* (= I **may** go …) (More natural than *I have the possibility to go to Denmark …*)
