# prefer

When we say that we prefer one activity to another, two *\-ing* forms can be used. The second can be introduced by *to* or *rather than (more formal)*.

- *I prefer **riding to walking**.* (not *~~I prefer riding to walk.~~*)
- *She prefers **making** toys for her children **rather than buying** them.*

*Prefer* can also be followed by an infinitive (this is normal after *would prefer*). We can use an infinitive (without *to*) or an *\-ing* form after *rather than* in this case.

- *She **prefers to make** toys for her children **rather than buy**/**buying** them.*
- *I **would prefer to stay** at home **rather than drive**/**driving** to your motherâ€™s.*
