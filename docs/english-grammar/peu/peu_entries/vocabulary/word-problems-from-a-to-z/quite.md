# quite

## Two meanings

In British English, *quite* has two common meanings. Compare:

- *It’s **quite** good, but it could be better.* (= It’s OK, not bad.)
- *It’s **quite** impossible.* (= It’s completely impossible.)

*Good* is a ‘gradable’ adjective: things can be more or less good. With gradable words, *quite* usually means something similar to *fairly* or *rather* (for the differences, [(see here)](./fairly-quite-rather-and-pretty-adverbs-of-degree) in affirmative clauses. *Impossible* is non-gradable: things are either impossible or not; but they cannot be more or less impossible. With non-gradable words, *quite* means ‘completely’. Compare:

- *I’m **quite tired**, but I can walk a bit further.*  
  *I’m **quite exhausted** – I couldn’t walk another step.*
- *It’s **quite surprising**.* (similar to *fairly surprising*)  
  *It’s **quite amazing**.* (= absolutely amazing)
- *He speaks Portuguese **quite well**, but he’s got a strong English accent.*  
  *He speaks Portuguese **quite perfectly**.*
- *I **quite like** her, but she’s not one of my closest friends.*  
  *Have you **quite finished**?* (= Have you completely finished?)

In American English *quite* with gradable adjectives more often means something like ‘very’, not ‘fairly/rather’.

## Word order with nouns

*Quite* can be used with *a/an* + noun. It normally comes before *a/an* if there is a gradable adjective or no adjective.

- *It’s **quite a nice** day.*
- *We watched **quite an interesting** film last night.*
- *She’s **quite a** woman!*
- *The party was **quite a** success.*

With non-gradable adjectives, *quite* normally comes after *a/an* in British English.

- *It was **a quite perfect** day.* (AmE *It was quite a perfect day*.)

*Quite* is sometimes used before *the* to mean ‘exactly’, ‘completely’.

- *He’s going **quite the** wrong way.*
- ***quite the** opposite*

## Comparisons

*Quite* is not used directly before comparatives.

- *She’s **rather / much / a bit older** than me.* (but not *~~She’s quite older …~~*)

But we use *quite better* to mean ‘completely recovered’ (from an illness).

*Quite similar* means ‘fairly/rather similar’; *quite different* means ‘completely different’.

## *quite a bit/few/lot*, etc

*Quite a bit* and *quite a few* (informal) mean almost the same as *quite a lot*.

- *We’re having **quite a bit** of trouble with the kids just now.*
- *We thought nobody would be there, but actually **quite a few** people came.*

## *not quite*

*Not quite* means ‘not completely’ or ‘not exactly’. It can be used before adjectives, adverbs, verbs and nouns, including nouns with *the*.

- *I’m **not quite** ready – won’t be a minute.*
- *She did**n’t** run **quite fast** enough for a record.*
- *I do**n’t quite** agree.*
- *That’s **not quite** the colour I wanted.*
