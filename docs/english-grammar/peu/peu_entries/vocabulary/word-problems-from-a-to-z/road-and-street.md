# road and street

## The difference

A *street* is a road with houses on either side. We use *street* for roads in towns or villages, but not for country roads.

- *Cars can park on both sides of the **street** here.*
- *Our village has only got one **street**.*

*Road* is used for both town and country.

- *Cars can park on both sides of our **road**.*
- *The **road** out of our village goes up a steep hill.* (not *~~The street out of our village …~~*)

## Street names: stress

In street names we normally stress the word *Road*, but the word before *Street*.

- *Marylebone ˈRoad*
- *ˈOxford Street*
