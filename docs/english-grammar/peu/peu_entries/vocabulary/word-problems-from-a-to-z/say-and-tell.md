# say and tell

## Meaning and use

Both *say* and *tell* are used with direct and indirect speech. (*Say* is more common than *tell* with direct speech.)

- *‘Turn right,’ I **said**.* (or ‘Turn right,’ I **told** him.)
- *She **said** that it was my last chance.* (or She **told** me that it was my last chance.)

*Tell* is only used to mean ‘instruct’ or ‘inform’. So we do not use *tell* with greetings, exclamations or questions, for example.

- *He **said**, ‘Good morning.’* (but not *~~He told them, ‘Good morning.’~~*)
- *Emily **said**, ‘What a nice idea.’* (but not *~~Emily told us, ‘What a nice idea.’~~*)
- *‘What’s your problem?’ I **said**.* (but not *~~‘What’s your problem?’ I told her.~~*)

## *say*: objects

We *say **something (to somebody)***, not *~~say somebody something~~*.

- *He said **a few words to me** in Arabic.* (not *~~He said me a few words in Arabic.~~*)
- *She said **that she would be late**.* (not *~~She said me that …~~*)
- *And I **say to all the people** of this great country …* (not *~~And I say all the people …~~*)

## *tell*: objects

After *tell*, we usually say who is told.

- *She **told me** that she would be late.* (not *~~She told that …~~*)

*Tell* is used without a personal object in a few expressions. Common examples: *tell the truth*, *tell a lie*, *tell a story/joke*.

- *I don’t think she’s **telling the truth**.* (not *~~… saying the truth.~~*)

Note also the use of *tell* to mean ‘distinguish’, ‘understand’, as in *tell the difference*, *tell the time*.

- *He’s seven years old and he still can’t **tell the time**.*

*Tell* is not used before objects like *a word*, *a name*, *a sentence*, *a phrase*.

- *Alice **said a naughty word** this morning.* (not *~~Alice told …~~*)

We do not usually use *it* after *tell* to refer to a fact.

- *‘What time’s the meeting?’ ‘I’ll **tell you** tomorrow.’* (not *~~I’ll tell you it tomorrow.~~*)

## Infinitives

*Tell* can be used before object + infinitive, in the sense of ‘order’ or ‘instruct’. *Say* cannot be used like this.

- *I **told the children to go** away.* (not *~~I said the children to go away.~~*)

## Indirect questions

Neither *tell* nor *say* can introduce indirect questions [(see here)](./../../grammar/noun-clauses-direct-and-indirect-speech/indirect-speech-questions-and-answers).

- *James **asked** whether I wanted to see a film.* (not *~~James said whether I wanted to see a film.~~*) or *~~James told me whether …~~*

But *say* and *tell* can introduce the answers to questions.

- *Has she **said** who’s coming?*
- *He only **told** one person where the money was.*

For *so* after *say* and *tell*, [(see here)](./so-with-say-and-tell).
