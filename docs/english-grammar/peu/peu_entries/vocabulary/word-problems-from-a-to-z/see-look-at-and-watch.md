# see, look (at) and watch

## *see*

*See* is the ordinary verb to say that something ‘comes to our eyes’, whether or not we are paying attention.

- *Suddenly I **saw** something strange.* (not *~~Suddenly I looked at something strange.~~*)
- *Did you **see** the article about the strike in today’s paper?*

## *look (at)*

We use *look* to talk about concentrating, paying attention, trying to see what is there. You can *see* something without wanting to, but you can only *look at* something deliberately. Compare:

- *I **looked at** the photo, but I didn’t **see** anybody I knew.*
- *‘Do you **see** that man?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘**Look** again.’ ‘Oh no! It’s Moriarty!’*
- *He **looked at** her with his eyes full of love.*

When *look* has an object it is followed by *at*. When there is no object there is no preposition. Compare:

- ***Look at** me!* (not *~~Look me!~~*)
- ***Look**!* (not *~~Look at!~~*)

Note that *at* is often dropped before a *wh-*clause.

- ***Look (at) what** you’ve done!*
- ***Look who’**s here!*
- ***Look where** you’re going.*

## *watch*

*Watch* is like *look at*, but suggests that something is happening or going to happen. We *watch* things that change, move or develop.

- ***Watch** that man – I want to know everything he does.*
- *I usually **watch** a football match on Saturday afternoon.*

## Complete experiences: *see*

*Watch* is typically used to talk about experiences that are going on, in progress. We often prefer *see* to talk about the whole of a performance, play, film, match, etc. Compare:

- *He got into a fight yesterday afternoon while he was **watching** a football match.* (not *~~… while he was seeing a football match.~~*)
- *Have you ever **seen** Chaplin’s ‘The Great Dictator’?* (not *~~Have you ever watched Chaplin’s ‘The Great Dictator’?~~*)

## *watch TV*

*Watch* is normally used with *TV*; *watch* and *see* are both used to talk about TV programmes and films.

- *You spend too much time **watching TV**.*
- *We **watched**/**saw a great film** on TV last night.*

## *see if*/*whether*

*See* can be followed by *if*/*whether*, in the sense of ‘find out’. *Look* and *watch* are not normally used in this way.

- ***See if** that suit still fits you.* (not *~~Look if that suit …~~*)
- *I’m looking to **see whether** there’s any food left.* (not *~~I’m looking whether there’s …~~*)
- *Phone and **see whether** she’s in.*
