# seem

## Linking verb: used with adjectives

*Seem* is a linking verb [(see here)](./../../grammar/verbs/linking-verbs-be-seem-look-etc); it is followed by adjectives, not adverbs.

- *You **seem angry** about something.* (not *~~You seem angrily …~~*)

## *seem* and *seem to be*

*Seem* is often followed by *to be*. We prefer *seem to be* when we are talking about objective facts – things that seem definitely to be true. *Seem* is used without *to be* when we are talking about subjective impressions. (The difference is not always clear-cut, and both are often possible.) Compare:

- *The bus **seems to be** full.*  
  *She **seems** excited.*
- *The doctors have done the tests, and he definitely **seems to be** mentally ill.*  
  *It **seems** crazy, but I think I’m in love with my bank manager.* (not *~~It seems to be crazy …~~*)
- *According to the experts, the north side of the castle **seems to be** about 100 years older than the rest.*  
  *He **seems** older than he is.* (``not`` ~~He seems to be older than he is~~ – this would suggest that he might actually be older than he is.)
- *She doesn’t **seem to be** ready yet.*  
  *She **seems (to be)** very sleepy today.*

## With nouns

*Seem to be* is normal before noun phrases.

- *I looked through the binoculars: it **seemed to be** some sort of large rat.* (not *~~… it seemed some sort of large rat.~~*)
- *I spoke to a man who **seemed to be** the boss.* (not *~~… who seemed the boss.~~*)

However, *to be* can be dropped before noun phrases which express more subjective feelings, especially in British English.

- *She **seems** (to be) a nice girl.*
- *The cup **seemed** almost doll’s size in his hands.*
- *It **seems** a pity, but I can’t see you this weekend.* (not *~~It seems to be a pity …~~*)

## Other infinitives

*Seem* can be followed by the infinitives of other verbs besides *be*.

- *Anna **seems to need** a lot of attention.*

Perfect infinitives [(see here)](./../../grammar/infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles/infinitives-forms) are possible.

- *The tax people **seem to have made** a mistake.*

To express a negative idea, we most often use a negative form of *seem*; but in a more formal style *not* can go with the following infinitive. Compare:

- *He **doesn’t seem to be** at home.*
- *He **seems not to be** at home.* (formal)

Note the structure *can’t seem to …*

- *I **can’t seem to** get anything right.* (More formal: *I seem not to be able to get anything right.*)

## *seem like*

We can use *like*, but not *as*, after *seem*.

- *North Wales **seems (like)** a good place to go climbing.* (not *~~… seems as a …~~*)

## *it seems*

*It* can be a preparatory subject [(see here)](./../../grammar/information-structure/preparatory-it-subject) for *that-* and *as if-*clauses after *seem*.

- ***It seems that** James and Alice have had a quarrel.*
- ***It seemed as if** the night was never going to end.*

## *there seems*

*There* [(see here)](./there) can be a preparatory subject for *seem to be*.

- ***There seems to be** some mistake.*

:::note

For *like* and *as*, [(see here)](./like-and-as-similarity-function).

*Appear* is used in similar ways [(see here)](./appear).
