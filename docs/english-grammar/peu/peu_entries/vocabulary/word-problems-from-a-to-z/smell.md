# smell

## British and American forms

In British English, regular and irregular past tenses and participles are both common: *smelled* and *smelt*. American forms are usually regular.

## Linking verb

*Smell* can be used as a linking verb [(see here)](./../../grammar/verbs/linking-verbs-be-seem-look-etc), followed by an adjective or noun, to say how something smells. Progressive forms are not used.

- *Those roses **smell beautiful**.* (not *~~… smell beautifully.~~*)
- *The soup **smells funny**. What’s in it?* (not *~~… is smelling funny …~~*)

Before a noun, *smell of* and *smell like* are used.

- *The railway carriage **smelt of beer** and old socks.*
- *His aftershave **smelt like an explosion** in a flower shop.*

*Smell* is sometimes used to mean ‘smell bad’.

- *That dog **smells**.*

## Transitive verb: ‘perceive’

*Smell* can be used with an object, to say what we perceive with our noses. Progressive forms are not used. We often use *can smell* [(see here)](./../../grammar/modal-auxiliary-verbs/can-and-could-with-see-hear-etc).

- *As we walked into the house, we **smelt something** burning.*
- *I **can smell supper**.*

## Transitive verb: ‘investigate’

Another transitive use is to say that we are using our noses to find out something. Progressive forms can be used.

- *‘What are you doing?’ ‘I’**m smelling** the meat to see if it’s still OK.’*
