# so and not with hope, believe, etc

## Instead of *that*-clauses

We often use *so* after *believe*, *hope*, *expect*, *imagine*, *suppose*, *guess*, *reckon*, *think*, *be afraid*, instead of repeating words in a *that*\-clause.

- *‘Is Alex here?’ ‘I **think so**.’* (not *~~… I think that Alex is here.~~*)
- *‘Do you think we’ll be in time?’ ‘I **hope so**.’* (not *~~I hope.~~*)
- *‘Did you lose?’ ‘I’**m afraid so**.’*

We do not use *so* before a *that*\-clause.

- *I hope **that** we’ll have good weather.* (not *~~I hope so, that we’ll have good weather.~~*)

Note the special use of *I thought so* to mean ‘my suspicions were correct’.

- *Empty your pockets. Ah, **I thought so**! You’ve been stealing chocolate again.*

*So* is not used after *know* [(see here)](./know).

- *‘You’re late.’ ‘I **know**.’  or I **know that**.* (not *~~I know so.~~*)

## Negative structures

We can make these expressions negative in two ways.

:::tip[Grammar]

affirmative verb + *not*

:::

- *‘Did you win?’ ‘I’**m afraid not**.’*
- *‘We won’t be in time for the train.’ ‘No, I **suppose not**.’*

:::tip[Grammar]

negative verb + *so*

:::

- *‘You won’t be here tomorrow?’ ‘I do**n’t suppose so**.’*
- *‘Will it rain?’ ‘I do**n’t expect so**.’*

*Hope* and *be afraid* are always used in the first structure.

- *I **hope not**.* (not *~~I don’t hope so.~~*)

*Think* is more common in the second structure.

- *I do**n’t think so**.* (More common than *I think not.*)

## *so* at the beginning of a clause

We can use *so* at the beginning of a clause with *say*, *hear*, *understand*, *tell*, *believe* and a number of other verbs. This structure is used to say how the speaker learnt something.

- *It’s going to be a cold winter, or **so** the newspaper **says**.*
- *‘Emily’s getting married.’ ‘Yes, **so** I **heard**.’*
- *‘The Professor’s ill.’ ‘**So** I **understand**.’*
