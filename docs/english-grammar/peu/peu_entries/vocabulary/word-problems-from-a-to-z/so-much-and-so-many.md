# so much and so many

## The difference

The difference between *so much* and *so many* is the same as between *much* and *many* [(see here)](./../../grammar/determiners-quantifiers/much-and-many). *So much* is used with singular (uncountable) nouns; *so many* is used with plurals.

- *I had never seen **so much** food in my life.*
- *She had **so many** children that she didn’t know what to do.* (not *~~… so much children …~~*)

We use *so*, not *so much*, to modify adjectives and adverbs [(see here)](./so-degree-adverb-so-tired-so-fast#before-adjectives-and-adverbs).

- *You’re **so beautiful**.* (not *~~You’re so much beautiful.~~*)

But *so much* is used before comparatives [(see here)](./../../grammar/comparison/much-older-by-far-the-oldest-etc).

- *She’s **so much more** beautiful now.*

## *so much*/*many* without a noun

We can drop a noun after *so much*/*many*, if the meaning is clear.

- *I can’t eat all that meat – there’s **so much**!*
- *I was expecting a few phone calls, but not **so many**.*

## *so much* as an adverb

*So much* can be used as an adverb.

- *I wish you didn’t smoke **so much**.*

## Special structures with *so much*

We can use *not so much … as* or *not so much … but* to make corrections and clarifications.

- *It was**n’t so much** his appearance I liked **as** his personality.*
- *It’s **not so much** that I don’t want to go, **but** I just haven’t got time.*

In negative and *if*\-clauses, *so much as* can be used to mean ‘even’.

- *He did**n’t so much as** say thank you, after all we’d done for him.*
- ***If** he **so much as** looks at another woman, I’ll kill him.*
