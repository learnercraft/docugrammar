# soon, early and quickly

## *soon*

*Soon* means ‘a short time after now’ or ‘a short time after then’.

- *Get well **soon**.* (not *~~Get well early.~~*)
- *The work was hard at the beginning, but she **soon** got used to it.*
- *‘I’ll pay you **soon**.’ ‘The sooner the better.’*

:::note

For *no sooner … than*, [(see here)](./hardly-scarcely-and-no-sooner).

:::

## *early*

The adverb *early* means ‘near the beginning of the time-period that we are thinking about’. It does not usually mean ‘a short time after now/then’.

- ***Early** that week, Luke was called to the police station.*
- *We usually take a long break **early** in the year.* (not *~~… soon in the year.~~*)
- *I usually get up **early** and go to bed **early**.* (not *~~I usually get up soon …~~*)

Sometimes *early* means ‘before the expected time’.

- *The plane arrived twenty minutes **early**.*

*Early* can also be used as an adjective.

- *I caught an **early** train.*
- *You’re very **early**.*
- *It’s the **earliest** known example of a cave painting.*

In a formal style, the adjective *early* can sometimes have the same kind of meaning as *soon*.

- *I should be grateful for an **early** reply.*
- *Best wishes for an **early** recovery.*

A watch or clock is *fast* or *slow*, not *early* or *late*.

- *My watch is five minutes **fast**.*

## *quickly*

*Quickly* refers to the speed with which something is done. Compare:

- *Let’s get her to the doctor **quickly**.* (It’s urgent – we need to move fast.)  
  *I ought to see the doctor **soon**.* (not an emergency)
- *He did the repair **quickly** but not very well.*  
  *I hope you can do the repair **soon** – I need the car.*
