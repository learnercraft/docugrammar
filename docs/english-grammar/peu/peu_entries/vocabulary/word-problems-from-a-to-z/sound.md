# sound

*Sound* is a linking verb [(see here)](./../../grammar/verbs/linking-verbs-be-seem-look-etc). It is followed by adjectives, not adverbs.

- *You **sound unhappy**. What’s the matter?*

Progressive forms are not very common.

- *Your idea **sounds** great.* (not *~~Your idea’s sounding great.~~*)

However, progressive forms are possible when there is an idea of change.

- *The car **sounds** / **is sounding** a bit rough these days.*

*Sound* is often followed by *like* or *as if*/*though*.

- *That **sounds like** James coming up the stairs.*
- *It **sounds as if**/**though** he’s had a hard day.*
