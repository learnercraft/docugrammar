# such

## Word order

*Such* is used with nouns and noun phrases. It comes before *a*/*an*.

- ***such** people*
- ***such** interesting ideas*
- ***such a** decision* (not *~~a such decision~~*)

## ‘of this/that kind’

*Such* can mean ‘like this/that’, ‘of this/that kind’. This is most common in a formal style, with abstract nouns.

- *The committee wishes to raise fees. I would oppose **such** a decision.*
- *There are various forms of secret writing. **Such** systems are called ‘codes’.*

In an informal style, and with concrete nouns, we prefer *like this*/*that* or *this*/*that kind of*.

- *… systems **like this** are called …*
- *He’s got an old Rolls-Royce. I’d like a car **like that**.* (not *~~I’d like such a car.~~*)

## High degree

Another use of *such* is to talk about a high degree of some quality. In this sense, *such* is common before adjective + noun.

- *I’m sorry you had **such a bad journey**.* (= You had a very bad journey, and I’m sorry.)
- *It was a pleasure to meet **such interesting people**.*

*Such* is also possible with this meaning before a noun alone, when the noun has an emphatic descriptive meaning.

- *I’m glad your concert was **such a success**.*
- *Why did she make **such a fuss** about the dates?*

## *such* and *very*, *great*, etc

*Very*, *great* and similar words are also used to talk about a high degree of some quality. The difference is that they give new information; *such (= like this/that)* normally refers to information that is already known. Compare:

- *I’ve had a **very** bad day.* (giving information)  
  *Why did you have **such** a bad day?* (The information is already known.)
- *The weather was **very** cold.*  
  *I wasn’t expecting **such** cold weather.*
- *There was **great** confusion*  
  *Why was there **such** confusion?*

However, in a very informal style *such* can also be used to mean ‘very’ or ‘great’, especially in exclamations.

- *She has **such** a marvellous voice!*
- *He’s **such** an idiot!*

## *such … that*; *such … as to*

Structures with *very* cannot be followed directly by *that*\-clauses. Instead, we can use *such … that*.

- *It was **such** a cold afternoon **that** we stopped playing.* (not *~~It was a very cold afternoon that …~~*)

There is also a structure with *such* followed by … + *as to* + infinitive. This is formal and not very common.

- *It was **such** a loud noise **as to wake** everybody in the house.* (Less formal: *… *such* a loud noise *that it woke* …*)

## *such as*

*Such as* is used to introduce examples.

- *My doctor told me to avoid fatty foods **such as** bacon or hamburgers.*

## *such-and-such*

Note this informal expression.

- *She’s always telling you that she’s met **such-and-such** a famous person.* (= … one or other famous person.)
