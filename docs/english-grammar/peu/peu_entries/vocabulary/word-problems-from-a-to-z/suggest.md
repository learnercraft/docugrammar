# suggest

## Infinitive not used

*Suggest* is not followed by object + infinitive. *That*\-clauses and *\-ing* structures are common.

- *Her uncle **suggested that** she (should) get a job in a bank.*
- *Her uncle **suggested getting** a job in a bank.*
- (not *~~Her uncle suggested her to get a job in a bank.~~*)

## Indirect object not used

*Suggest* is not normally followed by an indirect object without a preposition.

- *Can you **suggest** a restaurant **to us**?* (not *~~Can you suggest us a restaurant?~~*)

## Verb forms in *that*-clauses

In *that*\-clauses after *suggest*, various verb forms are possible when we suggest what people should do.

Ordinary present and past tenses can be used.

- *Her uncle **suggests** that she **gets** a job in a bank.*
- *He **suggested** that she **got** a job in a bank.*

*Should* + infinitive without *to* is common.

- *He **suggests** that she **should get** a job in a bank.*
- *He **suggested** that she **should get** a job in a bank.*

Subjunctives [(see here)](./../../grammar/conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/subjunctive-that-she-go-that-they-be-if-i-were-etc) are also used, especially in American English.

- *He **suggests** that she **get** a job in a bank.*
- *He **suggested** that she **get** a job in a bank.*

## Direct suggestions

In direct suggestions (‘I suggest …’), *should* is not generally used.

- *I suggest (that) **you get** …* (not *~~I suggest that you should get.~~*)
