# taste

## Linking verb

*Taste* can be used as a linking verb [(see here)](./../../grammar/verbs/linking-verbs-be-seem-look-etc), followed by an adjective or noun, to say how something tastes. Progressive forms are not used.

- *This **tastes nice**. What’s in it?* (not *~~… tastes nicely.~~*)
- *The wine **tastes funny**.* (not *~~… is tasting funny …~~*)

Before a noun, *taste of* and *taste like* are used.

- *The fish soup **tasted** mostly **of garlic**.*
- *Her lips **tasted like** wild **strawberries**.*

## Transitive verb: ‘perceive’

*Taste* can be used with an object, to say what we perceive with our sense of taste. Progressive forms are not used. We often use *can taste* [(see here)](./../../grammar/modal-auxiliary-verbs/can-and-could-with-see-hear-etc).

- *I **can taste onion** and mint in the sauce.* (not *~~I am tasting …~~*)

## Transitive verb: ‘investigate’

Another transitive use is to say that we are using our sense of taste to find out something. Progressive forms can be used.

- *‘Stop eating the cake.’ ‘I’**m** just **tasting** it to see if it’s OK.’*
