# (the) rest

*The rest* means ‘what is left’. It is singular in form, and *the* is always used.

- *We only use three rooms. **The rest** of the house is empty.*

To talk about what is left after something has been used up, eaten, destroyed, etc, we often use other words.

- *There were **remains** of the meal all over the floor.* (not *~~There were rests …~~*)
- *Supper tonight is **leftovers** from lunch.* (not *~~… rests …~~*)
- *If you divide 100 by 12, **the remainder** is 4.*

When *the rest* refers to a plural noun, it has a plural verb.

- *There are four chocolates for Penny, four for Joe and **the rest are** mine.* (not *~~… the rest is mine.~~*)
