# time

## Countability and article use

*Time* has various uses, some countable and some uncountable (for full details see a good dictionary). Most of these are straightforward, but there are problems in two areas:

## Measure of duration: how long

When we talk about the number of hours, days, etc that are needed to complete something, *time* is generally uncountable (and therefore used without *a*).

- *How **much time** do we need to load the van?*
- *It took quite **some time** to persuade her to talk to us.*
- *Don’t worry – there’s plenty of **time**.*
- *This is a complete waste of **time**.*

However, *time* is countable in certain expressions like *a long/short time* and *quite a time* (BrE).

- *I took **a long time** to get to sleep.*
- *She was away for **quite a time**.*

*The time* can be used to mean ‘enough time’; *the* is often dropped.

- *Just come with me – I haven’t got **(the) time** to explain.*

:::note

For the use of *take* with expressions of time, [(see here)](./take-time).

## Clock times

When we talk about clock times, *time* is countable.

- *Six o’clock would be **a** good **time** to meet.*
- *She phoned me at various **times** yesterday.*

*The* is dropped in the expression *it’s time*.

- ***It’s time** to stop.* (not *~~It’s the time to stop.~~*)

## Without preposition

Prepositions are often dropped before some common expressions with *time*.

- *He’s busy. Why don’t you come **another time**?* (More natural than *… at another time.*)
- ***What time** does the match start?* (More natural than *At what time …?*)
- *You won’t fool me **this time**.*

In relative structures after *time*, *that* is often used instead of *when* in an informal style (or dropped).

- *Do you remember the time **(that) Freddy pretended to be a ghost**?*
- *You can come up and see me any time **(that) you like**.*
- *The first time **(that) I saw her**, my heart stopped.*

:::note

For similar structures with other time words, and with *place*, *way* and *reason*, [(see here)](./../../grammar/relative-clauses/relatives-advanced-points#when-where-etc-replaced-by-that-or-dropped).

:::

## *on time* and *in time*

*On time* means ‘at the planned time’, ‘neither late nor early’. The opposite is ‘early’ or ‘late’. It is often used to refer to timetabled events.

- *Only one of the last six trains has been **on time**.* (not *~~… in time.~~*)
- *Daniel wants the discussion to start exactly **on time**.* (not *~~… in time.~~*)

*In time* means ‘with enough time to spare’, ‘before the last moment’. The opposite is *too late*.

- *We arrived **in time** to get good seats.* (not *~~… on time to get good seats.~~*)
- *He would have died if they hadn’t got him to the hospital **in time**.* (not *~~… got him to the hospital on time.~~*)
- *I nearly drove into the car in front, but I stopped just **in time**.*

For *by the time*, [(see here)](./by-time).
