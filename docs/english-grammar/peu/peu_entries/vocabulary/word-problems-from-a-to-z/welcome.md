# welcome

Note the common negative meaning of ‘welcome to it’.

- *‘Aren’t you worried that somebody will steal your car?’ ‘They’re **welcome to it**. It’s more trouble than it’s worth.’*

Compare:

- ***Welcome to** London!*
- *London – you’re **welcome to it**!* (= I hope you like it more than I do.)
