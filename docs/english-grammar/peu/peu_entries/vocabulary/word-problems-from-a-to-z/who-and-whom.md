# who and whom

*Whom* is unusual in informal modern English.

## Questions: *Who did they arrest*?

We normally use *who* as an object in questions.

- ***Who** did they arrest?*

Prepositions usually come at the end of *who*\-questions [(see here)](./../../grammar/prepositions/prepositions-at-the-ends-of-clauses).

- *Who did she go **with**?*

In a very formal style, *whom* is sometimes used.

- ***Whom** did they arrest?* (formal)

Prepositions normally come before *whom*.

- ***With whom** did she go?* (very formal)

## Relative clauses: *the man (who) we met*

In identifying relative clauses, [(see here)](./../../grammar/relative-clauses/identifying-and-non-identifying-clauses-the-tall-man-who-mr-rogers-who), *whom* is unusual in an informal style. Either we leave out the object pronoun, or we use *that* or *who* ( [(see here)](./../../grammar/relative-clauses/relatives-basic-information) for details).

- *Thereâ€™s the man **(that)/(who)** we met in the pub last night.*

In a formal style *whom* is more common.

- *She married a man **whom** she met at a conference.*

In non-identifying relative clauses [(see here)](./../../grammar/relative-clauses/identifying-and-non-identifying-clauses-the-tall-man-who-mr-rogers-who), we usually use *whom* as an object when necessary (but these clauses are uncommon in informal English).

- *This is John Perkins, **whom** you met at the sales conference.*
- *I have a number of American relatives, most of **whom** live in Texas.*

## *who(m) he thought*, etc

In a sentence like *He was trying to find an old school friend, who(m) he thought was living in New Zealand*, people are often unsure whether *whom* is possible (because it seems to be the object of the first following verb) or whether they should use *who* (because it is the subject of the second verb). *Who* is considered more correct, but *whom* is sometimes used. Another example:

- *There is a child in this class **who(m)** I believe is a musical genius.*

In cases with a following infinitive, usage is mixed, but *whom* is considered more correct.

- *There is a child in the class **who(m)** I believe to be a musical genius.*
