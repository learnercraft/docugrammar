# wish

## *wish* + infinitive

We can use *wish* + infinitive to mean *want*. *Wish* is very formal in this sense. Note that progressive forms are not used.

- *I **wish to see** the manager, please.* (not *~~I’m wishing to see …~~*)
- *If you **wish to reserve** a table, please telephone after five o’clock.*

An object + infinitive structure is also possible.

- *We do not **wish our names to appear** in the report.*

*Wish* + direct object is not normal without a following infinitive.

- *I **want** / **would like an appointment** with the manager.* (not *~~I wish an appointment with the manager.~~*)

## *I wish you …*

*Wish* is used with two objects in some fixed expressions of good wishes.

- *I wish **you a Merry Christmas**.*
- *We all wish **you a speedy recovery**.*
- *Here’s wishing **you all the best** in your new job.*

## *wish* + *that*-clause: meaning

We can also use *wish* with a *that*\-clause (*that* can be dropped in an informal style). In this case, *wish* does not mean ‘want’ – it expresses regret that things are not different, and refers to situations that are unreal, impossible or unlikely. Tenses are similar to those used with *if* (see below).

- *I **wish** (that) I was better looking.*
- *Don’t you **wish** (that) you could fly?*
- *We all **wish** (that) the snow would stay forever.*

*Wish* + *that*\-clause is not generally used for wishes about things that seem possible in the future. We often use *hope* in this sense [(see here)](./hope).

- *I **hope** you pass your exams.* (not *~~I wish you would pass your exams.~~*)
- *I **hope** you feel better tomorrow.* (not *~~I wish you felt better tomorrow.~~*)

## *wish* + *that*-clause: tenses

In a *that*\-clause after *wish*, we generally use the same tenses as we would use, for instance, after ‘It would be nice if …’ [(see here)](./../../grammar/if/special-structures-with-past-tenses-and-would). Past tenses are used with a present or future meaning.

- *I wish I **spoke** Japanese.* (= It would be nice if I spoke Japanese.)
- *I wish I **had** a yacht.*
- *I wish tomorrow **was** Sunday.*
- *All the staff wish you **weren’t** leaving so soon.*
- *Do you ever wish you **lived** somewhere else?*

*Were* can be used instead of *was* in this structure, especially in a formal style.

- *I wish that I **were** better looking.*

Past perfect tenses are used for wishes about the past.

- *I wish you **hadn’t said** that.* (= It would be nice if you hadn’t said that.)
- *Now she wishes she **had studied** harder.*

In informal speech, sentences like *I wish you’d have seen it* sometimes occur.

## *wish … would*

*Would* is very common in *that*\-clauses after *wish* (much more common than it is in *if*\-clauses). Sentences with *wish … would* express regret or annoyance that something will not happen.

- *Everybody wishes you **would** go home.* (= Why won’t you go home?)
- *I wish you **would** stop smoking.* (= Why won’t you stop smoking?)
- *I wish Jack **would** call me.* (But it looks as if he won’t.)
- *I wish it **would** stop raining.* (= It will keep on raining!)
- *Don’t you wish that this moment **would** last forever?*

Sentences with *wish … wouldn’t* refer to things that do or will happen.

- *I wish you **wouldn’t** keep making that stupid noise.* (= You will keep making …)

*Wish … would(n’t)* can be like an order or a critical request. Compare:

- *I wish you **wouldn’t** drive so fast.* (Similar to *Please don’t drive so fast.*)  
  *I wish you **didn’t** drive so fast.* (More like *I’m sorry you drive so fast.*)
- *I wish you **wouldn’t** work on Sundays.* (= Why don’t you stop?)  
  *I wish you **didn’t** work on Sundays.* (= It’s a pity.)
