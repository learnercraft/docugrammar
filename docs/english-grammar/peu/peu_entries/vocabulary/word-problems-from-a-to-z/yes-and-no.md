# yes and no

## Answers to negatives

In English, *yes* is used with affirmative sentences and *no* with negative sentences. In answers to negative questions and statements, *yes* and *no* are chosen according to the form of the answer, not in order to show agreement or disagreement with the speaker.

- *‘Aren’t you going out?’ ‘**No, I’m not**.’* (not *~~Yes, I’m not.~~*)
- *‘I have no money.’ ‘**No, I haven’t** either.’* (not *~~Yes, I haven’t too.~~*)
- *‘Haven’t you got a raincoat?’ ‘**Yes, I have**.’* (not *~~No, I have.~~*)

## Contradicting

Some languages have a special word for contradicting negative statements or suggestions (e.g. French *si* or German *doch*). English does not have a word like this. We often use a short answer structure [(see here)](./../../grammar/speech-and-spoken-exchanges/short-answers-yes-he-can-etc).

- *‘The phone isn’t working.’ ‘**(Yes,) it is**.’* (not *~~‘The phone isn’t working.’ ‘Yes.’~~*)

Affirmative sentences are contradicted with negative short answers.

- *‘It’s raining.’ ‘**(No,) it isn’t**.’*
