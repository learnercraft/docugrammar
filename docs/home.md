# Main page

Browse the reference material you want on the top.

On small screens, you may want to tap on the hamburger button on the top left.

You can also use the search function to browse the topic. Please note that as of now, the offline version does not support search functionality (you can expand the topics manually to find which one you want).

:::tip

It is not necessary to learn everything at once. Instead, choose the topics that you struggle the most. You will then gradually learn more as you progress.

For advanced learners, you can choose topics that you want to learn in depth. There's a good chance you may learn something new that you haven't come across. Example: [American English vs. British English](./peu/peu_entries/grammar/varieties-of-english/american-and-british-english) in *Practical English Usage*.
