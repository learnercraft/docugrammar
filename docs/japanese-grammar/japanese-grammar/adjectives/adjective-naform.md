# Na-Adjectives

Na-adjectives are one of two main groups of adjectives, the other group being i-adjectives. Na-adjectives act exactly like nouns, and follow the same conjugation rules that nouns follow.

## Common Na-Adjectives

- ``きれい``  
  Beautiful

- ``有名``  
  Famous

- ``親切``  
  Kind

- ``好き``  
  To like

## Conjugating Na-Adjectives

Na-adjectives follow the same conjugations rules as nouns. This is demonstrated in the table below:

### Plain Form

||Affirmative|Negative|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Non-past|綺麗だ|綺麗じゃない|
|Past|綺麗だった|綺麗じゃなかった|

### Polite Form

||Affirmative|Negative|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Non-past|綺麗です|綺麗じゃありません|
|Past|綺麗でした|綺麗じゃありませんでした|

## Modifying Nouns

Na-adjectives can modify nouns that follow them by adding `な` between the adjective and the noun, hence the name na-adjectives.

- ``きれいな景色です。``  
  A beautiful view.

- ``有名な友達です。``  
  A famous friend.

## An Unusual Adjective

`好き` is an adjective that means 'to like'. In English, to like is a verb, but in Japanese it is one of the most commonly used na-adjectives.

## Example Sentences

- ``福岡が綺麗だ。``  
  Fukuoka is beautiful.

- ``福岡が綺麗じゃありません。``  
  Fukuoka isn't beautiful.

- ``福岡が綺麗でした。``  
  Fukuoka was beautiful.

- ``福岡が綺麗じゃなかった。``
