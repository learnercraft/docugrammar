# Adjectives/Nouns with の

Take the following sentence, 'I have a big dog, I have a small one two.' In the sentence there are two different dogs, but the word dog is only used once. Instead we use the word 'one' to avoid repetition. The same thing can be achieved with の.

## Using の

The basic format is this:  

:::tip[ ]

**i-adjective/na-adjective** + **noun** + **i-adjective/na-adjective** + **の**.

:::

With this, you can make a sentence such as:  

- ``大きい犬がいます。小さいのもいます。``  
  I have a big dog. I have a small one too.

## Noun(A) の Noun(B)

The above example implies possession. In this case Noun(A) possesses Noun(B). This type of sentence can similarly be simplified with の to reduce repetition of Noun(B)

- **Q**: これはオスカーさんの傘ですか。  
  Is this Oscar's umbrella?  
- **A**: はい、オスカーさん**の**です。  
  Yes, it's Oscar's.
