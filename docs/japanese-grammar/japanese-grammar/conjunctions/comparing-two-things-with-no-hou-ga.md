# Comparing Two Things with の方が

Direct comparison of two things in Japanese is made possible through `の方が`.

This construct can be used in statements 'X is more-adjective than Y', or to ask questions 'which is more-adjective, X or Y?'

## Using の方が

### Making Comparisons

This is the basic format for using `の方が` in a sentence:

- **X** の方が **Y** より **adjective**

Where X possesses more of the adjective than Y. Adjectives need not be conjugated in any special way.

For example:

1. ``ラーメンの方がうどんよりおいしいです。``  
(Ramen is more delicious than Udon.)
2. ``スキーの方がスノーボードより楽しい。``  
(Skiing is more fun than snowboarding.)

### Asking Opinions

The construct can also be used to ask someone to compare between two things and express their opinion on the subject. The basic format is this:

- **X** と **Y** と どっちの方が **adjective** ですか。

For example:

1. ``自電車と地下鉄どっちの方が簡単ですか。``  
(Which is easier, bicycle or subway?)
2. ``ラーメンとうどんとどっちの方が安い？``  
(Which is cheaper, ramen or udon?)

To answer questions like this, you can use the format in the 'making comparisons' section above, or shorten your answer like so.

- Q: ``ラーメンとうどんとどっちの方が安い？``  
(Which is cheaper, ramen or udon?)
- A: ``ラーメンの方が安い。``  
(Ramen is cheaper.)

## Giving advice

`方がいい` can be used a sentence ender to offer advice to someone, effectively saying 'this is the better course'. If using `方がいい` to give advice, beware conjugations. When the advice is in the affirmative `方がいい` follows a verb in its past, plain-form. If giving negative, the verb is conjugated to its present-tense, plain form.

- Affirmative: もっと水を**飲んだ**方がいいです。- You should drink more water.
- Negative: 毎日お酒を**飲まない**方がいいです。- You shouldn't drink sake every day.

## Example Sentences

- ``自営業の方がいい。``  
  I prefer to work on my own.

- ``私の方が背が高い。``  
  I am taller.

- ``イギリス人女性の52%はセックスよりもチョコレートの方が好きだ。``  
  Fifty-two per cent of British women prefer chocolate to sex.

- ``やっぱり都会より田舎の方が大らかな人が多いのかな。``  
  I think that there are more people in the countryside with a big heart than there are in the city.

- ``旅行するならわたしは飛行機の方が好きです。``  
  When I travel, I prefer to travel by air.
