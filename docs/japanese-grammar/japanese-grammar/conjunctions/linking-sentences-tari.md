# Linking Sentences with たり

There are multiple ways to link sentences in Japanese, and one of the most common ways is to use the [te-form](linking-together-activities-te-form). Here, we introduce `たり`, a more advanced way of linking sentences.

## て vs たり

Both link sentences, so what's the difference? If you link a sentence with the te-form, there is an implication that what you are saying are the only things that were done, or will be done. Take the following sentence:

- ``福岡で海で泳いで、宝満山に登ります。``  
  In Fukuoka, I will swim in the sea, and climb Mt Homan.

This translates to, 'In Fukuoka, I will swim in the sea, and climb Mt Homan.' Using `て` here to link sentences implies these are the only activities you are going to do in Fukuoka.

If you plan to do more, but only want to give a couple of examples, use `たり`.

## Using たり

The basic format of a sentence using `たり` is this:

Verb 1 **たり** Verb 2 **たり + する**

If we rework the sentence above so that it uses `たり`, it would read so:

- ``福岡で海で泳いだり、宝満山に登りたりします。``  
  In Fukuoka, I will swim in the sea, climb Mt Homan (amongst other things).

This now translates to, 'In Fukuoka, I will swim in the sea, climb Mt Homan (amongst other things).'

## Conjugating to たり

To use `たり` with a verb, conjugate the verb to its [ta-form](../verbs/verb-shortformpastaffirmative) and then add `り`. To provide the tense of the sentence, conjugate the `する` after the final `たり`.

Adjectives can also used by adding `り` to the adjectives short-form past tense, e.g. 大きかったり高かったりする。

## Alternate meanings

The `たり` construct can also be used to say 'sometimes', for example:

- ``あのスーパーの果物は新しかったり古かったりする。``  
  That shop's fruit is sometimes fresh and sometimes old.

## Example Sentences

- ``明日は英語を見たり、買い物したりする。``  
  I will go to shopping (and so on tomorrow.)

- ``走ったり騒いだりしないでください。``  
  Please do not run or be noisy.

- ``福岡で海で泳いだり、宝満山に登りたりします。``  
  In Fukuoka, I will swim in the sea, climb Mt Homan (amongst other things.)

- ``私達は歌ったり踊ったりしました。``  
  Amongst other things, we sang and danced.

- ``フランス語の先生はフランス人だったりイギリス人だったりします。``  
  French teachers are sometimes Japanese and sometimes English
