# Using から to Mean Because

A sentence ending in `から` will very likely indicate that the sentence is explaining the cause of something, working like the English word 'because'.

The word can be used at the end of a standalone sentence, or can be used as a conjunction to link two sentences together. Take the two examples below:

- ``明日テニスをすることができない。雨が降るから。``  
  Tomorrow we can't play tennis. Because it will rain.

- ``雨が降るから, 明日テニスをすることができない。``  
  Because it will rain, we can't play tennis tomorrow.

In the first example, the first sentence acts as a statement, and then the second sentence acts as the explanation, using `から` to mean because.

In the second example, the two sentences are linked using `から` and their order is reversed, so that the explainer comes first 'Because it will rain' and the statement second 'we can't play tennis tomorrow'.

`から` can follow either the plain form or the polite form and no special conjugation is needed.

## Example Sentences

- ``駄目だよ。君、背が高いんだから前衛に来てくれないと。``  
  That's no good! You're tall so you've got to be in the forward defence.

- ``今日はとても忙しいから一緒に行けないの。``  
  I can't go with you today because I'm very busy.

- ``どうして花を買ったか？なんでそんな質問を俺にするんだ？買いたかったから買っただけだ。``  
  Why did I buy flowers?! Why are you asking me a question like that? I bought them because I wanted to buy them, ok!

- ``ケンジの奴、二股かけてたから、思いっきりひっぱたいてやったよ。``  
  That damn Kenji, because he was cheating on me with another woman, I slapped him as hard as I could.
