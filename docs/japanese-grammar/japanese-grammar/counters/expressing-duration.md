# Expressing Duration

If you want to express the duration of an activity in Japanese, you need to use nouns such as `一時間` (one hour). Unlike other expressions of time, these nouns need no particle and usually appear immediately before a verb.

## Vocabulary

- かかります - to take (an amount of time)
- どのぐらいかかりますか - how long does it take?
- 間 - duration suffix
- ぐらい - about
- 何時間 - how many hours?
- 一時間/二時間/三時間 - one hour/two hours/three hours
- 何日間？ - how many days?
- 四日間/五日間/六日間 - four days, five days, six days
- 何週間？ - how many weeks?
- 七週間/八週間/九週間 - seven weeks, eight weeks, nine weeks
- 何ヶ月？ - how many months?
- 一ヶ月/二ヶ月/三ヶ月 - one month, two months, three months
- 何年間？ - how many years?
- 四年間/五年間/六年間 - four years, five years, six years

## Inexact Durations

If you want to add some ambiguity to your expression of duration, you can follow the noun with the word `ぐらい`.

- 一時間 - an hour
- 一時間ぐらい - about an hour

`ぐらい` is the most informal way of expressing inexact durations. `程` and `程度` are often used in the place of `ぐらい` if the speaker wishes to sound more formal.

## Asking 'How Long?'

If you want to ask how long something takes, you can use the question `どのぐらいかかりますか`. If you know more precisely the length of time something is going to take, you can use question words such as `何日間` in place of `どのぐらい`.

- ``福岡までどのぐらいかかりますか。``  
  How long does it take to get to Fukuoka?

- ``新幹線で福岡まで何時間かかりますか。`` (How many hours does it take to get to Fukuoka by Shinkansen?
