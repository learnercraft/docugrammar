# Specifying Objects with この, その & あの

`この`, `その` and `あの` are closely related in function to `これ`, `それ` and `あれ`.

However `この`, `その` and `あの` add a higher level of specificity to the conversation than `これ`, `それ` and `あれ` and are always used in conjunction with nouns.

## Usage

`この`, `その` and `あの` are used in conjunction with a noun to make phrases such as 'this apple' or 'that hat'.

- ``この`` - used when talking about a thing near to the speaker, in the same way that you would use 'this' in English.
- ``その`` - used when talking about something that is closer to the listener than to the speaker, equivalent to 'that'.
- ``あの`` - used when talking about something that is close to neither the speaker nor the listener, again equivalent to the English word 'that'.
- ``どの`` - followed by a noun to mean 'which', for example `どのお菓子が一番美味しいですか。` (Which sweet is the tastiest?). In this context, `どの`, or the noun following it, is always followed by the particle `が` and never `は`.
