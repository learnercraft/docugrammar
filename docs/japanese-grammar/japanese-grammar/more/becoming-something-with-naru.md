## Using なる with Nouns

To make sentences with nouns such as 'he/she has become a doctor' we use the `なる` with the particle に:

> **noun** + **に** + **なる**.

`なる` is conjugated to provide the sentence's tense, etc. For example:

- ``医者になった。``  
  I became a doctor.

- ``親切な人になる。``  
  To become a kind person.

## Using なる with Adjectives

Sentences with `なる` are formed slightly differently depending on whether `なる` follows an i-adjective or a na-adjective.

### I-Adjectives

When using `なる` with i-adjectives, the adjectives must first be conjugated. To conjugate the adjective correctly, simply cut the last `い` in the i-adjective, and add `く`. Then add `なる`.

- ``天気が悪くなりました。``  
  The weather got worse.

- ``風が強くなる。``  
  The wind is getting stronger.

### Na-Adjectives

Na-adjectives follow the same rules as nouns, and the pattern is: **na-adjective** + **に** + **なる**. なる is conjugated to provide the sentence's tense, etc.

- ``有名になった。``  
  He became famous.

- ``上手になりたい。``  
  I want to be good.

## Example Sentences

- ``明日は良い天気になる。``  
  It is going to be a good weather tomorrow.

- ``僕は君のようにはならない。``  
  I won't become like you.

- ``彼らは大きな会社にならなかった。``  
  They didn't become a big company.

- ``この子は将来絶対可愛くなる。``  
  This girl will be good looking for sure.

- ``その一家は幸せになはならなかった``
