# Modifying Nouns

In Japanese, nouns can be modified by sentences to provide more context to the noun in question. For example:

- ``昨日買った食べ物``  
  The food bought yesterday.

In this sentence, the noun `食べ物` is modified by the sentence `昨日買った`.

Sentences which are used to modify nouns are always in the short form. When the modifying sentence is paired with the noun, the entire compound acts as one giant noun and can be incorporated into longer sentences in the same way as an ordinary noun. For example:

- ``これは昨日買った食べ物です。``  
  This is the food I bought yesterday.

If the modifying sentence contains the topic particle `は`, this is replaced by the subject particle `が`. For example if `彼女は買った` is used to modify a noun, `は` is replaced with `が`.

- ``これは昨日彼女が買った食べ物です。``  
  This is the food she bought yesterday.

## Name + という + Noun

If you want to specify the name of a noun, for example a dog or a cat, you can use the following expression

> Name + と言う + Noun.

For example:

- ``スイフトと言う猫を飼っている。``  
  I have a cat called Swift.

## Example Sentences

- ``オスカーさんは、いつも勉強する人だ。``  
  Oscar is a person who studies a lot.

- ``これは 私がと友達にあげる ケーキです。``  
  This is the cake I gave to my friend.

- ``これは母がつくったセーターです。``  
  This is the sweater my mother made.

- ``お父さんは 私が先週山で撮った写真を見ています。``  
  My father is looking at the photos I took of the mountain last week.

- ``先週、トミさんが歌った曲のタイトルは何か知ってる？``  
  Do you know the name of the song that Tommy sang last week?
