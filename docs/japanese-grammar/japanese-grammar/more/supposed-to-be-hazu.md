# Supposed to be: はずです

If something *is* expected, supposed to be the case, or the norm, you can state this by using `はずです`. The past tense `はずでした` can be used to say something *was* expected or supposed to be the case.

## Using はずです

### With verbs

`はずです` is used following a verb in the plain form, for example:

- ``彼は今頃はそこに着いているはずだ。``  
  He ought to have arrived there by now.

### With i-adjectives

`はずです` is used following an i-adjective in the plain form, e.g.

- ``面白いはずだ``  
  Supposed to be interesting

### With na-adjectives

`はずです` is used following a na-adjective plus the kana `な`

- ``綺麗なはずです``  
  Expected to be beautiful

### With nouns

`はずです` is used following a na-adjective plus the kana `の`

- ``イギリス人のはずです``  
  Supposed to be British

## In the Negative

To state negative expectations, the word preceding `はず` can either be conjugated to its negative plain form, or `はず` can be modified using `がない`:

- ``オスカーさんはレストランに行かないはずだ。``  
  I don't expect Oscar will go to the restaurant.

- ``オスカーさんはレストランに行くはずがない。``  
  I don't expect Oscar will go to the restaurant.

## Notes

`はず` cannot be used to say that someone is supposed to do something because of duty, responsibility, obligation, law etc.

If using `はずでした`, the sentence that proceeds it is always in the present tense.

`はず` is not used if guessing or expressing probability, rather it is used to express expectations based on some prior knowledge.

`はず` is never used on its own and is always modified by the preceding sentence or demonstrative.

## Example Sentences

- ``プログラムは今頃もう始まっているはずです。だから、前半はたぶん観られないでしょう。``  
  The program should have started by now, so we'll probably miss the first half.

- ``「この時計合ってるの？」「合ってるはずだよ。電波時計だもん」``  
  "Is this clock on time?" "It should be. It gets set automatically."

- ``お化けなんてこわくないと言っていたタカシだが、誰もいないはずの２階で物音がした途端、すたこらさっさと逃げ出した。``  
  Takashi said he wasn't afraid of ghosts, but when he heard some sounds from the supposedly empty second floor, he quickly scrambled away.

  I'm fairly sure I'm right about this.
