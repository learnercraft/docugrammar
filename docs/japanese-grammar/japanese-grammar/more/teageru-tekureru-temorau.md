# Verbs + てあげる, てくれる & てもらう

`くれる`, `あげる` and `もらう` are all verbs to do with giving and receiving of things. These verbs can also be combined with other verbs in the [te-form](../verbs/verb-teform) to add nuance to the expression of an action.

## てあげる

`あげる` follows a verb in its te-form when the speaker is performing an action on behalf of others. By creating the てあげる construct, the inherent meaning of a sentence is not changed, rather it becomes more nuanced: it implies that an action is performed as a favour or on the request of someone else. For example:

- ``このペンが欲しいのなら、貸してあげるよ。``  
  If you want this pen, I will lend it to you.

## てくれる

The te-form of a verb + `くれる`, by contrast, is used when another person does something on behalf of the speaker. For example:

- ``彼は私たちに英語を教えてくれる。``  
  He teaches us English.

## てもらう

The te-form of a verb + `もらう` is used when the speaker persuades, gets, or demands that another person do something for them. In te-form + `もらう` sentences, the person who is carrying out the action is marked by the particle `に`. For example:

- ``自分の文を友だちに訳してもらうのが好きだ。``  
  I like it when I get my friends to translate my sentences.

`友達` here is the person carrying out the action, and is marked with the particle `に`.
