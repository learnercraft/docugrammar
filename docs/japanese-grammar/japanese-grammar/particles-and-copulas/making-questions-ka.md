# Making Questions with か

The kana `か` is an exceptionally useful one, and one that can transform even the most mundane statement into a provocative question.

`か` is used to make statements into questions when talking in the polite form. In the plain form, rising intonation fulfils the same function.

While there are plenty of other question words to clarify how, what, where, when and why, `か` is the most basic way to create questions in Japanese.

## Usage

To make questions with `か`, simply take your polite form sentence and put か at the end. It's as easy as that.

- Statement: ``学生です。``  
  I'm a student.

- Question: ``学生ですか。``  
  Are you a student?

- Answer: ``学生じゃありません。``  
  I'm not a student.

Note that in the written Japanese, a question mark does not follow `か` to infer that the sentence is a question. However, if the speaker was to ask a question in plain form, then a question mark would be needed to indicate it was a question rather than a statement in the written form.

`か` is not usually used following a plain form sentence as it makes the sentence sound too direct. The one exceptions is when using the [volitional form](../verbs/verb-volitionalform).

## Example Sentences

- ``眠いですか？``  
  Are you sleepy?

- ``無料なのですか。``  
  Is it free?

- ``趣味は何ですか。``  
  What are your hobbies?

- ``お金が必要ですか？``  
  Do you need any money?

- ``紅茶を一杯いかがですか。``  
  How about a cup of tea?
