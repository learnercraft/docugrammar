# The Particle が

`が` is one of the most important particles in Japanese and is used to mark the subject of a sentence. It is closely related to, and often confused with, the particle `は`, which usually marks the topic of a sentence.

## Using が

### When first introducing a subject

が is used when the subject of a sentence is first introduced. If the subject in subsequent discourse becomes the topic, `が` is replaced with `は`. For example:

- ``部屋にはベッドがあります。ベッドは大きいです。``  
  In my room I have a bed. The bed is big.

In the first sentence, the topic is `部屋` (room) while the subject is the bed. In the second sentence 'bed' becomes the topic and so `が` is replaced with `は`. This is reflected in the English translation in the difference between 'a bed' and 'the bed'.

### Contrasting

`が` is replaced by `は` as the subject marker if the subject is directly contrasting with something else.

- ``寿司は美味しいです。``  
  Sushi is delicious (but other food is not)

### Subordinate Clauses

In subordinate clauses, the subject is marked with `が` unless the subordinate clause is contrasting with some other information, in which case the subject is marked with `は`.

- ``私が昨日見た映画は日本語の映画です。``  
  The movie I saw yesterday was a Japanese movie.

In the above example `私が` is the subordinate clause, while `昨日見た映画` is the topic.

### Following interrogatives

Interrogatives such as `何`, `誰` and `どこ` are never the topic of a sentence and so they are followed by `が`. If the question relates to a direct object, the particle `を` is also used.

- ``何が心配なの？``  
  What are you worrying about?

### Other functions

`が` appears in many other guises, and amongst other things can be used as a conjunction that translates to a weaker version of the english conjunction 'but'.
