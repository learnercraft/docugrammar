# The Particle は

`は` is the particle used to mark the topic of a sentence. In speech, it is used to introduce previously unmentioned topics and to bring up new ideas that might otherwise seem out of context. In the most literal sense, by using `は` you are saying 'we're talking about *this* now'.

Despite being written (confusingly) as the hiragana kana `は`, the particle `は` is pronounced "wa".

## The Difference Between は and が

`は` and `が` have a close relationship, but their usage is different.

While `は` introduces a topic for the first time, `が` is used to identify the subject of the sentence. Identifying something as the topic provides context for a sentence. Identifying something as the subject gives it an inherent grammatical link to the verb.

## Deciding When to Use Each Particle

While there's no foolproof rule as to when you should use each of the two particles, there's a useful trick that can help.

Because `は` is used to mark the topic, a piece of information that is not strictly needed to make a sentence grammatically correct, it can be removed from a sentence altogether. `が` meanwhile, plays a much more essential grammatical role, and it's omissions can create a sentence that makes little to no sense.

Take the following sentence:

> 私 は/が　**ケーキを食べた。**

Now, if you remove everything before `ケーキ`, does the sentence become:

1. vague, conveying core information but omitting context (e.g. as the answer to the question 'what did you do last night?'), or
2. unintelligible and no longer able to convey the information desired (e.g. as the answer to the question 'who ate the cake last night?')

If your answer to the above is 1, then `は` is most likely the particle you want to use. If your answer is 2, then `が` is the particle you're after.

While not all examples are as clear cut as this, this trick can help when trying to work out which particle to use in different situations.

## Avoid 私は Where Possible

If you introduce every sentence with `私は` you are making yourself the topic of the sentence. This can have the effect of making your speech sound much more self-centred than intended. If possible, drop `私は`.
