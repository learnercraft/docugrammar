# The Particle も

The particle `も` has a wide range of uses, but is most commonly used to mean 'also', 'as well', 'too' or 'neither'. This article introduces a few of the uses of `も`.

## Using も for Similarity

If we have two sentences:

1. ``それは犬です。``  
That is a dog
2. ``これは犬です。``  
This is a dog

Instead of using the particle `は` to define the topic in two different sentences, we can link the two sentences using `も`, as follows:

- ``それは犬です、これも犬です。``  
  That is a dog and this is a dog, too.

### Particles with も

In the example above, `は` was simply replaced with `も`. Similarly, If the original particle used was `が`, `が` is also replaced with `も`.

Different rules exist with `で` and `に`. If the original particle was `で` or `に`, `で` and `に` both remain in place, and `も` is added afterwards to create the particles `でも` and `にも`. For example:

- **Person 1**: ``日本で山がたくさんあります。``  
  Japan has lots of mountains.
- **Person 2**: <code>フランス**でも**山がたくさんあります。</code>  
  France also has lots of mountains.  
<br/>
- **Person 1**: ``福岡に行った。``  
  I went to Fukuoka.  
- **Person 2**: ``福岡にも行った。``  
  I also went to Fukuoka.

## Using も to Express Lack of Preference

If you want to say you like both X and Y, or have no particular preference for either, use `も` as follows:

- ``焼肉も焼き鳥も好きです。``  
  I like both Yakiniku and Yakitori.

- ``京都も東京も行きたい。``  
  I want to go to both Tokyo and Kyoto.

## Asking Questions with も

You can use `も` in questions to ask whether someone shares the same characteristic or opinion.

- **Person 1**: ``あなたも猫が好きですか。``  
  *Do you also like cats?*  
- **Person 2**: ``はい、猫が好きです。``  
  *Yes, I like cats.*

## も with Quantity

`も` can also be used with quantities of things to emphasise their size (for better or for worse). For example, if you receive ¥50,000 you could say:

- ``５万円 貰いました。``  
  I received ¥50,000.

However if you want to emphasise this statement, because you believe it to be a large quantity, you can say:

- ``５万円も貰いました。``  
  Wow, I received ¥50,000.

`も` can be used to emphasise both positive and negative, so if something cost you ¥5,000 and you think that it was expensive, you could say:

- ``５千円もかかった。``  
  Boo, it cost ¥5,000.

## も with Interrogative Pronouns

Japanese interrogative pronouns such as `何` `誰`, `どれ` and `どこ` can be combined with `も` to create a whole host of useful words:

|Interrogative Pronoun|+も|
|:--|:--|
|何 (what)|何も (anything/nothing)|
|誰 (who)|誰も (everyone/no one)|
|どれ (which)|どれも (both/neither)|
|どこ (where)|どこも (anywhere/nowhere)|

For example:

- ``誰もがほっとしたようだった。``  
  Everyone looked relieved.

## Using も to mean Not Even

Using the following construct, you can use `も` to mean 'not even'.

:::tip[ ]

ー + counter + も + negative verb

:::

For example, `滴` is used as the counter for a drop of something: 一滴 means one drop. So, to create a sentence in Japanese along the lines of, 'it hasn't rained a drop' you would use `も` as follows:

- ``雨が一滴も降らなかった。``  
  It's not even rained a drop

This construct can be used with any countable unit.

## Example Sentences

- ``私も日本人です。``  
  I'm also Japanese

- ``日本でもお天気がいいです。``  
  The weather in Japan is good too.

- ``彼も同じことを言っていた。``  
  He was saying the same thing too.

- ``その絵が逆さまに掛けられていることに誰も気付かなかった。``  
  Nobody noticed that the picture was hung upside down.

- ``私の町には外国人は一人もいません``  
  There are no people from abroad living in my town.
