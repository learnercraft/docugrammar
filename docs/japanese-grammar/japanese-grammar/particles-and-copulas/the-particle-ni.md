# The Particle に

`に` is one of the most commonly used particles in Japanese and has a wide range of uses including denoting time, location, destination and changes of state. Here we introduce some of the most common uses of the particle `に`.

## Location: に vs で

Both `に` and `で` can be used to talk about location, however, they are used in different contexts. `に` is used when talking about 'the location of being' of something e.g.

- ``福岡に住んでいます``  
  I live in Fukuoka.

で meanwhile is used to talk about the location of doing, combined with action verbs e.g.

- ``福岡で働いています``  
  I work in Fukuoka.

## Change of State

`に` is used in conjunction with the verb `なる` to indicate a change of state in something, e.g. ``医者になります。`` (I will become a doctor.)

## Indirect Objects

`に` usually follows indirect objects, for example:

- ``友達に手紙を書きます。``  
  I write letters to my friends.

- ``彼女は僕にお箸をくれました。``  
  She gave me a pair of chopsticks.

## Direction and Destination: に and へ

When talking about direction and destination, `に` and `へ` are fairly interchangeable.

For example, both `福岡に行きます` and `福岡へいきます` translate to 'I will go to Fukuoka'.

Exceptions to this rule include `お風呂に入る` (to get in a bath) and `電車に乗る` (to board a bus).

In speech `へ` gives greater room for generalisations about direction or destination, while `に` tends to be used more specifically.

## Time

に is used to denote a specific time:

For example:

- ``６時半に起きました。``  
  I got up at 6.30.

- ``２月に福岡へ行きます。``  
  I will go to Fukuoka in February.

- ``2017年に日本語を勉強しました。``  
  In 2017, I studied Japanese.

`に` is not used with the following words: `今日`, `今`, `朝`, `晩`, `いつ`, `毎`, `来`

## Times Per

`に` is also used when donating how many times something is done in a given time, translating to 'per'. For example:

- ``一週間に３回テニスをする。``  
  I play tennis three times a/per week.

## Example Sentences

- ``友達に手紙を書きます。``  
  I write letters to my friends.

- ``６時半に起きました。``  
  I got up at 6.30.

- ``２月に福岡へ行きます。``
