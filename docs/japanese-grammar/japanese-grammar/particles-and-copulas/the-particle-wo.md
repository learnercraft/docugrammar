# The Particle を

`を` is used in combination with direct objects, nouns used to perform an action. `を` serves no other purpose, so if you see or hear it used in a sentence, you can assume that it follows the direct object of the sentence.

Despite being written as the hiragana kana "wo", `を` the particle is pronounced `お`
