# Apologising with すみませんでした

If you would like to apologise for something you have done in the past, then the phrase to use is `すみませんでした`. Understandably, this phrase is in the polite form, to convey that you are actually sorry.

## Apologising for Something You Have Done

When apologising for something you have done, conjugate the verb to its te-form, and then add `すみませんでした`.

## Apologising for Something You Have Failed to Do

If you have failed to do something, conjugate the verb to its nai-form (negative plain form). Cut the last `い` of the nai-form and then add `くて`. Then add `すみませんでした`.

## Other Ways to Say Sorry

If you are making a less formal apology, `ごめんなさい` or `ごめん` can be used instead of `すみませんでした`.

If you want to make a really formal apology, use `申し訳ありませんでした` which translates to 'I'm sincerely sorry; please forgive me'. This apology is not used in casual speech.
