# Making Requests in Japanese Using the Te-Form

It's easy to make requests in Japanese once you know the ``te-form`` by combining verbs in the te-form with the word `下さい`.

For example:

- ``お箸を取って下さい。``  
  Please can you pass me a pair of chopsticks.

Using this format is essentially the same as saying to someone in English, "Please can you ... (for me)?"

## Requests in the Negative

If you would like to request some to refrain from doing something, then you can use the negative variation `ないで下さい`. To use this form, simply conjugate a verb to its [nai-form](../verbs/verb-shortformpresentnegative) and then and `で下さい`. For example:

- ``ここでコーヒーを飲まないで下さい。``  
  Please don't drink coffee here.

## Polite Requests

To take your request up a notch in politeness, you can substitute `下さい` with `いただけませんか`. This is more appropriate when asking something of a stranger or non-peer.

- ``お箸を取っていただけませんか。``  
  Please can you pass me a pair of chopsticks. (polite)

## Alternatives

Equivalent in politeness to `て下さい` is `てくれませんか`. A more casual form of `てくれませんか` is `てくれない`.

- ``お箸を取ってくれませんか。``  
  Please can you pass me a pair of chopsticks.

- ``お箸を取ってくれない。``  
  Please can you pass me a pair of chopsticks. (casual)
