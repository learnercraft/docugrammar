# Using 後で

`後で` translates to 'after' or 'later'. It is used in combination with nouns and verbs to say that something happened after something else.

## 後で with Verbs

`後で` follows verbs in the plain-form, for example:

- ``焼酎を飲んだ後で、一時間ほど寝ました。``  
  After I drank the shochu, I fell asleep for an hour.

## 後で with Nouns

When `後で` follows a noun, the particle `の` is placed between the noun and `後で`. For example:

- ``昼ごはんの後で友達とコヒーを飲んだ。``  
  After lunch, I had a coffee with my friends.

## Difference between 後で and てから

`後で` and `てから` are fairly interchangeable, but are subtly different. `てから` implies the action that follows is more dependant on the completion of action that precedes it and suggests a closer relationship in terms of time. `後で` is more applicable when a length of time occurs between activity 1 and activity 2.

## Example Sentences

- ``プールで泳いだ後でスッキリした気分になった。``  
  I felt refreshed after a swim in the pool.

- ``ねえ、後でアイス食べよう。``  
  Hey, let's eat some ice cream afterwards.

- ``列車に乗車した後で、私は財布を家に置き忘れてきたことに気が付いた。``  
  After I got on board a train, I found I had left my wallet behind at home.

- ``昼ごはんの後で友達とコヒーを飲んだ。``  
  After lunch, I had a coffee with my friends.
