# When: 時

In Japanese, the word `とき (時)` is used to describe when something happens, for example:

- 子供時たくさん甘いものを食べた。(When I was a child, I ate lots of sweets.)

`時` is used as follows:

- Sentence A (time reference) + 時 + Sentence B (event)

Sentence A always ends in the short form, whether it is in the past or present, positive or negative. However, whether Sentence A is in the past or present can significantly influence the meaning of a `時` sentence.

## The different meanings of 時

If Sentence A expresses an action, the meaning of the sentence changes depending on what tense Sentence A and Sentence B are in.

If the verb in Sentence A and Sentence B takes place at the same time:

- ``福岡へ行く時新幹線で行く。``  
  When I go to Fukuoka, I go by bullet train.

- ``福岡へ行く時新幹線で行った。``  
  When I went to Fukuoka, I went by bullet train.

- ``福岡へ行った時新幹線で行った。``  
  When I went to Fukuoka, I went by bullet train.

If the verb in Sentence A is a verb of movement (行く, 来る, 帰る,):

- ``福岡へ行く時ラーメンを食べるつもりだ。``  
  Before I leave for Fukuoka, I will eat ramen.

- ``福岡へ行った時ラーメンを食べるつもりだ。``  
  When I arrive in Fukuoka, I will eat ramen.

- ``福岡へ行く時ラーメンを食べ た。``  
  I ate ramen before I left for Fukuoka.

- ``福岡へ行く時ラーメンを食べるつもりだ。``  
  I ate ramen after I arrived in Fukuoka.

If the verb in Sentence A is not a verb of movement:

- ``コーヒーを飲む時シャワーを浴びる。``  
  I will take a shower just before I eat my meal.

- ``コーヒーを飲んだ時シャワーを浴びる。``  
  I will take a shower straight after I eat my meal.

- ``コーヒーを飲む時シャワーを浴びた。``  
  I took a shower just before I eat my meal.

- ``コーヒーを飲んだ時シャワーを浴びた。``  
  I took a shower just after I eat my meal.

## Notes

- 時 sentences are not used to express conditionality, instead the tara-form conditional is used to create conditional when sentences. Read more about the tara-form, here.
- If the subject of Sentence A is different to the subject of the entire sentence, `は` is replaced with `が`, for example.

- ``トミさんは私が日本語を勉強した時ビールを飲んだ。``  
  Tommy was drinking a beer when I was studying Japanese.

- If a na-adjective precedes `時`, `だ` is replaced with `な`. Similarly if a noun precedes `時`, だ is replaced with `の`.
- The particle に can be added after 時 to emphasise the time aspect of the sentence.

> 子供の時にお菓子がたくさん食べた。]()  
> *It was when* I was a child, that I ate lots of sweets.
