# The Negative Imperative

This form is for giving commands in the negative, allowing you to make sentences such as 'don't do that'. It is considered very direct in Japanese speech.

## Conjugation

Conjugation is extremely simple for these verbs, and the same rule applies for u-verbs and ru-verbs. There are no irregular verbs in the negative imperative.

Simply take the dictionary form of the verb and add `な`.
