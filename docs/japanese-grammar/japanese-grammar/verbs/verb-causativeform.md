# The Causative Form

The causative form is used to describe when someone or something has made something happen or, as the name suggests, causes something to happen.

## Using the Causative Form

Sentences in the causative form usually need a causer, an actor and an action.

Take the following sentence:  

- ``お母さんは子供に果物を食べさせました。``  
  The mother made the child eat the fruit.

The causer (`お母さん`) is marked by the particle `は` or `が`, the actor (子供) is marked by the particle `に` and the verb is conjugated to the causative form.

## Conjugation the Causative Form

### U-Verbs

For u-verbs that end in the kana `う`, take the dictionary form, remove the `う`, replace it with `わ` and then add `せる`.

| Dictionary Form | Causative Form |
|:--|:--|
|``買う``|買わせる|

For all other u-verbs, replace the u-vowel sound with the a-vowel equivalent and then attach `せる`.

| Dictionary Form | Causative Form |
|:--|:--|
|``待つ``|待たせる|
|``飲む``|飲ませる|
|``泳ぐ``|泳がせる|
|``行く``|行かせる|  

You may have noticed the first steps of conjugating the causative form follow the same pattern as conjugating the [nai-form](verb-shortformpresentnegative). Only the final step is different, adding `せる` instead of `ない`.

### Ru-Verbs

For ru-verbs, take the dictionary form, cut the `る` and add `させる`.

|Dictionary Form | Causative Form |
|:--|:--|
|``食べる``|食べさせる|
|``見る``|見させる|
|``覚える``|覚えさせる|

### Irregular

|Dictionary Form | Causative Form |
|:--|:--|
|``する``|させる|
|``くる``|こさせる|

Each of these verbs in the causative form are effectively new verbs in the ru-form and can be conjugated further to the te-form, masu-form etc.

## Example Sentences

- ``アレルギーがあるのに私が子どもに卵を食べさせてしまった。``  
  Even though she's allergic, I gave an egg to the child.

- ``私が友達に宿題をチェックさせた。``  
  I had my friend check my homework.

- ``飲食代を払わせる。``  
  To make a person pay for food.

- ``待たせてごめんなさい。``  
  Sorry I made you wait.
