# The Masu-Form

The masu-form is the polite, non-past affirmative form of a verb.

It is considered polite in general conversation, so using the masu-form it is your best bet if you're uncertain how to address someone in Japanese or when talking to strangers, new acquaintances and superiors.

If you do not know the masu-form of a verb but know the dictionary form, then check out [this article](plain-form-masu-form) on how to conjugate from the plain form to the masu-form.

## The Polite Form

The basic conjugations of the polite form are:

||Affirmative|Negative|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Non-past|verb + ます|verb + ません|
|Past|verb + ました|verb + ませんでした|

As you can see, there are only two tenses to learn in the above table. Non-past (i.e. present & future) and past.

Unlike English and most romantic languages, Japanese verbs do not conjugate based on their subject and remain unaffected whether 'I', 'you', 'he', 'she' or 'they' is the subject.
