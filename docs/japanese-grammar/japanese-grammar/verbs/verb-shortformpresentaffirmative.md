# The Dictionary Form

The dictionary form is the most basic form of a Japanese verb. It is also the non-past, affirmative conjugation of plain speech.

Uses of the dictionary form include quoting people, saying you like doing something or saying you're good at something.

## Uses of the Dictionary Form

### Casual Conversation/Plain Speech

When close friends, colleagues, family etc. are talking to one another, they will most frequently use plain speech (as opposed to more formal language when talking to strangers, superiors or new acquaintances). In this case, the dictionary form is used as the present and future affirmative form of the verb.
