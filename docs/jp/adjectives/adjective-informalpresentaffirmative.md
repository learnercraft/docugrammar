# Adjectives: The Plain Form Non-past Affirmative

## I-Adjectives

The plain, non-past affirmative of an i-adjective is an i-adjective at its most basic. No copulas, no conjugations, simply the adjective in its plain form.

### Common Plain Form, Non-Past Affirmative I-Adjectives

- ``暖かい``  
  It is warm

- ``新しい``  
  It is new

- ``面白い``  
  It is interesting/funny

## Na-Adjectives

The plain, non-past affirmative of a na-adjective is similarly simple, and follows the same conjugation rules as nouns. To conjugate the adjective properly at the end of a sentence, add だ.

If using the plain, non-past affirmative of a na-adjective to modify a noun, put `な` between the na-adjective and the noun, e.g. `きれいな人`.

### Common Plain Form, Non-Past Affirmative Na-Adjectives

- ``好きだ``  
  I like it.

- ``有名だ``  
  It is famous.

- ``きれいだ``  
  It is beautiful/clean.
