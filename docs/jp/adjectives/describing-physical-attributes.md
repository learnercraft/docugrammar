# Describing Physical Attributes

In English, it's natural to describe someone's physical attributes as follows:

- Oscar's eyes are blue.
- Alice's hair is blonde.
- Tommy's waistline is expanding.

Following a similar logic in Japanese you would create sentences such as:

- オスカーさんの目は青いです。- Oscar's eyes are blue.

Where *Oscar's eyes* are the topic and they are described as blue.

However in Japanese, this sentence sounds unnatural. A more natural sentence would read:

- ``オスカーさんは目が青いです。`` - Oscar's eyes are blue.

Where *Oscar* is the topic, and his eyes are described as blue. This pattern is used when describing any other physical attribute of a person in Japanese.
