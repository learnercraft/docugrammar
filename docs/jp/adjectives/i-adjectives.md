# I-Adjectives

As the name might suggest, all i-adjectives end with the kana `い`. I-adjectives are one of two main groups of adjectives, the other group being [na-adjectives](adjective-naform).  

There are a few na-adjectives that also end with `い`, `きれい` being the most common example. So how do you tell the difference between the two?

The easiest way is to delve into the kanji. When `きれい` is written in kanji `綺麗` the `い` is included in the second kanji, and is not modifiable. I-adjectives will always end with a modifiable hiragana `い`. Take a look at the list below.

## Common I-Adjectives

- ``おいしい``  
  Delicious

- ``高い``  
  High/expensive

- ``いい``  
  Good

- ``悪い``  
  Bad

## Conjugating I-Adjectives

- Negative: Remove the `い` and add `くない`.
- Past-affirmative: Remove the `い` and add `かった`.
- Past-negative: Remove the `い` and add `くなかった`.

||Affirmative|Negative|
|:-- |:--|:--|
|Present|高い|高くない|
|Past|高かった|高くなかった|

### An Exceptional I-Adjective

There's one i-adjective that spoils the party: `いい`. The word `いい` was originally written as `よい` and hangs on to aspects of its past-self. When conjugating `いい` into the past tense, or making it negative, you must conjugate from `よい`.

||Affirmative|Negative|
|:-- |:--|:--|
|Present|いい|よくない.|
|Past|よかった|よくなかった|

## Modifying Nouns

To modify nouns with i-adjectives, you must conjugate the adjective first:

- ``高い山です。``  
  It is a tall mountain.

- ``高くない山です。``  
  It is not a tall mountain.

- ``高かった山です。``  
  It was a tall mountain.

- ``高くなかった山です。``  
  It was not a tall mountain.
