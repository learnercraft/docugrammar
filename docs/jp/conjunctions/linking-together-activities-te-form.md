# Linking Together Two (or more) Activities Using the Te-Form

## Sequential Linking

To describe a sequence of events (I did this, then I did that and then I did this other thing), you can use the te-form.

When constructing a sentence like this, the final verb is conjugated to provide the tense of the sentence, leaving you hanging in tense-less suspense until the very end.

## Examples

- ``テニスをして、映画を見て、日本酒を飲んだ。``  
  I played tennis, watched a film and then drank *sake*.

- ``テニスをして、映画を見て、日本酒を飲む。``  
  I will play tennis, watch a film and then drink *sake*.

## Indirect Linkage

In the examples above, the te-form is used to mean I did this, then I did that, in an ordered list of the events that took place in your day.

However, the te-form can also be used to link verbs/sentences more indirectly.

In English, this would be the difference between saying 'I take the train. I go to work' and 'I take the train to work'. Learning this use of the te-form will help you to speak Japanese in a more fluid and eloquent way.

- ``電車に乗って、会社に行きます``  
  I caught the train to work.

## Example Sentences

- ``笑って、泣いて、感動した映画``  
  A movie that makes you laugh, cry and is impressive.

- ``カラオケに行って、ストレス発散しよう。``  
  Let's go to karaoke to release stress.
