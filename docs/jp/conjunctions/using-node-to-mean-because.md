# Using ので to mean "because"

`ので` is used almost identically to `から` to link two sentences. However, in speech, it is more formal than `から`.

`ので` can be used to link two sentences together. Take the example below:

- ``雨が降るので, 明日テニスをすることができません。``  
  Because it will rain, we can't play tennis tomorrow.

`ので` follows verbs in the polite form. If `ので` follows a na-adjective or a noun, `な` comes between the adjective and `ので`, e.g.

- ``今日は誕生日なので、ケーキを食べたいです。``  
  Because today is my birthday, I want to eat cake.

## Example Sentences

- ``危険ですのでエスカレーターで歩かないでください。``  
  Because it is dangerous, please do not walk on the escalator.

- ``他のお客様のご迷惑になりますので携帯電話での通話はご遠慮ください。``  
  Because it troubles other customers, please do not talk on the phone.

- ``今日は良い天気なので、ピクニックに行きませんか？``  
  Because it's sunny today, why don't we go for a picnic?
