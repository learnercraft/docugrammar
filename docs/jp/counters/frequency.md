# Frequency

It's easy to express frequency in Japanese using the following construct:

> Period に frequency

Period is the length of time you're talking about e.g a week, a month, a year. Frequency is the number of times you perform that action in that period.

Frequency is marked by the counter `回`.

A complete sentence would look something like this:

- ``一週間に二回テニスをします。``  
  I play tennis three times a week.

Where `一週間` is the period and `二回` the frequency.

- ``兄は一月に三回福岡に行きます。``  
  My older brother goes to Fukuoka three times a month.

## Interrogative

If you want to ask questions about frequency, the interrogative is `何回`, for example:

- ``一週間に何回テニスをします。``  
  How many times do you play tennis a week?

## Example Sentences

- ``１日に３回、この薬を服用しなさい。``  
  Take the medicine three times a day.

- ``月に３、４回映画を見に行く``  
  I go to the movies three or four times a month.

- ``そこには何回行ったの？``  
  How many times have you gone?

- ``姉は週に2回ピアノのレッスンを受けている。``  
  My sister takes piano lessons twice a week.
