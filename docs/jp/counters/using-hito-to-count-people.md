# Using 人 to Count People

When counting people, you do so with the counter `人`. Counting people is pretty easy but there are two irregular counters you must remember. See the table below:

|Japanese|English|  
|:--|:--|
|``一人``|one person|
|``二人``|two people|
|``三人``|three people|
|``四人``|four people|
|``五人``|five people|
|``六人``|six people|
|``七人``|seven people|
|``八人``|eight people|
|``九人``|nine people|
|``十人``|ten people|
|``五十人``|fifty people|
|``百人``|one hundred people|

## Asking How Many People

If you want to ask how many people there are, you would use the question `何人ですか。`

However, the most likely time you're going to be asked 'how many people?' in Japan will be in a restaurant. Because they are serving customers and being extra polite, they won't use `何人ですか`, instead you'll hear `何名様ですか`.

## Saying How Many People

If you want to say how many people, take the counter e.g. `一人` and add the verb `います`, e.g `三人います`
