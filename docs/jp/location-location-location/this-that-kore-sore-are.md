# This Thing, That thing with これ, それ & あれ

In English, when talking about unnamed things - either because we don't know the word for that thing, or because it is deliberately omitted - we use the words 'this' and 'that'.

In Japanese, the same is achieved with the words `これ`, `それ` and `あれ`.

The difference between the words comes down to the positioning of the object relative to the speaker and listener.

## Usage

- ``これ`` - used when talking about a thing near to the speaker, in the same way that you would use 'this' in English.
- ``それ`` - used when talking about something that is closer to the listener than to the speaker, equivalent to 'that'.
- ``あれ`` - used when talking about something that is close to neither the speaker nor the listener, again equivalent to the English word 'that'.
- ``どれ`` - an interrogative meaning which, for example `どれですか。` (Which one?). Used as a sentence beginning interrogative, `どれ` must be followed by `が`.

## Example Sentences

  What is this?
