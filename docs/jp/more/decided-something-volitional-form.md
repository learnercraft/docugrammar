# Say What You've Decided To Do Something with the Volitional-Form

In this lesson, you'll learn how to use the [volitional form](../verbs/verb-volitionalform) with the verb `思う` to say that you've decided to do something.

## Volitional + と思っています

Using this construct allows you to say what you've decided to do. To create it, conjugate the verb into its volitional form and then add `と思っています`. For example:

- ``毎日ヨガをしようと思っています。``  
  I've decided to do yoga every day.

`います` at the end of `思っています` is the polite form of the ru-verb `いる` and can be conjugated further as needed.

## Volitional + と思います

Maybe you haven't decided the right course of action yet. But you're put on the spot game show style, and you have making a decision in the moment.

In this case you want to use the volitional and `と思います` to express your split second decision, For example:

- ``もっと運動しようと思います。``  
  I'm going to get more exercise.

The differences between `と思っています` and `と思います` are only slight, but basically come down to how much prior thought you've put into the thing you've decided to do.

### Example Sentences

- ``毎日ヨガをしようと思っています。``  
  I've decided to do yoga every day.

- ``頭がよくなりたいから、毎晩本を読もうと思っています。``  
  Because I want to be smart, I've decided to read a book every evening.

- ``彼女と結婚したいと思っています。``  
  I hope to marry her.

- ``もっと運動しようと思います。``  
  I'm going to get more exercise.

- ``仕事を中止しようと思います。``  
  I intend to stop the work.
