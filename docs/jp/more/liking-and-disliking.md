# Liking and Disliking

Two of the most important na-adjectives in the Japanese language are ``好き`` and ``きらい``, meaning like and dislike respectively.

Counter to what you might expect, the words 'like' and 'dislike' in Japanese are adjectives, and not verbs as they are in English.

## Using 好き and きらい

The basic format of a sentence using `好き` or `きらい` is this:

> **Topic** は **Subject** が　**好き/きらい** です。

For example:

- ``オスカーさんは寿司が好きです。``  
  Oscar likes sushi.

- ``ベンさんは焼酎がきらいです。``  
  Ben dislikes shochu

If you use `好き` when talking about another person, be careful, as in Japanese, it is often taken to mean that you have some form of romantic interest in that person. You know, 'I *like* like you'.

`好き` and `きらい` can also be paired with nouns to create 'liked' or 'disliked' things:

- ``好きな音楽``  
  liked music

- ``きらいな食べ物``  
  disliked foods

If you really want to emphasise what you like or dislike, you can combine ``好き`` and ``きらい`` with ``大`` to create the words ``大好き`` and ``大きらい``. These are also na-adjectives.

## Example Sentences

- ``好きでもきらいでもありません。``  
  I neither like it nor dislike it.

- ``彼女はオレンジが好きですか。``  
  Does she like oranges?

- ``太陽が大好きです。``  
  I like the sun.

- ``自分の文を友だちに訳してもらうのが好きだ。``  
  I like when my friends translate my sentences.

- ``猫は水が嫌いです。``  
  Cats don't like water.

- ``私は本当に乳製品が大嫌いです``  
  I really hate dairy products.

- ``嫌いな飲み物は何ですか。``  
  Which drinks don't you like?
