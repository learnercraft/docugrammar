# Saying 'I Want' with ほしい

``欲しい`` is an i-adjective that means to want (an object). The basic sentence construction using `欲しい` is:

> **X** が **欲しい**

In positive sentences, the particle following 'X' is usually が, though in negative sentences (`欲しくない`) the particle `は` is also used.

## It's Personal

In the same way that the tai-form is usually used only to talk about one's own desires or wants, `欲しい` is generally reserved for personal use.

If you want to talk about someone else's desires, you must either quote them or, as with the tai-form, use the special construct `たがっています`.
