# The Particle と

The particle `と` has several uses in Japanese, from acting as a conjunction to allowing comparisons and contrasts to be made. This article introduces some of the uses of this crucial particle.

## Connecting nouns with と

When connecting two nouns in a sentence, `と` most commonly translates to 'and'.

However, in this context `と` cannot be used as widely as the English 'and': it cannot be used to connect phrases or clauses within a sentence.

But, if you want to say something like 'I like Japanese food and Italian food', you'd be correct to use `と`

- ``日本の料理とイタリアの料理が好きです。``  
  I like Japanese food and Italian food.

## Using と to mean with

If you went somewhere, or are doing something with another person, you can express this by using the particle `と`. For example:

- ``友達と買い物に行く。``  
  I will go shopping with my friend.

In this context `と` always follows the noun you're doing something with; the syntax is opposite to the English.

## Using と to compare and contrast

When comparing and contrasting, you use the particle `と` after each of things you are comparing, for example:

- ``ピアノとギターと、どちらの方が好きですか。``  
  Which do you prefer: piano or guitar?

## Using と to mark quotation

`と` is used to mark a quotation or thought, for example:

- ``彼は「愛してる？」と言いました。``  
  He asked, "Do you love me?"
