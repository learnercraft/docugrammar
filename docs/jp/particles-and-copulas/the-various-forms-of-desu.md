# The Various Forms of です

## What's the Meaning of です

`です` is a what is known as a copula, and roughly translates to 'to be'.

However, this translation is far from perfect, and as you learn Japanese you'll quickly come across circumstances where 'to be' would be appropriate in English, but verbs other than  です`are used in Japanese (`いる` and `ある` are chief amongst these).

The copula conjugates to many different forms depending on the politeness of the language used.
`です` and its various forms act as predicate verbs or as substitutes for other verb when the meaning is clear from context.

The various forms of the copula `です` can be seen in the table below:

||Plain|Polite|Very Polite|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Present|だ|です|でございます|
|Negative|ではない|ではありません|で(は)ございます|
|Past|だった|でした|でございました|
|Negative Past|で(は)なかった|で(は)ありませんでした|で(は)ございませんでした|
|Presumptive|だろう|でしょう|でございましょう|
|Conditional|なる/なったら|でしたら|でございましたら|

Note: `ではありません` is commonly contracted to `じゃありません`. `じゃありません` is *slightly* less formal, but the difference between the two is negligible. Similarly, `ではない` is frequently contracted to `じゃない`.
