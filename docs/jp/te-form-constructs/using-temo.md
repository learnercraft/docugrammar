### I-Adjectives

||Negative Plain Form|くても|

## Using ても

Take the following sentence:

- ``雨が降っても、テニスをする。``  
  I will play tennis even if it rains.

The above sentence is comprised of two halves `雨が降る` and `テニスをする`. `ても` is used to link the two to mean 'I will play tennis even if it rains'. `ても` always follows the conditional part of the sentence. An English translation closer to the Japanese structure would be 'Even if it rains, I will play tennis.'
