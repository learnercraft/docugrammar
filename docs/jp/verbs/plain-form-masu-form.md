# Going from the Plain Form to the Masu-Form on the Fly

Though most Japanese students will encounter the masu-form before the plain-form (it is simpler to learn), there will come a time in your Japanese life where you will encounter a verb in the plain form and wonder how you turn it into the masu-form. Here's how:

## U-verbs (Group I)

To change a u-verb from the plain form to the polite form, first create the verb stem by changing the う-sound *kana* into its い-sound equivalent (`う → い`, `く → き`, `つ → ち`, `す → し`, etc.) Then add `ます`.

|Dictionary Form|Masu-Form|
|:--|:--|
|``書く``|書きます|
|``読む``|読みます|
|``泳ぐ``|泳ぎます|
|``話す``|話ます|
|``待つ``|待ちます|

## Ru-verbs (Group II)

For ru-verbs, conjugation is even simpler. Simply take off the final `る` and add `ます`.

|Dictionary Form|Masu-Form|
|:--|:--|
|``食べる``|食べます|
|``あげる``|あげます|
|``疲れる``|疲れます|
|``調べる``|調べます|

## Irregular Verbs (Group III)

No rules here, just the two old irregular verbs to learn.

|Dictionary Form|Masu-Form|
|:--|:--|
|``する``|します|
|``くる``|きます|

Once you've got these rules down, you'll be able to flip any verb from its dictionary-form to its masu-form. You can then conjugate further into the negative, past affirmative and past negative forms of the masu-form.

The above examples all use verb stems. Learn more about [verb stems](verb-iform), here.
