# The Conditional と

`と` can be used a conditional conjunction, equivalent to the word 'if'. It is used when a condition brings about a non-controllable event or state.

## Using と

`と` follows a clause in its nonpast tense. The tense of the entire sentence is provided by the clause following `と`. For example:

- ``福岡に行くと美味しいラーメン屋がたくさんある。``  
  If you go to Fukuoka, there are many delicious ramen shops.

The verb that precedes `と` can either be in the positive or the negative.

- ``雪が降らないと、スキーができません。``  
  If there is no snow, you cannot ski.

Expressions used in the clause following `と` are natural and predictable events/states or unavoidable facts. Hence, the conditional `と` is often used to describe events of nature, the usage of machines and to give directions.

## When not to use と

As stated before, と precedes are natural and predictable events/states or unavoidable facts. This means that the clause following `と` should not  be an expressions of one's will, hope, judgement, permission, order, invitation or a request. The following, for example, would be incorrect:

- ``アルバイトが終わるとアパートに来てください。``  
  If you finish your part time job early, please come to my apartment.

## Example Sentences

- ``まっすぐ行くと、左に郵便局があります。``  
  If you go straight, the post office will be on the left.

- ``このボタンを押すと、100円のお菓子が出ます。``  
  If you press this button, a ¥100 sweet will come out.

- ``何も食べないと、痩せます。``  
  If you don't eat anything, you'll become thin.

- ``２０歳以上だと、日本ではお酒が飲めます。``  
  If you are older than 20, you can drink alcohol in Japan.
