# Verb Stems

Japanese verb stems have all sorts of uses. They are a stepping stone between plain and polite speech, they are used to link verbs together to create new constructs, and can even be combined with verbs to create new verb compounds.

## Conjugation

Conjugating the verb stem from the dictionary form is not difficult, but requires you learn the following rules:

### U-verbs (Group I)

To change a u-verb from the plain form to the polite form, change the う-sound *kana* into its い-sound equivalent (`う → い`, `く → き`, `つ → ち`, `す → し`, etc.)

|Dictionary Form|Stem|
|:--|:--|
|``行く``|行き|
|``思う``|思い|
|``歌う``|歌い|
|``歩く``|歩き|

### Ru-verbs (Group II)

To create the stem of ru-verbs, simply remove the `る`.

|Dictionary Form | Stem |
|:--|:--|
|``食べる``|食べ|
|``見る``| 見|
|``覚える``|覚え|

### Irregular Verbs (Group III)

|Dictionary Form|Stem|
|:--|:--|
|``する``|し|
|``くる``|き|

## A Shortcut

If you already know a verb in its masu-form, simply remove the `ます` and hey presto, you've got the verb stem.

|Masu-form|Stem|
|:--|:--|
|``行きます``|行き|
|``食べます``|食べ |
|``します``|し|
