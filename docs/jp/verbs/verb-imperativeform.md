# The Imperative Form

The imperative form is used to give commands. No messing about with pleasantries, it's for getting straight to the point.

Take care who you're using the imperative form with in Japanese as it is considered very direct and can feel rude if used in the wrong context.

## Conjugating the Imperative Form

### U-Verbs (Group I)

To change a u-verb from its dictionary form to its imperative form, change the う-sound kana into its え-sound equivalent.

|Dictionary Form | Imperative Form |
|:--|:--|
|``歩く``|歩け|
|``急ぐ``|急げ|
|``買う``|買え|
|``勝つ``|勝て|

### Ru-Verbs (Group II)

The rule is simple, take the dictionary form and replace the `る` with `ろ` to create the imperative.

|Dictionary Form | Imperative Form |
|:--|:--|
|``食べる``|食べろ|
|``閉める``|閉めろ|

### Irregular Verbs (Group III)

As well as the usual suspects, `くれる` is also an irregular verb in the imperative form.

|Dictionary Form | Imperative Form |
|:--|:--|
|``する``|しろ|
|``くる``|こい|
|``くれる``|くれ|
