# Adjectives after nouns and pronouns

Adjectives come immediately after nouns in a few special cases.

## Fixed phrases: *Secretary General*; *court martial*

Adjectives come after nouns in some fixed phrases.

- *Secretary **General***
- *court **martial*** (= military court)
- *Poet **Laureate***
- *President **elect***
- *God **Almighty**!*
- *Attorney **General***

## *available*, *possible*, etc

Some adjectives can be used after nouns in a similar way to relative clauses. This is common with adjectives ending in *\-able/-ible*.

- *Send all the **tickets available** / available tickets.* (= … tickets which are available.)
- *It’s the only **solution possible** / possible solution.*

Some adverbs can also be used like this.

- *the woman **upstairs***
- *the people **outside***

## *present*, *proper*

Before a noun, *present* refers to time; after a noun it means ‘here/there’, ‘not absent’. Compare:

- *the **present members*** (= those who are members now)
- *the **members present*** (= those who are/were at the meeting)

Before a noun, *proper* (especially in British English) means ‘real’, ‘genuine’. After a noun it refers to the central or main part of something. Compare:

- *Snowdon’s a **proper mountain**, not a hill.*
- *After two days crossing the foothills, they reached the **mountain proper**.*

## Expressions of measurement: *two metres high*

Adjectives usually follow measurement nouns.

- *two metres **high***
- *ten years **older***
- *two miles **long***
- *six feet **deep***

Exception: *worth* (e.g. ***worth** 100 euros*). [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/worth)

## Adjectives with complements: *people skilled in design*

When an adjective has its own complement (e.g. *skilled in design*), the whole expression normally comes after a noun.

- *We are looking for **people skilled in design**.* (not *~~… skilled in design people.~~*)

A relative clause is often more natural.

- *We are looking for **people who are skilled in design**.*

In some cases an adjective can be put before a noun and its complement after it. This happens with *different*, *similar*, *the same*, *next*, *last*, *first*, *second*, etc; comparatives and superlatives; and a few other adjectives like *difficult* and *easy*.

- *a **different** life **from this one***
- *the **next** house **to the Royal Hotel*** (or the house next to the Royal Hotel)
- *the **second** train **from this platform***
- *the **best** mother **in the world***
- *a **difficult** problem **to solve***

## *something*, *everything*, etc

Adjectives come after *something*, *everything*, *anything*, *nothing*, *somebody*, *anywhere* and similar words.

- *Have you read **anything interesting** lately?*
- *Let’s go **somewhere quiet**.*
