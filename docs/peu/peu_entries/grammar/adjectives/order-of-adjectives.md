# Order of adjectives

When several adjectives come before a noun (or when nouns are used as modifiers before another noun), they are usually put in a more or less fixed order. However, this is a complicated grammatical area, and it is not possible to give simple reliable rules for adjective order. The following guidelines will help.

## Description before classification: *an old political idea*

Words which describe come before words which classify (say what type of thing we are talking about).

|  | description | classification | noun |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *an* | *old* | *political* | *idea* | (not *~~a political old idea~~*) |
| *the* | *latest* | *educational* | *reform* | (not *~~the educational latest reform~~*) |
| *a* | *green* | *wine* | *bottle* | (not *~~a wine green bottle~~*) |
|  | *leather* | *dancing* | *shoes* | (not *~~dancing leather shoes~~*) |

## Opinion before description: *a wonderful old house*

Words which express opinions, attitudes and judgements usually come before words that simply describe. Examples are *lovely*, *definite*, *pure*, *absolute*, *extreme*, *perfect*, *wonderful*, *silly*.

|   | opinion | description | noun |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *a* | *lovely* | *cool* | *drink* | (not *~~a cool lovely drink~~*) |
| *a* | *wonderful* | *old* | *house* | (not *~~an old wonderful house~~*) |
|  | *beautiful* | *green* | *mountains* | (not *~~green beautiful mountains~~*) |
| *that* | *silly* | *fat* | *cat* | (not *~~that fat silly cat~~*) |

## Order of descriptive words

The order of descriptive words is not completely fixed. Words for origin and material usually come last. Words for size, age, shape and colour often come in that order.

|   | size | age | shape | colour | origin | material | noun |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *a* | *fat* | *old* |   | *white* |   |   | *horse* |
| *a* | *big* |   |   | *grey* |   | *woollen* | *sweater* |
|   |   | *new* |   |   | *Italian* |   | *boots* |
| *a* | *small* |   | *round* | *black* |   | *leather* | *handbag* |
| *an* | *enormous* |   |   | *brown* | *German* | *glass* | *mug* |
| *a* | *little* | *modern* | *square* |   |   | *brick* | *house* |

## Numbers

Numbers usually go before adjectives.

- ***six large** eggs*
- *the **second big** shock*

*First*, *next* and *last* most often go before *one*, *two*, *three*, etc.

- *the **first three** days* (More common than *the three first days*)
- *my **last two** jobs*

## Noun modifiers after adjectives

Note that noun modifiers (which often classify, or refer to material) usually follow adjectives.

- *a big new **car** factory*
- *enormous black **iron** gates*

## Commas

Before nouns, we generally use commas between adjectives (especially in longer sequences) which give similar kinds of information, as in physical descriptions.

- *a steep, slippery, grassy slope*
- *an expensive, ill-planned, wasteful project*

But commas can be dropped before short common adjectives.

- *a tall(,) dark(,) handsome cowboy*

We do not use commas between adjectives which give different kinds of information.

- *an attractive traditional woollen dress*

Commas are not used after numbers or other determiners.

- *ten green bottles* (not *~~ten, green bottles~~*)
- *these new ideas* (not *~~these, new ideas~~*)

## After a verb

The order of adjectives in predicative position (after *be*, *seem* and similar verbs, [(see here)](./../verbs/linking-verbs-be-seem-look-etc) is similar to the order before nouns. Note that noun modifiers are not used in this position.

- *a big, green wine bottle* but not *~~The bottle is big, green and wine.~~*
