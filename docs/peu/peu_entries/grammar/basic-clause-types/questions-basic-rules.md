# Questions: basic rules

These rules apply to most ordinary spoken and written questions. For declarative questions (e.g. *This is your car?*), [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/declarative-questions-that-s-the-boss). For rhetorical questions (e.g. *What’s the use of asking her?*), [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/rhetorical-questions-who-cares). For echo questions (e.g. *She’s invited how many?*), [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/echo-questions-she-s-invited-how-many). For reply questions (e.g. *Did you, dear?*), [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/reply-questions-was-it-did-you-dear) For question tags, [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/question-tags-basic-information).

## Auxiliary verb before subject: *Have you …*?

In a question, an auxiliary verb normally comes before the subject.

- *When **is Oliver** leaving?* (not *~~When Oliver is leaving?~~*)
- ***Have you** received my email of June 17?* (not *~~You have received …?~~*)
- *Why **are you** laughing?* (not *~~Why you are laughing?~~*)
- *What **are all those people** looking at?* (not *~~What all those people are looking at?~~*)
- *How much **does the room** cost?* (not *~~How much the room costs?~~*)

## *do*: *Do you like …?*

If there is no other auxiliary verb, we use *do*, *does* or *did* to form a question.

- ***Do** you like Mozart?* (not *~~Like you Mozart?~~*)
- *What **does** ‘periphrastic’ mean?* (not *~~What means ‘periphrastic’?~~*)
- ***Did** you wash the car today?*

## *do* not used with other auxiliaries

*Do* is not used together with other auxiliary verbs or with *be*.

- ***Can you** tell me the time?* (not *~~Do you can tell me the time?~~*)
- ***Have you** seen Jack?* (not *~~Do you have seen Jack?~~*)
- ***Are you** ready?*

## Infinitive after *do*: *What does he want?*

After *do*, we use the infinitive (without *to*).

- *What does the boss **want?*** (not *~~What does the boss wants?~~*)
- *Did you **go** climbing last weekend? (not *~~Did you went …?~~*) or *~~Did you to go …?~~**

## Only auxiliary verb before subject

Only the auxiliary verb goes before the subject, not the whole of the verb phrase.

- ***Is** your mother **coming** tomorrow?* (not *~~Is coming your mother tomorrow?~~*)
- ***Is** your daughter **having** a lesson today?* (not *~~Is having your daughter …?~~*)
- *When **was** your reservation **made**?* (not *~~When was made your reservation?~~*)

This happens even if the subject is very long.

- *Where are **the President and his family** staying?* (not *~~Where are staying the President …?~~*)

## *Who phoned? / Who did you phone?*

When *who*, *which*, *what* or *whose* is the subject (or part of the subject), *do* is not normally used. Compare:

- *Who **phoned?** (*Who* is the subject.)*  
  *Who **did** you **phone?*** (*Who* is the object.)
- *What **happened?** (*What* is the subject.)*  
  *What **did** she **say?*** (*What* is the object.)

More examples:

- *Which **costs** more – the blue one or the grey one?* (not *~~Which does cost more …?~~*)
- *Which type of battery **lasts** longest?* (not *~~Which type of battery does last longest?~~*)
- *How many people **work** in your office?* (not *~~How many people do work …?~~*)

But *do* can be used after a subject question word for emphasis, to insist on an answer.

- *Well, tell us – what **did happen** when your father found you?*
- *So who **did marry** the Princess in the end?*

:::note

For questions like *Who do you wish that you’d married?*, [(see here)](./../noun-clauses-direct-and-indirect-speech/that-clauses).

## Indirect questions: *Tell me when you are leaving.*

In an indirect question, we do not put an auxiliary before the subject, and we do not use a question mark. For details, [(see here)](./../noun-clauses-direct-and-indirect-speech/indirect-speech-questions-and-answers).

- ***Tell me what you want**.* (not *~~Tell me what do you want?~~*)

## Prepositions: *What are you talking about?*

Prepositions often come at the end of *wh*\-questions, separated from their objects. (For details, [(see here)](./../prepositions/prepositions-at-the-ends-of-clauses).)

- ***What** are you talking **about?*** (not *~~About what are you talking?~~*)
- ***Who** did you buy the ticket **from?***
- ***What** did you clean the floor **with?***

:::note

For negative questions, [(see here)](./negative-questions).

For ellipsis in questions (e.g. *Seen Jack?* *Coming tonight?*), [(see here)](./../information-structure/ellipsis-at-the-beginning-of-a-sentence).
