# Sentence structure: basic word order

## Subject – verb – object/complement

The basic word order of English clauses in positive statements is Subject – Verb – (Complement/Object).

- *Anna smiled.*
- *Sam is a doctor.*
- *My parents live in North Wales.*
- *The boss has bought another new car.*

In a few affirmative structures the verb can come before the subject (e.g. *So ***can I****, ****In came*** Mrs Parker*, [(see here)](./../information-structure/inversion-auxiliary-verb-before-subject).

For sentences that begin with the object (e.g. *Those people I can’t stand*), [(see here)](./../information-structure/fronting-this-question-we-have-already-discussed).

In informal language, especially speech, word order often departs from the basic pattern, [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/spoken-sentence-structure).

## Preparatory *it* and *there*

When the subject or object is an infinitive phrase or clause, we often put it at the end of a sentence, and use *it* as a preparatory subject or object ( [(see here)](./../information-structure/preparatory-it-subject).

- ***It**’s difficult **to understand what he wants**.*
- *She made **it** clear **that she disagreed**.*

*There* can be a preparatory subject for an indefinite expression [(see here)](./../be-have-and-do/there-is).

- ***There** is **a big spider** in the bath.*

## Direct and indirect objects

Indirect objects can come before direct objects (without a preposition) or after direct objects (with a preposition).

- *She sent **the nurse some flowers**.*
- *She sent **some flowers to the nurse**.*

## Questions: auxiliary before subject

Most written questions, and many spoken questions, have the order auxiliary verb – subject – main verb.

- *Have you seen Andrew?*
- *Where was she going?*
- *Did Emily phone?*

Indirect questions [(see here)](./../noun-clauses-direct-and-indirect-speech/indirect-speech-questions-and-answers) have the subject before the verb.

- *Do you know where **she was** going?*

## Negatives: auxiliary + *not*

Negative structures have *not* after an auxiliary verb.

- *The train **did not** stop.* (not *~~The train stopped not.~~*)

For word order in negative questions (e.g. *Why didn’t she come? / Why did she not come?*), [(see here)](./negative-questions).

## Adverbials: possible positions

Different adverbials can go in different places in a sentence: at the beginning, with the verb, or at the end. For details, [(see here)](../adverbs-and-adverbials/position-of-adverbials-introduction).

- ***Suddenly** I had a terrible thought.*
- *The children had **probably** gone home.*
- *I was playing **badly**.*
- *I’ll see you **at the club on Tuesday**.*

An adverbial cannot normally come between a verb and its object.

- *I **like mushrooms** very much.* (not *~~I like very much mushrooms.~~*)

## Subordinate clauses (*who …*, *after …* , *if …*, *because …*, *that …*, etc)

Relative clauses usually follow the nouns that they modify [(see here)](./../relative-clauses/relatives-basic-information).

- *The **woman who phoned** wanted to speak to the manager.*

Other kinds of clause have various positions, depending on their function and the overall sentence structure.

- ***How you do it** is your business.*
- *Everybody agreed **that they were wasting their time**.*

More than one position is often possible.

- ***If you need help**, call me.*
- *Call me **if you need help**.*

## Prepositions: *in what …* / *what … in*

In an informal style, a preposition can be separated from its object in certain structures. For details, [(see here)](./../prepositions/prepositions-at-the-ends-of-clauses). Compare:

- ***In what hotel** did the President stay?* (formal)
- ***What hotel** did the President stay **in**?* (informal)
