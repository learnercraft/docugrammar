# *have (got)*: possession, relationships and other states

## Meanings

We often use *have* to talk about states: possession, relationships, illnesses, the characteristics of people and things, and similar ideas.

- *Her father **has** an office in Westminster.*
- *They hardly **have** enough money to live on.*
- ***Do*** *you **have** any brothers or sisters?*
- *The Prime Minister **had** a bad cold.*
- *My grandmother **didn’t have** a very nice personality.*

Sometimes *have* simply expresses the fact of being in a particular situation.

- *She **has** a houseful of children this weekend.*
- *I think we **have** mice.*

## Progressive forms not used

Progressive forms of *have* are not used for these meanings.

- *She **has** three brothers.* (not *~~She is having three brothers.~~*)
- ***Do*** *you **have** a headache?* (not *~~Are you having a headache?~~*)

## Questions and negatives with *do*

In American English and modern British English, questions and negatives are commonly formed with *do* for these meanings.

- ***Does*** *the house **have** a garden?*
- *Her parents **did** not **have** very much money.*

## Shorter question and negative forms: *have you ...?*; *she has not*

Short question and negative forms (e.g. *have you ...?*, *she has not*) were common in older English. In modern English they are rather formal and uncommon (except in a few fixed expressions like *I haven’t the faintest idea*). They are not normally used in American English.

- ***Have you*** *an appointment?* (formal BrE only)
- ***Do*** *you **have** an appointment?* (AmE/BrE)
- *Angela **has not** the charm of her older sisters.* (formal BrE only)
- *Angela **does** not **have** the charm ...* (AmE/BrE)

## *have got*

In conversation and informal writing, we often use the double form *have got*.

- *I’**ve got** a new boyfriend.* (More natural in speech than *I have a new boyfriend*.)
- ***Has*** *your sister **got** a car?*
- *I **haven’t got** your keys.*

Note that *have got* means exactly the same as *have* in this case -- it is a present tense of *have*, not the present perfect of *get*.

## *have got*: details

*Do* is not used in questions and negatives with *got*.

- ***Have*** *you **got** a headache?* (not *~~Do you have got~~ ...*)
- *The house **hasn’t got** a cellar.* (not *~~The house doesn’t have got~~ ...*)

*Got*-forms of *have* are not used in short answers or tags.

- ‘*Have you got a light?*’ ‘*No, I **haven’t**.*’ (not *~~No, I haven’t got.~~*)
- *Anne’s got a bike, **hasn’t** she?*

*Got*-forms of *have* are less common in the past tense.

- *I **had** some problems last week.* (not *~~I had got some problems~~...*)
- ***Did*** *you **have** good teachers when you were at school?*

*Got* is not generally used with infinitives, participles or *-ing* forms of *have*: you cannot usually say *to have got a headache* or *having got a brother*. The infinitive of *have got* is occasionally used after modal verbs (e.g. *She must have got a new boyfriend*).

*Have got* is rather less common in American English, especially in questions and negatives.

In very informal American speech, people may drop *’ve* (but not ‘*s*) before *got*.

- *I(‘**ve**) **got** a problem.*

*Got*- and *do*-forms may be mixed in American English, especially when short answers, reply questions and tags follow *got*-forms.

- ‘*I’**ve** **got** a new apartment.*’ ‘*You **do**?*’

## Repeated states: *got* not used

When we are talking about repeated or habitual states, *got*-forms of *have* are less often used. Compare:

- *I **have** / I’**ve got** a headache.*  
  *I often **have** headaches.*
- ***Do*** *you **have** / **Have** you **got** time to go to London this weekend?*  
  ***Do*** *you ever **have** time to go to London?*
- *Sorry, I **don’t** **have** / **haven’t** **got** any beer.*  
  *We **don’t** usually **have** beer in the house.*

## Repetition: a change in British English

Traditionally in British English, *do* was used with *have* mostly in references to habit or repetition. Compare:

- ***Do*** *you often **have** meetings?*
- ***Have*** *you (**got**) a meeting today?*

In modern British English (which is heavily influenced by American English), *do*-forms are common even when there is no idea of repetition.

- ***Do*** *you **have** time to go to the beach this weekend?* (AmE / modern BrE)
