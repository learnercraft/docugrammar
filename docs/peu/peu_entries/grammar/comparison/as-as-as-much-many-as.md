# *as … as*; *as much/many as*

## Use

We use *as … as* to say that people or things are equal in some way.

- *She’s **as** tall **as** her brother.*
- *Is it **as** good **as** you expected?*
- *She speaks Spanish **as** well **as** the rest of us.*
- *Take **as** much time **as** you need.*

## Negative structures

After *not*, we can use *so … as* instead of *as … as*.

- *He’s **not as/so** friendly **as** she is.* (more informal than *He’s less friendly …*)

## *as … as possible*, etc

The structures *as … as possible*/*necessary*/*ever*/*needed* are common (and others using words with similar meanings).

- *Please get here **as** soon **as possible**.*
- *I’ll spend **as** much **as necessary**.*
- *You’re **as** beautiful **as ever**.*
- *We’ll do **as** much **as practicable** before the end of the week.*

## Pronouns after *as*

In an informal style we can use object pronouns (*me*, *him*, etc) after *as*.

- *She doesn’t sing as well **as me**.*

In a formal style, we prefer **subject + verb** after *as*.

- *She doesn’t sing as well **as I do**.*

A subject form without a verb (e.g. *as well as he*) is unusual in this structure in modern English.

## *as much/many … as*

We can use *as much/many … as* to talk about quantity.

- *I haven’t got **as much** money **as** I thought.*
- *We need **as many** people **as** possible.*

*As much/many* can be used without following nouns.

- *I ate **as much** as I could.*
- *She didn’t catch **as many** as she’d hoped.*

And *as much* … can be used as an adverb.

- *You ought to rest **as much** as possible.*

## Emphatic use: *as much as 80kg*

*As much*/*many as* can be used before a number to mean ‘the large amount/quantity of’.

- *Some of these fish can weigh **as much as 80**kg.*
- *There are sometimes **as many as 40** students in the classes.*

*As little*/*few* can be used to mean ‘the small amount/quantity of’.

- *You can fly to Paris for **as little as 20** euros.*

## *half as … as*, etc

*Half*, *twice*, *three times*, etc can be used before *as … as*.

- *You’re not **half as** clever **as** you think you are.*
- *I’m not going out with a man who’s **twice as** old **as** me.*
- *It took **three times as** long **as** I expected.* (or **… three times longer** than I expected, [(see here)](./comparison-advanced-points#three-times-er-etc))

## Modification: *nearly as …*

Before *as … as* we can use *(not) nearly*, *almost*, *just*, *nothing like*, *every bit*, *exactly*, *not quite*.

- *It’s **not nearly as** cold as yesterday.*
- *He’s **just as** strong as ever.*
- *You’re **nothing like as** bad-tempered as you used to be.*
- *She’s **every bit as** beautiful as her sister.*
- *I’m **not quite as** tired as I was last week.*

## Tenses

In *as … as*‐clauses (and other kinds of *as*‐clauses), a present tense is often used to refer to the future, and a past tense can have a meaning similar to *would* + infinitive [(see here)](./../conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/tense-simplification-in-subordinate-clauses).

- *We’ll get there as soon as you **do/will**.*
- *If you married me, I’d give you as much freedom as you **wanted**.*

## Leaving out the second part: *twice as long …*

The second part of the *as … as* or *so … as* structure can be left out when the meaning is clear from what comes before.

- *The train takes 40 minutes. By car it’ll take you twice **as long**.*
- *I used to think he was clever. Now I’m not **so sure**.*

In cases like this, *not so* is much more common than *not as*.

## Traditional expressions: *as cold as ice*

We use the structure *as … as …* in a lot of traditional comparative expressions.

- ***as** cold **as** ice*
- ***as** black **as** night*
- ***as** hard **as** nails*
- ***as** … **as** hell*

The first *as* can be dropped in these expressions in an informal style.

- *She’s **hard as nails**.*
- *I’m **tired as hell** of listening to your problems.*
