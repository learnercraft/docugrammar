# Introduction

A **sentence** can have more than one **clause**, usually joined by a **conjunction** which shows the relationship between them.

![](/img/peu_img/peu678.jpg)

- *We brought the food **and** they supplied the drink.* (addition)
- *She was poor **but** she was happy.* (contrast)
- *We can go swimming, **or** we could stay here.* (alternative)
- *People disliked her **because** she was so rude.* (cause)
- *I’ll phone you **when** I arrive.* (time)

## Subordinate clauses

One clause can be **subordinate** to another. A subordinate clause with its conjunction is a part of the other (**main**) clause – for example an object or an adverbial. For practical purposes, subordinate clauses can be divided into three main groups: **noun clauses**, **adverbial clauses** and **adjective (relative) clauses**.

**Noun clauses** function rather like noun phrases:

- *I told them **a lie**.*
- *I told them **that I knew nothing about it**.*

**Adverbial clauses** function rather like adverbials:

- *We drove home **at high speed**.*
- *We drove home **as fast as we could**.*

**Relative clauses** function rather like adjectives in noun phrases:

- *She told me a **funny** story.*
- *She told me a story **that made me laugh out loud**.*

Examples of **subordinating conjunctions**: *when*, *after*, *how*, *that*.

Some conjunctions are made up of two or more words, for example *as soon as*, *in case*.

## Co-ordinate clauses

Co-ordinate clauses have equal weight: neither is subordinate to the other.

- ***Dan cooked supper** and **Joe washed the dishes**.*
- ***The forecast was impressive** but **the results were disappointing**.*

Examples of co-ordinating conjunctions: *and*, *but*, *either … or*.

## No conjunction

Participles and infinitives can begin clauses [(*Infinitives, -ing forms and past participles: other uses*)](../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-other-uses/infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-other-uses-introduction). These are normally connected to other clauses with no conjunction.

- *I rushed out of the house, **slamming the door behind me**.*
- *He went up to his room, **to find a dog asleep on his bed**.*

This Section covers co-ordination (of phrases as well as clauses), and some general points to do with subordination. Particular types of subordinate clause are dealt with in [*if* section](../if/if-introduction), [*Other adverbial clause*](../other-adverbial-clauses/other-adverbial-clauses-introduction), [*Noun clauses, direct and indirect speech*](../noun-clauses-direct-and-indirect-speech/noun-clauses-direct-and-indirect-speech-introduction), [*Information structure*](../information-structure/information-structure-introduction).
