# Tense simplification in subordinate clauses

## Reasons for tense simplification

If the main verb of a sentence makes it clear what kind of time the speaker is talking about, it is not always necessary for the same time to be indicated again in subordinate clauses. Compare:

- *This discovery **means** that we **will spend** less on food.*  
  *This discovery **will mean** that we **spend** less on food.*
- *It **is** unlikely that he **will win**.*  
  *I **will pray** that he **wins**.*

Verbs in subordinate clauses are often simpler in form than verbs in main clauses – for example present instead of future, simple past instead of *would* + infinitive, simple past instead of past perfect.

- *You’ll find Coca-Cola wherever you **go**.* (not *~~… wherever you will go.~~*)
- *He would never do anything that **went** against his conscience.* (More natural than *… that would go against his conscience.*)
- *I hadn’t understood what she **said**.* (More natural than *… what she had said.*)

## Present instead of future: *I’ll write when I have time.*

Present tenses are often used instead of *will* + infinitive to refer to the future in subordinate clauses. This happens not only after conjunctions of time like *when*, *until*, *after*, *before*, *as soon as*, but in most other subordinate clauses – for instance after *if*, *whether* and *on condition that*, after question words and relative pronouns, and in indirect speech.

- *I’ll write to her when I **have** time.* (not *~~… when I will have time.~~*)
- *I’ll think of you when I’**m lying** on the beach.* (not *~~… when I will be lying …~~*)
- *Will you stay here until the plane **takes off**?*
- *It will be interesting to see whether he **recognises** you.*
- *I’ll have a good time whether I **win** or **lose**.*
- *I’ll go where you **go**.*
- *I’ll lend it to you on condition that you **bring** it back tomorrow.*
- *He says he’ll give five pounds to anybody who **finds** his pen.*
- *If she **asks** what I’**m doing**in her house, I’ll say I’**m checking** the gas.*

This can happen when the main verb is not future in form, but it refers to the future.

- *Phone me when you **arrive**.*
- *Make sure you **come** back soon.*
- *You can tell who you **like** next week, but not until then.*

In comparisons with *as* and *than*, present and future verbs are both possible.

- *She’ll be on the same train as we **are**/**will** tomorrow.*
- *We’ll get there sooner than you **do**/**will**.*

## Present perfect: *… when I’ve finished*

The present perfect is used instead of the future perfect, to express the idea of completion.

- *I’ll phone you when I’**ve finished**.* (not *~~… when I will have finished.~~*)
- *At the end of the year there will be an exam on everything you’**ve studied**.* (not *~~… everything you will have studied.~~*)

## Future in subordinate clauses: *… where she will be*

A future verb is necessary for future reference in a subordinate clause if the main verb does not refer to the future (or to the same time in the future).

- *I don’t know where she **will be** tomorrow.*
- *I’m sure I **won’t understand** a word of the lecture.*
- *I’ll hide it somewhere where he’**ll** never **find** it.* (two different future times)
- *If she rings, I’ll tell her that I’**ll ring** back later.* (two different future times)

:::note

For future verbs in *if*\-clauses (e.g. *I’ll give you £100 if it will help you to get home*), [(see here)](./../if/if-will).

## *in case*, *I hope*, *I bet, it doesn’t matter*, etc

A present tense is normally used with a future meaning after *in case* even if the main verb is present or past. For details, [(see here)](./../if/in-case-and-if).

- *I’ve got my tennis things in case we **have** time for a game tomorrow.*

In an informal style, present verbs are often used with future meanings after *I hope* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/hope) and *I bet* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/bet).

- *I hope you **sleep** well.*
- *I bet he **gets** married before the end of the year.*

Present tenses are also used with future reference after *it doesn’t matter*, *I don’t care*, *I don’t mind*, *it’s not important* and similar expressions.

- *It doesn’t matter where we **go** this summer.*
- *I don’t care what we **have** for dinner if I **don’t have** to cook it.*

## Past instead of *would …*

*Would*, like *will*, is avoided in subordinate clauses; instead, we generally use past verbs. This happens in *if*\-clauses [(see here)](./../if/special-structures-with-past-tenses-and-would), and also after most other conjunctions.

- *If I **had** lots of money, I would give some to anybody who **asked** for it.* (not *~~If I would have … who would ask for it.~~*)
- *Would you follow me wherever I **went**?* (not *~~… wherever I would go?~~*)
- *In a perfect world, you would be able to say exactly what you **thought**.* (not *~~… what you would think.~~*)
- *I would always try to help anybody who **was** in trouble, whether I **knew** them or not.*

:::note

For past tenses after *It’s time*, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/it-s-time); after *I’d rather*, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/rather-preference); after *I wish*, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/wish).

## Simplification of perfect and progressive verbs

Simple past verb forms are used quite often in subordinate clauses instead of present perfect and past perfect tenses, if the meaning is clear.

- *It’s been a good time while it<strong>(’s) lasted</strong>.*
- *I’ve usually liked the people I<strong>(’ve) worked</strong> with.*
- *For thirty years, he had done no more than he **(had) needed** to.*
- *He probably crashed because he had gone to sleep while he **was** driving.* (More natural than *… while he had been driving.*)

Progressives are often replaced by simple forms in subordinate clauses.

- *He’s working. But at the same time as he **works**, he’s exercising.* (or … at the same time as he’s working …)

## Exceptions

These rules do not usually apply to clauses beginning *because*, *although*, *since* or *as* (meaning ‘because’), or to non-identifying relative clauses [(see here)](./../relative-clauses/identifying-and-non-identifying-clauses-the-tall-man-who-mr-rogers-who).

- *I won’t see you next week because I’**ll be** in Canada.*
- *I’ll come to the opera with you, although I probably **won’t enjoy** it.*
- *You’ll work with Mr Harris, who **will explain** everything to you.*
