# Articles: basic information (A)

(This entry is for students who speak a language that has articles: e.g. French, German, Swedish, Norwegian, Spanish, Italian, Greek. If you speak a language without articles – for example Russian or Japanese – read entry [(see here)](./articles-basic-information-b).)

Articles are often used in similar ways in English and other languages, but there are some differences. The most important are as follows.

## Talking in general: *Life is complicated.*

In English, when we are talking about people or things in general, we do not usually use *the* with uncountable or plural nouns.

- ***Life** is complicated.* (not *~~The life is complicated.~~*)
- *My sister loves **horses**.* (not *~~… the horses.~~*)

## Talking about jobs, types, etc: *She’s a dentist.*

In English, we normally put *a/an* with a singular noun that is used for classifying – saying what job somebody has, what class, group or type somebody or something belongs to, what we use something for, etc.

- *She’s **a dentist**.* (not *~~She’s dentist.~~*)
- *I’m looking forward to being **a grandmother**.*
- *I used my shoe as **a hammer**.*
