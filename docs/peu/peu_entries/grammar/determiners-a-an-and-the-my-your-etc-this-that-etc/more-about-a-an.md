# More about a/an

## Countable and uncountable nouns

Countable nouns are the names of separate objects, people, ideas, etc which we can count.

- *a cat – three cats*
- *a secretary – four secretaries*
- *a plan – two plans*

Uncountable nouns are the names of materials, liquids and other things which we do not usually see as separate objects.

- *wool* (but not *~~a wool, two wools~~*)
- *water* (but not *~~a water, three waters~~*)
- *weather* (but not *~~a weather, four weathers~~*)
- *energy* (but not *~~an energy, several energies~~*)

## *a*/*an* with singular countable nouns

We normally use *a*/*an* only with singular countable nouns.

- ***a secretary***
- ***an office***
- but not *~~a salt~~* or *~~an offices~~*

:::note

For expressions like *a good two hours*, [(see here)](./../nouns-and-noun-phrases-agreement/mixed-singular-and-plural-other-structures#another-aan--adjective).

## Uses of *a*/*an*

*A*/*an* does not add much to the meaning of a noun – it is like a weak form of ‘one’. It has several common uses.

## One person or thing

We can use *a*/*an* when we mention one person or thing for the first time.

- *There’s **a police car** outside.*
- *My brother’s married to **a doctor**.*
- *Andy lives in **an old house**.*

## Any one member of a class

We can use *a*/*an* when we talk about **any one member** of a class.

- ***A doctor** must like people.* (= any doctor)
- *I would like to live in **an old house**.* (= any old house)

## Classifying and defining

We can use *a*/*an* when we classify or define people and things – when we say what they are, what job they do, or what they are used for.

- *She’s **a doctor**.*
- *I’m looking forward to being **a grandmother**.*
- *A glider is **a plane** with no engine.*
- *Don’t use your plate as **an ashtray**.*

## Descriptions

*A*/*an* is common before nouns that are used in descriptions.

- *She’s **a nice person**.*
- *He’s got **a friendly face**.*
- *That was **a lovely evening**.*
- *It’s **an extremely hot day**.*

## When *a/an* cannot be left out

We do not normally leave out *a*/*an* in negative expressions, after prepositions or after fractions.

- *‘Lend me your pen.’ ‘I have**n’t** got **a pen**.’* (not *~~I haven’t got pen.~~*)
- *You shouldn’t go out **without a coat**.* (not *~~… without coat.~~*)
- *three-quarters **of a pound*** (not *~~three-quarters of pound~~*)

And we do not leave out *a*/*an* when we say what jobs people have, or how things are used (see above).

- *She’s **an engineer**.* (not *~~She’s engineer.~~*)
- *I used my shoe as **a hammer**.* (not *~~… as hammer.~~*)

## When *a*/*an* is not used: adjectives alone; possessives

*A*/*an* cannot normally be used with an adjective alone (without a noun). Compare:

- *It’s **a good** car.*
- *It’s **good**.* (not *~~It’s a good.~~*)

*A*/*an* cannot be used together with a possessive. Instead, we can use the structure *a … of mine/yours*, etc [(see here)](./../pronouns/a-friend-of-mine-etc).

- *He’s **a friend of mine**.* (not *~~He’s a my friend.~~*)

## *a*/*an* and *the*

Instead of *a*/*an*, we use *the* when we want to say ‘You and I both know which one I mean’. Compare:

- *She lives in **a big house**.* (The hearer doesn’t know which one.)
- *She lives in **the big house** over there.* (The hearer knows which one.)

For details, [(see here)](./more-about-the).

## *a* and *an*: the difference

We do not normally pronounce the sound /ə/ before a vowel. So before a vowel, the article *a* (/ə/) changes to *an* (/ən/). Compare:

- *a rabbit*
- *a lemon*
- *an elephant*
- *an orange*

 The choice between *a* and *an* depends on pronunciation, not spelling. We use *an* before a vowel sound, even if it is written as a consonant.

- *an hour* /ən ˈaʊə(r)/
- *an MP* /ən em ˈpiː/

And we use *a* before a consonant sound, even if it is written as a vowel.

- *a university* /ə juːnɪˈvɜːsəti/
- *a one-pound coin* /ə ˌwʌn ˌpaʊnd ˈkɔɪn/

Some people say *an*, not *a*, before words beginning with *h* if the first syllable is unstressed.

- *an hotel* (a hotel is more common)
- *an historic occasion* (*a historic* … is more common)
- *an hypothesis* (*a hypothesis* is more common)
- but not *~~an housewife~~* – the first syllable is stressed.

*A* is sometimes pronounced /eɪ/ before a hesitation, when we want to emphasise the following word, or when we want to make a contrast with *the*.

- *I think I’ll have a* /eɪ/ *– chocolate ice cream.*
- *It’s a* /eɪ/ *reason – it’s not the only reason.*
