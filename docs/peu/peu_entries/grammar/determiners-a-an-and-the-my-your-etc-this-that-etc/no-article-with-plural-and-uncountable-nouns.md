# No article with plural and uncountable nouns

## *a/an* not used

Plural and uncountable nouns (e.g. *cats*, *wool* [(see here)](./more-about-a-an#countable-and-uncountable-nouns) cannot normally be used with *a/an* (because *a/an* has a similar meaning to ‘one’). Instead, we most often use no article.

- *There were **cats** in every room.* (not *~~… a cats …~~*)
- *Doctors generally work long **hours**.*
- *Her coat is made of pure **wool**.*
- *He’s got very big **ears**.*
- *‘What’s that?’ ‘I think it’s **salt**.’*

## Confusing nouns

Some nouns that are countable in some other languages are uncountable in English [(see here)](./../nouns-and-noun-phrases-agreement/countable-and-uncountable-nouns-basic-information#travel-and-a-journey-a-piece-of-advice) for a list).

- *I need **information** and **advice**.* (not *~~… an information and an advice~~*)
- *You’ve made very good **progress**.* (not *~~… a very good progress.~~*)

And note that we never use *a/an* with *weather* or *English*.

- *We’re having terrible **weather**.* (not *~~… a terrible weather.~~*)
- *She speaks very good **English**.* (not *~~… a very good English.~~*)

## *some* and *any*

Instead of no article, we can sometimes use *some* or *any*.

- *We met **some** nice Danish girls in Scotland.*
- *Have you got **any** matches?*

For details, [(see here)](./the-difference-between-some-any-and-no-article).

## *the*

Instead of no article, we use *the* when we want to say ‘You and I both know which I mean’ [(see here)](./more-about-the). Compare:

- *I’m working with **children**.* (The hearer doesn’t know which ones.)  
  *How are **the children**?* (= the hearer’s children)
- *We need **salt**.* (= any salt)  
  *Could you pass **the salt**?* (The hearer can see the salt that is wanted.)

But we usually use no article, not *the*, to talk about people, things, etc in general [(see here)](./talking-in-general).

- *Are **dogs** more intelligent than cats?* (not *~~… the dogs … the cats~~*)
- *Everybody likes **music**.* (not *~~… the music.~~*)

:::note

For expressions like *a coffee*, *a knowledge of Spanish*, [(see here)](./../nouns-and-noun-phrases-agreement/countable-and-uncountable-nouns-basic-information#materials-glass-paper-etc), [(see here)](./../nouns-and-noun-phrases-agreement/countable-and-uncountable-nouns-basic-information#abstract-nouns-time-life-experience-etc).
