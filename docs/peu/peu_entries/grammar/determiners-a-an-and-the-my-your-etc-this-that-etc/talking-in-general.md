# Talking in general

## *the* does not mean ‘all’

We do not use *the* with uncountable or plural nouns to talk about things in general – to talk about all books, all people or all life, for example. *The* does not mean ‘all’. Instead, we use **no article**. Compare:

- *Move **the books** off that chair and sit down.* (= particular books)  
  ***Books** are expensive.* (not *~~The books are expensive.~~*)
- *I’m studying **the life** of Beethoven.* (= one particular life)  
  ***Life** is complicated.* (not *~~The life …~~*)
- *‘Where’s **the cheese**?’ ‘I ate it.’*  
  *I love **cheese**.*
- *I’ve joined **the** local Dramatic **Society**.*  
  *It’s not always easy to fit in with **society**.*
- *I never really understood **the nature** of my father’s work.*  
  *She’s very interested in **nature**, especially animals and birds.*
- *Write your name in **the space** at the bottom of the page.*  
  *Would you like to travel into **space**?*
- *Why has **the light** gone out?*  
  *Nothing can travel faster than **light**.*

Note that *most* (meaning ‘the majority of’) is used without *the*.

- ***Most** birds can fly.* (not *~~The most birds …~~*)
- ***Most** of the children got very tired.* (not *~~The most of the children …~~*)

## Generalisations with singular countable nouns

Sometimes we talk about things in general by using *the* with a singular countable noun.

- *Schools should concentrate more on **the child** and less on exams.*

This is common with the names of scientific instruments and inventions, and musical instruments.

- *Life would be quieter without **the telephone**.*
- ***The violin** is more difficult than **the piano**.*

We can also generalise by talking about one example of a class, using *a*/*an* (meaning ‘any’) with a singular countable noun.

- ***A baby deer** can stand as soon as it’s born.*
- ***A child** needs plenty of love.*

Note that we cannot use *a*/*an* in this way when we are generalising about all of the members of a group together.

- ***The tiger** is in danger of becoming extinct.* (not *~~A tiger is in danger of becoming extinct.~~* The sentence is about the whole tiger family, not about individuals.)
- *Do you like **horses**?* (not *~~Do you like a horse?~~*)

:::note

For the use of *the* + adjective to generalise about groups (e.g. *the old*, *the blind* ), [(see here)](./../adjectives/adjectives-without-nouns).
