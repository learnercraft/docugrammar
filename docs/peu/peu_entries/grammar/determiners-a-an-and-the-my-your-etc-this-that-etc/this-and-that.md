# *this* and *that*

## Determiners or pronouns

*This/that/these/those* are often called ‘**demonstratives**’ in grammars. They can be used as determiners at the beginning of noun phrases. (They are not adjectives, though they are sometimes called ‘demonstrative adjectives’ in older grammars and dictionaries.)

- *Look at **that butterfly**.*
- *Let me show you **these patterns**.*

They can also be used without nouns, as ‘**demonstrative pronouns**’.

- *Look at **this**.*
- ***That’s** terrible!*

Determiner and pronoun uses are both covered in this entry for convenience.

## People and things

*This*/*that*/*these*/*those* can be used as determiners with nouns that refer to either people or things.

- ***this** child*
- ***that** house*

But when they are used without nouns (‘pronoun’ use), *this*/*that*/*these*/*those* normally only refer to things.

- ***This** costs more than **that**.* (but not *~~This says he’s tired.~~*)
- *Put **those** down – they’re dirty.* (but not *~~Tell those to go away.~~*)

However, *this*, etc can be used without nouns for people when we say who the people are.

- *Hello. **This** is Elisabeth. Is **that** Ruth?*
- ***That** looks like Mrs Walker.*
- *Who’s **that**?*
- ***These** are the Smiths.*

Note also ***Those who …*** [(see here)](./this-and-that#that-those-meaning-the-ones) below).

For a similar use of *it* to refer to people, [(see here)](./../pronouns/personal-pronouns-basic-information#it-used-to-identify).

## The difference

We use *this*/*these* for people and things which are close to the speaker.

- ***This** is very nice – can I have some more?*
- *Get **this** cat off my shoulder.*
- *I don’t know what I’m doing in **this** country.* (not *~~… in that country.~~*)
- *Do you like **these** earrings? Joseph gave them to me.*

We use *that*/*those* for people and things which are more distant from the speaker, or not present.

- ***That** smells nice – is it for lunch?*
- *Get **that** cat off the piano.*
- *All the time I was in **that** country I hated it.*
- *I like **those** earrings. Where did you get them?*

## Time

*This*/*these* can refer to situations and events which are going on or just about to start.

- *I like **this** music. What is it?*
- *Listen to **this**. You’ll like it.* (not *~~Listen to that …~~*)
- *Watch **this**.*
- ***This** is a police message.*

*That*/*those* can refer to situations and events which have just finished, or which are more distant in the past.

- ***That** was nice. What was it?* (not *~~This was nice …~~*)
- *Did you see **that**?*
- *Who said **that**?*
- *Have you ever heard from **that** Scottish boy you used to go out with?* (not *~~… this Scottish boy you used to go out with.~~*)

*That* can show that something has come to an end.

- *… and **that**’s how it happened.*
- *‘Anything else?’ ‘No, **that**’s all, thanks.’* (in a shop)
- *OK. **That**’s it. I’m leaving. It was nice knowing you.*

## Acceptance and rejection

We sometimes use *this*/*these* to show acceptance or interest, and *that*/*those* to show dislike or rejection. Compare:

- *Now tell me about **this** new boyfriend of yours.*
- *I don’t like **that** new boyfriend of yours.*

## On the telephone

On the telephone, British people use *this* to identify themselves, and *that* to ask about the hearer’s identity.

- *Hello. **This** is Max. Is **that** Alex?*

Americans can also use *this* to ask about the hearer’s identity.

- *Who is **this**?*

## *that*, *those* meaning ‘the one(s)’

In a formal style, *that* and *those* can be used with a following description to mean ‘the one(s)’. *Those who …* means ‘the people who …’

- *A dog’s intelligence is much greater than **that** of a cat.*
- ***Those** who can, do. **Those** who can’t, teach.*

## *this* and *that* meaning ‘so’

In an informal style, *this* and *that* are often used with adjectives and adverbs in the same way as *so*.

- *I didn’t realise it was going to be **this** hot.*
- *If your boyfriend’s **that** clever, why isn’t he rich?*

In standard English, only *so* is used before a following clause.

- *It was **so** cold that I couldn’t feel my fingers.* (not *~~It was that cold that …~~*)

*Not all that* can be used to mean ‘not very’.

- *‘How was the play?’ ‘**Not all that** good.’*

## Other uses

Note the special use of *this* (with no demonstrative meaning) in conversational story-telling.

- *There was **this** travelling salesman, you see. And he wanted …*

*That*/*those* can suggest that an experience is familiar to everybody.

- *I can’t stand **that** perfume of hers.*

This use is common in advertisements.

- *When you get **that** empty feeling – break for a snack.*
- *Earn more money during **those** long winter evenings. Call …*

:::note

The differences between *this* and *that* are similar to the differences between *here* and *there* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/here-and-there), *come* and *go* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/come-and-go) and *bring* and *take* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/bring-and-take).

For *this one*, *that one*, etc, [(see here)](./../pronouns/one-substitute-word-a-big-one).

For *these* and *those* with singular *kind of*, *sort of*, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/sort-of-kind-of-and-type-of).

For *that which*, [(see here)](./../relative-clauses/relatives-advanced-points#older-english-who-and-that-which).
