# *all* and *whole*

## Pronunciation

- all /ɔːl/
- whole /həʊl/

## Word order

*All* (of) (especially BrE) and *whole* can be used with singular noun phrases to mean ‘complete’, ‘every part of’. The word order is different.

:::tip[Grammar]

*all* (of) + determiner + noun

:::

:::tip[Grammar]

determiner + *whole* + noun

:::

- *Julie spent **all (of) the** summer at home.*  
  *Julie spent **the whole** summer at home.*
- ***all (of) my** life*  
  ***my whole** life*

## Indefinite reference

*All* is not generally used before indefinite articles.

- *She’s eaten **a whole** loaf.* (not *~~… **all a** loaf.~~*)

## Uncountable nouns

With most uncountable nouns we prefer *all* (of).

- *I’ve drunk **all (of) the milk**.* (not *~~… **the whole milk**.~~*)

## *the whole of* (mainly BrE)

Instead of *whole*, *the whole of* is also possible, especially in British English.

- *Julie spent **the whole of** the summer at home.*
- ***the whole of** my life*

Before proper nouns*(names) and pronouns we always use *the whole of*, not *whole*.*All (of) is also possible.

- ***The whole of / All of** Venice was under water.* (not *~~Whole Venice …~~*)
- *I’ve just **read the whole of / all of** ‘War and Peace’.*
- *I’ve read **the whole of / all of** it.*

## Plural nouns

With plural nouns, *all* and *whole* have different meanings. *All* is like *every*; *whole* means ‘complete’, ‘entire’. Compare:

- ***All Indian tribes** suffered from white settlement in America.* (= Every Indian tribe suffered …)
- ***Whole Indian tribes** were killed off.* (= Complete tribes were killed off; nobody was left alive in these tribes.)
