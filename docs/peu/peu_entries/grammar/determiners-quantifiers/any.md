# *any*

## Meaning: indefinite amount or number

*Any* is a determiner. It generally suggests an indefinite amount or number, and is used when it is not important to say how much/many we are thinking of. Because of its ‘open’, non-specific meaning, *any* is often used in questions and negative clauses, and in other cases where there is an idea of doubt or negation.

- *Is there **any** more coffee?*
- *We didn’t have **any** problems going through customs.*
- *You never give me **any** help.*
- *The noise of the party prevented me from getting **any** sleep.*
- *I suddenly realised I’d come out without **any** money.*

*Any* is common after *if*.

- ***If** you find **any** blackberries, keep some for me.*

Sometimes *any* means ‘if there is/are any’ or ‘whatever there is/are’.

- ***Any** fog will clear by noon.* (= If there is any fog, it will clear by noon.)
- *Perhaps you could correct **any** mistakes I’ve made.*

*Any* can be used to emphasise the idea of open choice: ‘it doesn’t matter who/what/which’.

- *You can borrow **any** book you want.*

For details of this use, [(see here)](./any-it-doesn-t-matter-who-which-what).

## *any* and *some*

*Any* often contrasts with *some*, which is most common in affirmative clauses. Compare:

- *I need **some** razor blades.*
- *Do you have **any** razor blades?*
- *Sorry, I don’t have **any** razor blades.*

For details of the difference, [(see here)](./some-and-any-the-main-differences).

## *any* and *not any*

*Any* alone does not have a negative meaning. It is only negative when used with *not*.

- *She’s unhappy because she has**n’t** got **any** friends.* (not *~~… because she has got any friends.~~*)

*No* [(see here)](./no-none-and-not-a-any) means the same as *not any*, but is more emphatic.

- *She’s got **no** friends.*

*Not any* cannot begin a sentence; *no* is used instead.

- ***No** cigarette is harmless.* (not *~~Not any cigarette …~~*)
- ***No** tourists came to the town that year.*

We do not usually use *not any* with singular countable nouns (but [(see here)](./any-it-doesn-t-matter-who-which-what).

- *She hasn’t got **a job**.* (not *~~She hasn’t got any job.~~*)

## When *any* is not used

With an uncountable or plural noun, *any* usually suggests the idea of an indefinite but limited amount or number. When there is no idea of a limited quantity or number, we do not usually use *any*. Compare:

- *Is there **any water** in that can?*  
  *Is there **water** on the moon?* (The interest is in the existence of water, not its amount.)
- *Dad hasn’t got **any hair**.* (He has lost the amount he had.)  
  *Birds have feathers, not **hair**.* (No idea of amount.)
- *None of her children have got **any sense**.* (Not even a small amount.)  
  *Anna looks like her mother, but she hasn’t got **blue eyes**.* (not *~~… she hasn’t got any blue eyes~~* – people have a definite number of eyes: two.)

## *any* and *any of*

Before a determiner (definite article, demonstrative or possessive word) or a pronoun, we use *any of*. Compare:

- *I didn’t go to **any** lectures last term.* (not *~~… any of lectures …~~*)  
  *I wasn’t interested in **any of the** lectures.* (not *~~… any the lectures.~~*)
- *Do **any** books here belong to you?*  
  *Do **any of these** books belong to you?*
- *I don’t think **any staff** want to work tomorrow.*  
  *I don’t think **any of us** want to work tomorrow.*

Note that when *any of* is followed by a plural subject, the verb can be singular or plural. A singular verb is more common in a formal style.

- *If **any** of your **friends is/are** interested, let me know.*

## Without a noun

A noun can be dropped after *any*, if the meaning is clear.

- *‘Did you get the oil?’ ‘No, there wasn’t **any** left.’*

Instead of *not any* without a noun, *none* [(see here)](./no-none-and-not-a-any) can be used. This is often more emphatic.

- *There was **none** left.*

We don’t use *any* or *not any* alone as answers.

- *‘What day should I come?’ ‘**Any day**.’* (not *~~Any.~~*)
- *‘How much money do you have?’ ‘**None**.’* (not *~~Not any.~~*)

## Compounds

Many of the rules given above also apply to the compounds *anybody*, *anyone*, *anything* and *anywhere*. For more information about these, [(see here)](./../pronouns/somebody-someone-anybody-anyone-etc).
