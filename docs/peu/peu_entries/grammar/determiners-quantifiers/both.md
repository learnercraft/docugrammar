# *both*

## Meaning

*Both* means ‘each of two’.

- ***Both** my parents were born in Scotland.*

When the meaning is not ‘each of two’, we normally use a different expression.

- ***My two** brothers carried the piano upstairs.* (More natural than *Both my brothers carried the piano upstairs* – they didn’t each carry it separately.)

## *both* and *both of*

Before a noun with a determiner (e.g. *the, my, these*), *both* and *both of* are equally possible.

- *She’s eaten **both (of) the** chops.*
- ***Both (of) these** oranges are bad.*
- *He lost **both (of) his** parents when he was a child.*

We often drop *the* or a possessive after *both*; *of* is not used in this case.

- *She’s eaten **both chops**.* (not *~~… both of chops~~*)
- *He lost **both parents** when he was a child.*

## *the* not used before *both*

Note that we do not put *the* before *both*.

- ***both (the)** children* (not *~~the both children~~*)

## Personal pronouns: *both of*

With personal pronouns, we use *both of* + *us*/*you*/*them*. *Both of us*/*you*/*them* can be a subject or object.

- ***Both of them** can come tomorrow.*
- *She’s invited **both of us**.*
- *Emily sends **both of you** her love.*

We can put *both* after pronouns used as objects.

- *She’s invited **us both**.*
- *Emily sends **you both** her love.*

But this structure is not used in complements (after *be*) or in short answers.

- *‘Who broke the window – Sarah or Alice?’ ‘It was **both of them’** .* (not *~~… them both.~~*)
- *‘Who did she invite?’ ‘**Both of us**.’* (not *~~Us both.~~*)

## Position with verb

When *both* refers to the subject of a clause, it can go with the verb, in ‘mid-position’, like *all* and *each* (for details of word order, [(see here)](./../adverbs-and-adverbials/mid-position-details).

- *We **can both swim**.*
- *The children **have both gone** to bed.*
- *Those oranges **were both** bad.*
- *My sisters **both work** in education.*

Note that these meanings can also be expressed by using *both* (of) with a subject (see above).

- ***Both of us** can swim.*
- ***Both (of) the children** have gone to bed.*

## Negative structures

Instead of *both … not*, we normally use *neither* [(see here)](./neither).

- ***Neither of them** is here.* (not *~~Both of them are not here.~~*)
