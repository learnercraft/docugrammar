# *each*

## *each* + singular

*Each* is a determiner. We use it before a singular noun.

- *I enjoy **each moment**.* (not *~~… each moments.~~*)

A following verb is also singular.

- *Each new day **is** different.* (not *~~… are different.~~*)

## *each of*

We use *each of* before a plural pronoun, or before a determiner (for example *the*, *my*, *these*) with a plural noun.

- ***Each of us** sees the world differently.*
- *I phone **each of my children** once a week.*

A following verb is normally singular.

- *Each of them **has** problems.*

## Position with object

*Each* can follow an object (direct or indirect), but does not normally come at the end of a clause.

- *She kissed **them each** on the forehead.* (but not *~~She kissed them each.~~*)
- *I want **them each** to make their own decision.*
- *I sent **the secretaries each** a Christmas card.*

However, *each* can come at the end of a clause in expressions referring to exact amounts and quantities.

- *They cost **£3.50 each**.*
- *I bought the girls **two pairs of trainers each**.*

## Without a noun

We can drop a noun after *each*, if the meaning is clear. However, *each one* or *each of them* is more common in an informal style.

- *I’ve got five brothers, and **each (one/of them)** lives in a different city.*

## With the verb

When *each* refers to the subject, it can also go with a verb in mid-position, like *all* and some adverbs (for details of word order, [(see here)](./../adverbs-and-adverbials/mid-position-details). In this case plural nouns, pronouns and verbs are used.

- *They **have each been** told.*
- *We **can each apply** for our own membership card.*
- *You **are each right** in a different way.*
- *The plans **each have** certain advantages and disadvantages.*

:::note

For the difference between *each* and *every*, [(see here)](./each-and-every-the-difference).
