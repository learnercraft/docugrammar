# *much* and *many*

## The difference

*Much* is used with singular (uncountable) nouns; *many* is used with plurals.

- *I haven’t got **much time**.*
- *I don’t know **many** of your **friends**.*

## *much/many of*

We use *much/many of* before another determiner (article, possessive, etc) or a pronoun. Compare:

- *She didn’t eat **much** breakfast.* (not *~~… much of breakfast.~~*)  
  *She didn’t eat **much of her** breakfast.*
  *She didn’t eat **much of** it.*
- *There aren’t **many** large glasses left.*  
  *There aren’t **many of the** large glasses left.*
  *There aren’t **many of them** left.*

However, *much of* can be used directly before personal and geographical names.

- *I’ve seen too **much of** Howard recently.*
- *Not **much of** Denmark is hilly.*

## *much/many* without a noun

We can drop a noun after *much* or *many*, if the meaning is clear.

- *You haven’t eaten **much**.*
- *‘Did you find any mushrooms?’ ‘Not **many**.’*

Note that *much* and *many* are only used like this when a noun has been dropped.

- *There wasn’t **much (food)**.* (but not *~~The food wasn’t much.~~* No noun has been dropped. You couldn’t say *~~The food wasn’t much food~~.*)

*Many* is not usually used alone to mean ‘many people’.

- ***Many people** think it’s time for a change.* (More natural than *Many think …*)

## Not used in affirmative clauses

In an informal style, we use *much* and *many* mostly in questions and negative clauses. In most informal affirmative clauses they are unusual (especially *much*); other words and expressions are used instead.

- *‘How **much** money have you got?’ ‘I’ve got **plenty**.’* (not *~~I’ve got much.~~*)
- *He’s got **lots of** men friends, but he doesn’t know **many** women.* (More natural than *He’s got many men friends* …)
- *‘Did you buy any clothes?’ ‘Yes, **lots**.’* (not *~~Yes, many.~~*)

In a formal style, *much* and *many* are more common in affirmative clauses.

- ***Much** has been written about unemployment. In the opinion of **many** economists, …*

*Far* and *long* (= a long time) are also used mostly in questions and negative clauses. [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/far-and-a-long-way), [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/long-and-for-a-long-time)

## After *so*, *as* and *too*

*So much/many*, *as much/many* and *too much/many* are quite natural in affirmative clauses.

- *There was **so much** traffic that it took me an hour to get home.*
- *I play **as much** tennis as I can.*
- *You make **too many** mistakes.*

## *my many friends*, etc

Note that *many* can follow possessives in expressions like *my many friends*, *her many prizes*. This is rather formal.

## *much* as adverb

We can use *much* as an adverb in questions and negative clauses.

- *Do you work **much** at weekends?*
- *I don’t travel **much** these days.*

We can also use *much* before comparative adjectives and adverbs, in affirmative clauses as well as questions and negatives.

- *She’s **much older** than her brother.*
- *I don’t drive **much faster** than you.*

*Much* can be used before some verbs expressing enjoyment, preference and similar ideas, in affirmative clauses as well as questions and negatives, especially in a formal style.

- *I **much appreciate** your help.*
- *We **much prefer** the country to the town.*
- *I didn’t **much enjoy** the concert.*

*Very much* can be used in affirmative clauses as an adverb.

- *I **very much** like your new hairstyle.*
- *Thank you **very much**.*
