# *some*

## Meaning: indefinite quantity/number

*Some* is a determiner. It often suggests an indefinite quantity or number, and is used when it is not important to say exactly how much/many we are thinking of.

- *I need **some** new clothes.*
- *Would you like **some** tea?*

## Pronunciation

When *some* has this indefinite meaning, it usually has a ‘weak’ pronunciation /s(ə)m/ before (adjective +) noun.

- *some* /s(ə)m/ *new clothes*
- *some* /s(ə)m/ *tea*

## *some* and *any*

With this meaning, *some* is most common in affirmative clauses, and in questions which expect or encourage the answer ‘Yes’. In other cases, *any* is generally used. For details, [(see here)](./some-and-any-the-main-differences). Compare:

- *There are **some** children at the front door.*  
  *Do you mind if I put **some** music on?*
- *Did you meet **any** interesting people on the trip?*  
  *She hasn’t got **any** manners.*

## *some* and *a*/*an*

*Some* (in this sense) is used in similar ways to the indefinite article *a*/*an* [(see here)](./../determiners-a-an-and-the-my-your-etc-this-that-etc/more-about-a-an). However, it is not normally used with the same kind of nouns. Compare:

- *I need **a** new **coat**.* (singular countable noun) (not *~~… some new coat.~~*)
- *I need **some** new **shirts**.* (plural countable noun)
- *I need **some help**.* (uncountable noun)

## When *some* is not used

With an uncountable or plural noun, *some* usually suggests the idea of an indefinite (but not very large) quantity or number. When there is no idea of a limited quantity or number, we do not usually use *some*. For details, [(see here)](./../determiners-a-an-and-the-my-your-etc-this-that-etc/the-difference-between-some-any-and-no-article). Compare:

- *We’ve planted **some roses** in the garden.* (a limited number)  
  *I like **roses**.* (no idea of number)
- *Bring **some food** in case we get hungry.*  
  *The President has appealed for **food** for the earthquake victims.*

## *some* and *some of*; *some* with no following noun

Before another determiner (article, demonstrative or possessive word) or a pronoun, we use *some of*. Compare:

- *I’ve got tickets for **some** concerts next month.* (not *~~… some of concerts …~~*)  
  *Dan’s coming to **some of the** concerts.* (not *~~… some the concerts …~~*)
- ***Some** people want to get to sleep.* (not *~~… some of people …~~*)  
  ***Some of us** want to get to sleep.* (not *~~Some us …~~*)

Nouns can be dropped after *some*, if the meaning is clear.

- *I’ve got too many strawberries. Would you like **some**?*

Before *of*, or with no following noun, *some* is pronounced /sʌm/.

- *some* /sʌm/ *of us*
- *Would you like some* /sʌm/*?*

## Contrast with *others*, etc

*Some* (pronounced /sʌm/) can have a more emphatic meaning, contrasting with *others*, *all* or *enough*.

- ***Some** people like the sea; **others** prefer the mountains.*
- ***Some** of us were late, but we were **all** there by ten o’clock.*
- *I’ve got **some** money, but not **enough**.*

## An unknown person or thing

*Some* (/sʌm/) can refer to an unknown person or thing (usually with a singular countable noun).

- ***Some** idiot has taken the bath plug.*
- *There must be **some** job I could do.*
- *She’s living in **some** village in Yorkshire.*

We can use this structure to suggest that we are not interested in somebody or something, or that we do not think much of him/her/it.

- *Emily’s gone to America to marry **some** sheep farmer or other.*
- *I don’t want to spend my life doing **some** boring little office job.*

## *some party!*

In informal speech, *some* can show enthusiastic appreciation.

- *It was **some** party!*

## With numbers

*Some* (/sʌm/) with a number suggests that the number is high or impressive.

- *We have exported **some four thousand** tons of bootlaces this year.*
