# "in case" and "if"

## Precautions

In British English, *in case* is mostly used to talk about precautions – things which we do in order to be ready for possible future situations.

- *I always take an umbrella **in case** it rains.* (= … because it might rain.)

To talk about the future, we use a present tense after *in case* [(see here)](./../conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/tense-simplification-in-subordinate-clauses).

- *I’ve bought a chicken **in case** your mother **stays** to lunch.* (not *~~… in case your mother will stay …~~*)

## *in case … happen to*

We can use the expression *happen to* after *in case* to emphasise the meaning of ‘by chance’.

- *I’ve bought a chicken in case your mother **happens to** stay to lunch.*
- *We took our swimming things in case we **happened to** find a pool.*

*Should* can be used in the same way in British English, but this is no longer very common.

- *… in case your mother **should** stay to lunch.*

## *in case* and *if*

In British English, *in case* and *if* are normally used in quite different ways.

‘Do A *in case* B happens’ means ‘Do A (first) because B might happen later’.

‘Do A *if* B happens’ means ‘Do A if B has already happened’. Compare:

- *Let’s buy a bottle of wine **in case** George comes.* (= Let’s buy some wine now because George might come later.)  
  *Let’s buy a bottle of wine **if** George comes.* (= We’ll wait and see. If George comes, then we’ll buy the wine. If he doesn’t we won’t.)
- *I’m taking an umbrella **in case** it rains.*  
  *I’ll open the umbrella **if** it rains.* (not *~~I’ll open the umbrella in case it rains.~~*)
- *People insure their houses **in case** they catch fire.* (not *~~… if they catch fire.~~*)  
  *People telephone the fire brigade **if** their houses catch fire.* (not *~~… telephone … in case their houses catch fire.~~*)

In American English, *in case* is often used in a similar way to *if*.

- ***In case** you’re free this evening, give me a call.* (less typical of British English)

## *in case of*

The prepositional phrase *in case of* has a wider meaning than the conjunction *in case*, and can be used in similar situations to *if* in both American English and British English.

- ***In case of** fire, break glass.* (= If there is a fire …)
