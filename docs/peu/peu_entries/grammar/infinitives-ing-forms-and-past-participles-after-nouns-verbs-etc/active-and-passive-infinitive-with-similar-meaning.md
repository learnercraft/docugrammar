# Active and passive infinitive with similar meaning

## Obligation

We can use noun + infinitive to talk about obligation – things that people have to do. Active and passive infinitives are often both possible.

- *There’s a lot of **work to do** / **to be done**.*
- *Give me the names of the **people to contact** / **to be contacted**.*
- *The **people to interview** / **to be interviewed** are in the next room.*

We prefer active infinitives if we are thinking more about the person who will do the action.

- *I’ve got work **to do**.* (not *~~I’ve got work to be done.~~*)
- *They’ve sent **Megan** a form **to complete**.*

We use passive infinitives if we are thinking more about the action, or the person/thing that the action is done to.

- *The **carpets to be cleaned** are in the garage.* (not *~~The carpets to clean …~~*)
- *His desk is covered with **forms to be filled in**.*

After *be*, we normally use passive infinitives.

- *These sheets **are to be washed**.* (not *~~These sheets are to wash.~~*)
- *This form **is to be filled in** in ink.* (not *~~This form is to fill in …~~*)
- *The cleaning **is to be finished** by midday.* (not *~~… is to finish …~~*)

## *to be seen*/*found*/*congratulated*, etc

Note the expressions *anywhere*/*nowhere to be seen*/*found*.

- *He wasn’t **anywhere to be seen**.* (not *~~… anywhere to see.~~*)
- *Susan was **nowhere to be found**.* (not *~~… nowhere to find.~~*)

We also use passive infinitives to express value judgements with verbs like *congratulate*, *encourage*, *avoid*.

- *You are **to be congratulated**.* (not *~~… to congratulate.~~*)
- *This behaviour is **to be encouraged**.*

But note the common expression *to blame*, meaning ‘responsible’ (for some unfortunate event).

- *Nobody was **to blame** for the accident.*

## *nothing to do* and *nothing to be done*, etc

Note the difference between *nothing to do* and *nothing to be done*.

- *I’m bored – there’s **nothing to do**.* (= There are no entertainments.)
- *There’s **nothing to be done** – we’ll have to buy a new one.* (= There’s no way of putting it right.)
