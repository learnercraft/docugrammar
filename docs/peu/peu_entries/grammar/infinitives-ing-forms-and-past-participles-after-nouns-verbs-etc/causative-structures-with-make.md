# Causative structures with *make*

## Object + infinitive

After *make* + object, we use the infinitive without *to* [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles/infinitives-without-to-i-saw-you-come-in).

- *I made her **cry**.* (not *~~I made her to cry.~~*) or *~~I made her crying.~~*

Note that the infinitive must follow the object.

- *I can’t make **the washing machine work**.* (not *~~I can’t make work the washing machine.~~*)

In passive structures the infinitive with *to* is used.

- *She **was made to repeat** the whole story.*

## *make oneself understood*, etc

In a few cases *make* can be followed by *myself*, *yourself*, etc, and a past participle. The structure is common with *understood* and *heard*.

- *I don’t speak good Japanese, but I can **make myself understood**.* (not *~~… make myself understand.~~*)
- *She had to shout **to make herself heard**.*

## With object + object complement: *make people welcome*, etc

We can talk about an effect or change with *make* + object + adjective/noun [(see here)](./../verbs/verb-object-complement-you-make-me-nervous).

- *She **made everybody welcome**.*
- *The rain **made the grass wet**.* (not *~~The rain made wet the grass.~~*)

We do not use *make … be* in this structure.

- *You have **made me a happy man**.* (not *~~You have made me be a happy man.~~*)
