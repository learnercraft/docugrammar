# -ing forms after nouns and adjectives: *tired of listening*

## *the idea of getting old*; *tired of listening*

Some nouns and adjectives can be followed by *\-ing* forms. A preposition is normally used to connect the noun/adjective to the *\-ing* form. Nouns/adjectives that are followed by *\-ing* forms cannot usually be followed by infinitives ( [(see here)](./infinitives-or-ing-forms-both-possible-with-different-uses#attempt-intend-continue-cant-bear-be-accustomed-to-be-committed-to), [(see here)](./infinitives-or-ing-forms-both-possible-with-different-uses#afraid) for some exceptions with adjectives).

- *I hate the **idea of getting** old.* (not *~~… the idea to get old.~~*)
- *The **thought of failing** never entered his head.* (not *~~The thought to fail …~~*)
- *I’m **tired of listening** to this.* (not *~~I’m tired to listen …~~*)
- *She’s very **good at solving** problems.* (not *~~… good to solve …~~*)

Unfortunately, there is no easy way to decide which nouns and adjectives can be followed by *\-ing* forms. It is best to check in a good dictionary.

## Purpose: *a machine for cutting*

*For* + *\-ing* form can be used after a noun, or after an indefinite pronoun such as *something* or *anything*, to explain the purpose of an object or material – what it is for.

- *A strimmer is a **machine for cutting** grass and weeds.*
- *Have you got any **stuff for cleaning** silver?*
- *I need **something for killing** flies.*

This structure is mostly used to talk in general about types of object and material. When we talk about somebody’s purpose in using a particular object, we are more likely to use an infinitive [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/for-purpose-and-cause#the-purposes-of-things--ing-forms-and-infinitives).

- *I must find something **to kill** that fly.*

## *-ing* form or infinitive

After a few nouns and adjectives, we can use either an *\-ing* form or an infinitive. Normally there is little or no difference of meaning ( [(see here)](./infinitives-or-ing-forms-both-possible-with-different-uses#afraid) for some exceptions with adjectives).

- *We have a good **chance of making** / **to make** a profit.*
- *I’m **proud of having won** / **to have won**.*
