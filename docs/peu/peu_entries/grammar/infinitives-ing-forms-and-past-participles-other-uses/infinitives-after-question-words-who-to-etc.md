# Infinitives after question words: who to …, etc

## Indirect questions: *Tell us what to do.*

In indirect speech [(see here)](./../noun-clauses-direct-and-indirect-speech/indirect-speech-infinitives#he-asked-her-how-to-), we can use an infinitive after the question words *who*, *what*, *where*, etc (but not usually *why*). This structure expresses ideas such as obligation and possibility.

- *I wonder **who to invite**.* (= … who I should invite.)
- *Tell us **what to do**.*
- *Can you show me **how to get** to the station?* (= … how I can get to the station?)
- *I don’t know **where to put** the car.*
- *Tell me **when to pay**.*
- *I can’t decide **whether to answer** her email.*
- (but not *~~I can’t understand why to do it.~~*)

## Direct questions: *What shall we do?*

We do not usually begin a direct question with *How to …?, What to …?*, etc. After question words, we often use *shall* and *should*.

- ***How shall** I tell her?* (not *~~How to tell her?~~*)
- ***What shall** we do?* (not *~~What to do?~~*)
- ***Who should** I pay?* (not *~~Who to pay?~~*)

## Titles: *What to do if fire breaks out.*

*How to …*, *What to …*, etc are often found as titles for instructions, information leaflets, books, etc. (Note: these are not questions.)

- <code><em><strong>HOW TO IMPROVE</strong> YOUR PRONUNCIATION</em></code>
- <code><em><strong>WHAT TO DO</strong> IF FIRE BREAKS OUT</em></code>

For questions beginning *Why* (not) + infinitive, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/why-and-why-not).
