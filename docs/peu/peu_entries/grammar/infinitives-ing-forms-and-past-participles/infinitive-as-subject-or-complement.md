# Infinitive as subject or complement

## Subject: *To practise is important.* / *It’s important to practise.*

An infinitive (or a clause beginning with an infinitive) can be be the subject of a sentence.

- ***To practise regularly** is important.*
- ***To wait for people** who were late made him angry.*

In modern English, this is unusual, and especially unusual in an informal style. We more often use a structure with *it* [(see here)](./../information-structure/preparatory-it-subject).

- ***It**’s important **to practise regularly**.*
- ***It** made him angry **to wait for people who were late**.*

We can also use an *\-ing* structure at the beginning of a sentence as the subject, instead of an infinitive (clause) [(see here)](./ing-form-as-subject-object-or-complement).

- ***Selling insurance** is a boring job.* (More natural than *To sell insurance …*)

## Complement: *Your task is to get across the river.*

An infinitive (clause) can be used after *be* as a subject complement.

- *Your task is **to get across the river** without being seen.*
- *My ambition was **to retire at thirty**.*

Sentences like these can also be constructed with preparatory *it* [(see here)](./../information-structure/preparatory-it-subject).

- ***It** is your task **to get across the river** without being seen.*
- ***It** was my ambition **to retire at thirty**.*
