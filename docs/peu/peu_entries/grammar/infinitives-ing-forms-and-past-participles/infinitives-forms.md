# Infinitives: forms

Infinitives are most often used with *to* (e.g. ***to** go*, ***to** start*). For infinitives without *to*, [(see here)](./infinitives-without-to-i-saw-you-come-in). Besides simple infinitives, there are also progressive infinitives (e.g. *(to) be writing*), perfect infinitives (e.g. *(to) have written*), and passive infinitives (e.g. *(to) be written*).

## Progressive infinitive: *(to) be …ing*

Like other progressive forms [(see here)](./../verbs/progressive-structures), progressive infinitives suggest that situations are / were / will be continuing around the time that we are talking about.

- *It’s nice **to be sitting** here with you.*
- *I noticed that he seemed **to be smoking** a lot.*
- *This time tomorrow I’ll **be lying** on the beach.* (future progressive tense: [(see here)](./../talking-about-the-future/future-progressive)
- *Why’s she so late? She can’t still **be working**.*

## Perfect infinitive: *(to) have* + past participle

Perfect infinitives can have the same kind of meaning as perfect tenses [(see here)](./../verbs/perfect-structures) or past tenses ( [(see here)](./../past-and-perfect-tenses/simple-past).

- *It’s nice **to have finished** work for the day.* (= It’s nice that I have finished … )
- *I’m sorry not **to have come** on Thursday.* (= … that I didn’t come …)

We often use perfect infinitives to talk about ‘unreal’ past events: things that did not happen, or that may not have happened [(see here)](./use-of-perfect-infinitives-glad-to-have-left).

## Passive infinitive: *(to) be* + past participle

Passive infinitives have the same kind of meaning as other passive forms [(see here)](./../passives/passive-structures-and-verb-forms).

- *There’s a lot of work **to be done**.*
- *She ought **to be told** about it.*
- *That window must **be repaired** before tonight.*

Sometimes active and passive infinitives can have similar meanings, especially after a noun or *be* [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/active-and-passive-infinitive-with-similar-meaning).

- *There’s a lot of work **to do** / **to be done**.*

## Combinations: *to have been sitting*; *could have been killed*

Perfect progressive and perfect passive infinitives are common.

- *I’d like **to have been sitting** there when she walked in.*
- *They were lucky – they could **have been killed**.*

Progressive passive infinitives are possible but unusual.

- *‘What would you like to be doing right now?’ ‘I’d like **to be being massaged**.’*

Progressive perfect passive infinitives (e.g. *It must **have been being built** at the time*) are very unusual.

## Negative forms: *Try not to be late.*

Negative infinitives are normally made by putting *not* before the infinitive.

- *Try **not to be** late. (not usually *~~Try to not be late.~~*) or *~~Try to don’t be late.~~**
- *You were silly **not to have locked** your car.*
- *He’s very busy. I’m afraid he ca**n’t be disturbed**.*

## *to*

Note that the infinitive marker *to* (as in *He wanted **to** go*) is not a preposition. After the preposition *to* we use *\-ing* forms [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/ing-forms-after-prepositions-without-breaking-eggs#to-as-a-preposition-i-look-forward-to-ing).

For the use of *to* instead of a whole infinitive (e.g. *I’d like to*), [(see here)](./../information-structure/ellipsis-infinitives).

## Split infinitive: *to really understand*

A ‘split infinitive’ is a structure in which *to* is separated from the rest of the infinitive by an adverb.

- *I’d like **to really understand** philosophy.*
- *He began **to slowly get up** off the floor.*

Split infinitive structures are quite common in English, especially in an informal style. There is an old rule which says that split infinitives are incorrect. This is not true, but people who believe in the rule try to avoid split infinitives by putting the adverb in another position.

- *He began **slowly to get** up off the floor.*
