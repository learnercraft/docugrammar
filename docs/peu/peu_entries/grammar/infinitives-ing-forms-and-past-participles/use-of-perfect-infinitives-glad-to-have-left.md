# Use of perfect infinitives: *glad to have left*

## Perfect or past meaning

Perfect infinitives (*to have gone*, *to have left*, etc) can have the same kind of meaning as perfect or past tenses.

- *I’m glad **to have left** school at last.* (= I’m glad that I have left …)
- *She was sorry **to have missed** James.* (= … that she had missed James.)
- *We hope **to have finished** the job by next Saturday.* (= … that we will have finished …)

## Perfect infinitive for ‘unreal’ past

After some verbs (e.g. *mean*, *be*, *would like*), perfect infinitives can refer to ‘unreal’ past situations that are the opposite of what really happened.

- *I **meant to have telephoned**, but I forgot.* (or I meant to telephone …)
- *He **was to have been** the new ambassador, but he fell ill.*
- *I **would like to have seen** Harry’s face when Nadia walked in.*

With *would like*, *would prefer* and one or two other verbs, a double perfect infinitive is sometimes used in informal speech; the extra perfect infinitive does not change the meaning.

- *I **would have liked to have seen** Harry’s face.*

## Modals: *He could have killed himself.*

After the modal verbs *could*, *might*, *ought*, *should*, *would* and ***needn’t*** (BrE), perfect infinitives are also often used to refer to unreal situations.

- *Did you see him fall? He **could have killed** himself.* (He did not kill himself.)
- *You **should have called** – I was getting worried.* (The person did not call.)
- *I **would have gone** to university if my parents had had more money.*
- **She **needn’t have sent** me flowers.** (BrE) (She did send flowers.)

Modal verbs with perfect infinitives can also refer to situations that are not unreal, but uncertain.

- *She **could**/**should**/**ought to**/**may**/**will**/**must have arrived** by now.*
