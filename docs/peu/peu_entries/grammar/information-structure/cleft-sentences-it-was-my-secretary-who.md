# Cleft sentences: *It was my secretary who …*

We can emphasise particular words and expressions by putting everything into a kind of relative clause except the words we want to emphasise: this makes them stand out. These structures are called ‘cleft sentences’ by grammarians (*cleft* means ‘divided’). They are useful in writing (because we cannot use intonation for emphasis in written language), but they are also common in speech. The emphasis is often contrastive – to contradict a false belief or expectation.

## Preparatory *it*

In one kind of cleft sentence, we use preparatory *it is*/*was* [(see here)](./preparatory-it-subject). The words to be emphasised are usually joined to the relative clause by *that*.

Compare:

- *My secretary sent the bill to Mr Harding yesterday.*
- ***It was my secretary that** sent the bill to Mr Harding yesterday.* (not somebody else)
- ***It was the bill that** my secretary sent to Mr Harding yesterday.* (not something else)
- ***It was Mr Harding that** my secretary sent the bill to yesterday.* (not to somebody else)
- ***It was yesterday that** my secretary sent the bill to Mr Harding.* (not another day)

Negative structures are also possible.

- *It wasn’t my **husband that** sent the bill …*

*Who* is possible instead of *that* when a personal subject is emphasised.

- *It was my secretary **who** sent …*

When a plural subject is emphasised, the following verb is plural (but *it is*/*was* remains singular).

- *It **is** the students that **are** angry.* (not *~~… that is angry.~~*)
- *It **was** his parents who **paid** the fees.* (not *~~It were his parents …~~*)

The verb cannot be emphasised with this structure: we cannot say *~~It was sent that my secretary the bill~~*.

Nor can a complement be emphasised: we cannot say *~~It’s Jenny that Mr Harding’s secretary is.~~*

## *It is I who …* ; *It is me that …*

When an emphasised subject is a pronoun, there are two possibilities. Compare:

- *It is **I who am** responsible.* (formal)  
  *It’s **me that’s/who’s** responsible.* (informal)
- *It is **you who are** in the wrong.* (formal)  
  *It’s **you that’s** in the wrong.* (informal)

To avoid being either too formal or too informal in this case, we could say, for example, *I’m the person / the one who’s responsible*.
