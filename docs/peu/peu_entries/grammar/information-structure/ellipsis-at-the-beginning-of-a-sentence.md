# Ellipsis at the beginning of a sentence

## Words that can be left out

In informal spoken English we often leave out unstressed words at the beginning of a sentence if the meaning is clear without them. Words that can be left out include articles (*the*, *a/an*), possessives (*my, your*, etc), personal pronouns (*I, you*, etc), auxiliary verbs (*am*, *have*, etc) and the preparatory subject *there*.

- *Car’s running badly.* (= The car’s …)
- *Wife’s away.* (= My wife’s …)
- *Couldn’t understand a word.* (= I couldn’t …)
- *Must dash.* (= I must dash.)
- *Won’t work, you know.* (= It won’t work …)
- *Seen Joe?* (= Have you seen Joe?)
- *Keeping well, I hope?* (= You’re keeping well …)
- *Nobody at home.* (= There’s nobody at home.)
- *Careful what you say.* (= Be careful …)
- *Catch up with you later.* (= I’ll catch up …)
- *Leave at half past?* (= Should we leave …?)
- *Soon as I wake up, I check my messages.* (= As soon as …)

This structure is common in advertisements. Two real examples:

- *Thinking of postgraduate study? Call for a place now.* (= Are you thinking …?)
- *Speak a foreign language? Speak it better.* (= Do you speak …?)

## Unstressed forms of *be*, *will*, *would*, *have*

We do not usually drop words so as to begin sentences with unstressed forms of *be*, *will*, *would* or auxiliary *have* (though this sometimes happens in messages, diary entries and other kinds of very informal writing).

- ***I’m coming** tomorrow.* or ***Coming** tomorrow.* (not *~~Am coming tomorrow.~~* *Am* is not stressed.)
- ***I’ll see** you soon.* or ***See** you soon.* (not *~~Will see you soon.~~* *Will* is not stressed.)
- ***Haven’t** seen him.* (but not *~~Have seen him.~~* *Have* is not stressed.)

## Before pronouns: *You ready?*

Auxiliary verbs can be left out before personal pronouns except *I* and *it*.

- ***You** ready?* (= Are you ready?)
- ***She** want something?* (= Does she want something?)
- but not *~~I late?~~* *~~It raining?~~*

## *Dutch, aren’t you?*

Ellipsis is very common in sentences that have some sort of tag ( [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/question-tags-basic-information), [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/spoken-sentence-structure) on the end, especially in British English.

- *Can’t swim, **myself**.*
- *Like a cigar, **I do**.*
- *Dutch, **aren’t you**?*
- *Getting in your way, **am I**?*
- *Going camping, **your kids**?*
