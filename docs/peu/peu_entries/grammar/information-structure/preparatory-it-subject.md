# Preparatory it: subject

## *It’s nice to talk to you.*

When the subject of a clause is an infinitive expression, this does not normally come at the beginning. We usually prefer to start with the ‘**preparatory subject**’ *it*, and to put the infinitive expression later (long or complicated items are often put towards the end of a sentence, [(see here)](./information-structure-normal-order-and-variations). Preparatory *it* is common before *be* + adjective/noun.

- ***It’s** nice **to talk** to you.* (More natural than *To talk to you is nice*.)
- ***It** was good of you **to phone**.*
- ***It** was stupid of you **to leave** the door unlocked.*
- ***It’s** important **to reserve** in advance.*
- ***It’s** my ambition **to run** a three-hour marathon.*
- ***It** was a pleasure **to listen** to her.*
- ***It** upsets me **to hear** people arguing all the time.*

*It* can also be a preparatory subject for *for* + object + infinitive [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-other-uses/for-to).

- ***It** will suit me best **for you to arrive** at about ten o’clock.*
- ***It’s** essential **for the papers to be** ready before Thursday.*

## *It’s probable that we’ll be late.*

We also use preparatory *it* when the subject of a clause is itself a clause beginning with *that*, *what*, *how*, etc.

- ***It’s** probable **that we’ll be a little late**.*
- ***It** doesn’t interest me **what you think**.*
- ***It’s** surprising **how many unhappy marriages there are**.*
- ***It’s** exciting **when a baby starts talking**.*

## *It was nice seeing you.*

*It* can be a preparatory subject for an *\-ing* form. This is usually informal.

- ***It** was nice **seeing** you.*
- ***It’s** crazy her **going** off like that.*
- ***It’s** worth **going** to Wales if you have the time.*
- ***It’s** no use **trying** to explain – I’m not interested.*
- ***It** surprised me you not **remembering** my name.*

For *there* as a preparatory subject with *any*/*no use*, [(see here)](./../be-have-and-do/there-is#indefinite-subjects).

## *It takes …* + infinitive

Note the common use of this structure to say how much time is necessary [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/take-time).

- ***It took** me months to get to know her.*
- *How long does **it take** to get to London from here?*

## *if*, *as if* and *as though*

*It* is used to introduce some clauses with *if*, *as if* and *as though*.

- ***It** looks **as if** we’re going to have trouble with Anna again.*
- ***It’s** not **as if** this was the first time she’s been difficult.*
- ***It** will be a pity **if** we have to ask her to leave.*
- *But **it** looks **as though** we may have to.*

## *It’s amazing the way they work together.*

*It* is not normally used as a preparatory subject for noun phrases.

- *The new concert hall is wonderful.* (not *~~It’s wonderful the new concert hall.~~*)

But in an informal style, *it* can be a preparatory subject for noun + relative clause.

- ***It’s** wonderful **the enthusiasm that the children show**.*

This is very common with *the way …*

- ***It’s** amazing **the way (that) they work together**.*
- ***It’s** strange **the way you know what I’m thinking**.*

## Preparatory it not possible for complements

*It* can be used as a preparatory subject, or as a preparatory object [(see here)](./preparatory-it-object), but not as a preparatory complement.

- *This chair is comfortable **to sit on**.* ``but not`` *~~It is comfortable to sit on this chair.~~* (*to sit on* is the complement of *comfortable*.)
- *The impression was given **that travel expenses would be paid**.* ``but not`` *~~It was given the impression that travel expenses would be paid.~~* (*that travel expenses …* is the complement of the *impression*.)
