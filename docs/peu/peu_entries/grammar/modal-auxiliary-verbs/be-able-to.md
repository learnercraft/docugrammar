# *be able to*

We use *able* especially in the structure *be able to* + infinitive. This often has the same meaning as *can* [(see here)](./ability-can-and-could). There is a negative form *unable*.

- *Some people **are able to** / **can** walk on their hands.*
- *I **am unable to** / **can’t** understand what she wants.*

*Can* is preferred in the sense of ‘know how to’, and in expressions like *can see*, *can hear*, etc [(see here)](./can-and-could-with-see-hear-etc).

- ***Can** you knit?* (More natural than *Are you able to knit?*)
- *I **can see** a ship.* (More natural than *I am able to see a ship.*)

*Be able to* is used most often for people or other living things. Compare:

- *Jake **can lift / is able to lift** 150 kilos.*
- *This crane **can lift** 30 tonnes.* (More natural than *This crane is able to lift 30 tonnes.*)

*Be able to* is used in cases (e.g. future, present perfect) where *can*/*could* is not grammatically possible because it has no infinitive or participles [(see here)](./modals-grammar-pronunciation-and-contractions#grammar).

- *One day scientists **will be able** to find a cure for cancer.* (not *~~… will can find …~~*)
- *What **have** you **been able** to find out?* (not *~~What have you could …?~~*)
- *I **might be able** to help you.* (not *~~I might can …~~*)

*Able* is not often followed by passive infinitives.

- *He **can’t be understood**.* (More natural than *He’s not able to be understood.*)

For differences between *could* and *was able to*, [(see here)](./ability-can-and-could#past-could-is-not-always-possible), [(see here)](./ability-advanced-points#could-in-the-past).
