# Deduction (deciding that something is certain): *must*, *can’t*, etc

## Statements: *Emily must have a problem.*

*Must* can be used to express the deduction or conclusion that something is certain or highly probable: it is normal or logical, there are excellent reasons for believing it, or it is the only possible explanation for what is happening.

- *If A is bigger than B, and B is bigger than C, then A **must** be bigger than C.*
- *‘I’m in love.’ ‘You **must** be very happy.’*
- *Emily **must** have a problem – she keeps crying.*
- *There’s the doorbell. It **must** be George.*

*Have (got) to* is also possible in this sense.

- *There’s the doorbell. It **has to** be George.*
- *Getting married next week? You **have to** be joking.*
- *Only five o’clock? It’**s got to** be later than that!*

## Negatives: *It can’t be Emily.*

*Must* is not often used to express certainty in negative clauses. We normally use *cannot/can’t* to say that something is certainly not the case, because it is logically or practically impossible, or extremely improbable.

- *If A is bigger than B, and B is bigger than C, then C **can’t** be bigger than A.*
- *It **can’t** be Emily at the door. She’s in Ireland.* (not *~~It mustn’t be Emily …~~*)
- *She’s not answering the phone. She **can’t** be at home.*

However, *mustn’t* is used in question tags ( [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/question-tags-basic-information) after *must*, especially in British English.

- *It **must** be nice to be a cat, **mustn’t** it?* (not *~~… can’t it?~~*)

And *must not* is occasionally used, especially in American English, to say that there is evidence that something is not the case ([see below](#a-british-american-difference-cant-and-must-not)).

## *need not / does not have to*

*Need not / needn’t* is used (especially in British English) to say that something is not necessarily so; *does not have to* can also be used. *Must not* is not used in this sense.

- *‘Look at those tracks. That **must** be a dog.’ ‘It **needn’t** be – it could be a fox.’* (or … It **doesn’t have to** be …) (not *~~… It mustn’t be …~~*)

## *That must have been nice.*

We can use *must have* + past participle to express certainty about the past.

- *‘We went to Rome last month.’ ‘That **must have been** nice.’*
- *‘A woman phoned while you were out.’ ‘It **must have been** Kate.’*

*Can* is used in questions and negatives.

- *Where **can** Jack **have put** the matches? He **can’t have thrown** them away.*

## *will*

*Will* can express certainty or confidence about present or future situations.

- *As I’m sure you **will** understand, we cannot wait any longer for our order.*
- *Don’t phone them now – they’**ll** be having dinner.*
- *‘There’s somebody coming up the stairs.’ ‘That’**ll** be Emily.’*
- *Tomorrow **will** be cloudy, with some rain.*

*Will have* + past participle refers to the past.

- *Dear Sir, You **will** recently **have received** a form …*
- *We can’t go and see them now – they’**ll have gone** to bed.*

## Indirect speech

*Must* can be used in past indirect speech as if it were a past tense.

- *I felt there **must** be something wrong.*

## *must* and *should*

*Should* can be used as a weaker form of *must* [(see here)](./deduction-deciding-that-something-is-probable-should-ought-to-etc). Compare:

- *Anna **must** be at home by now.* (= I’m certain she’s at home.)
- *Anna **should** be at home by now.* (= I think she’s very probably at home.)

## A British-American difference: *can’t* and *must not*

In American English, *must not* is often used when something is not logically impossible, but when there is strong evidence for believing that it is not the case. Compare:

- *He only left the office five minutes ago. He **can’t** be home yet.* (It’s logically impossible that he’s home.)  
  *She’s not answering the doorbell. She **must not** be at home.* (It’s not logically impossible that she’s home, but it seems pretty certain that she isn’t.)
- *The restaurant **can’t** be open – the door’s locked.*  
  *That restaurant **must not** be any good – it’s always empty.*

In British English, *can’t* is normal for both meanings (though some people use *must not* for the ‘seems pretty certain’ meaning). Compare:

- *She walked past without saying ‘Hello’. She **must not** have seen you.* (AmE; some British speakers.)
- *She walked past without saying ‘Hello’. She **can’t** have seen you.* (most British speakers.)

Note that the contracted form *mustn’t* is rare in AmE.

## *must*: not used for predictions

*Must* is not often used for predictions about the future – to say what people expect to happen. *Will* is used to express certainty [(see here)](./../talking-about-the-future/will); *should* or *ought to* suggest that things are probable [(see here)](./deduction-deciding-that-something-is-probable-should-ought-to-etc).

- *It **will** be fine tomorrow.* (not *~~It must be fine tomorrow.~~*)  
  *Next week’s exam **should**/**ought to** be easy.* (not *~~Next week’s exam must be easy.~~*)
