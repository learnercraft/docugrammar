# Instructions and requests: *will*, *would*, *can*, *could*, *might*, *shall*

## Instructions, requests and suggestions: *will*, *would*, *can*, *could*, *might*

We can use *will you …?* to tell people to do things. *Would you …?* is less direct and more polite.

- ***Will you** get me a newspaper while you’re out?*
- ***Will you** be quiet, please!*
- *Make me a cup of coffee, **will you**?*
- ***Would you** open a window, please?*

*If you will/would …* can be used in polite requests.

- ***If you’ll** just wait here for a moment, I’ll see if Mr Andrews is free.*
- ***If you would** come this way …*

*Can* and *could* are used to give instructions or make requests. *Could* is less direct and more polite.

- ***Can** you put the children to bed?*
- ***Could** you lend me £5 until tomorrow?*
- *Do you think you **could** help me for a few minutes?*

*Could* and *might* are often used in suggestions.

- *When you’ve finished the dishes you **could** iron the clothes, if you like.*
- *If you don’t know what to do, you **could** sort out your photos.*
- *You **might** see if John’s free this evening.*

## Asking for instructions and decisions: *shall*

Questions with *shall I/we* are used (in both British and American English) to ask for instructions or decisions, to offer services, and to make suggestions. In American English, this is rather formal. *Will* is not used in this way.

- ***Shall I** open a window?* (not *~~Will I open a window?~~*)
- ***Shall I** carry your bag?*
- *What time **shall we** come and see you?*
- *What on earth **shall we** do?*
- ***Shall we** go out for a meal?*
- *Let’s go and see Lucy, **shall we**?*

## Criticisms: *You could have told me …*

*Could* and *might* can be used to criticise people for not doing things.

- *You **could** ask before you borrow my car.*
- *You **might** try to be nicer to my mother.*

*Could/might have …* + past participle can be used in criticisms about past behaviour.

- *You **could have told** me you were getting married.*
- *She **might have warned** us she was going to stay out all night.*
