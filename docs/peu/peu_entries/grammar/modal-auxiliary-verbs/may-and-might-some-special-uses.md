# *may* and *might*: some special uses

## *may* in wishes and hopes

*May* (but not *might*) is used in formal expressions of wishes and hopes.

- *I hope that the young couple **may** enjoy many years of happiness together.*
- *Let us pray that peace **may** soon return to our troubled land.*

*May* often comes at the beginning of the sentence.

- ***May** you both be very happy!*
- ***May** God be with you.*
- ***May** the New Year bring you all your heart desires.*
- ***May** she rest in peace.* (prayer for a dead person)

## *may/might … but*

*May* (and sometimes *might*) can be used in a discussion rather like *although* or *even if*: to say that something is true, but that this makes no difference to the main argument. They are often followed by *but*.

- *He **may** be clever, but he hasn’t got much common sense.* (= Even if he’s clever, he … ``OR`` Although he’s clever, he …)
- *It **may** be a comfortable car, but it uses a lot of fuel.*
- *She **might** have had a lovely voice when she was younger, but …*

Note that in this structure, *may* and *might* can be used to talk about things that are definitely true, not just possible.

- *You **may** be my boss, but that doesn’t mean you’re better than me.*

## *may/might as well*

This structure is used informally to suggest that one should do something because there is nothing better, nothing more interesting or nothing more useful to do. There is little difference between *may* and *might* in this case.

- *There’s nobody interesting to talk to. We **may as well** go home.*
- *‘Shall we go and see Fred?’ ‘OK, **might as well**.’*

Note the difference between *may/might* *as well* and *had better* [(see here)](./weaker-obligation-had-better). Compare:

- *We **may as well** eat.* (= There is nothing more interesting to do.)
- *We’**d better** eat.* (= We ought to eat; there is a good reason to eat.)

*Might as well* is also used to compare one unpleasant situation with another.

- *This trip isn’t much fun. We **might** just **as well** be back home.* (= Things wouldn’t be any different if we were at home.)
- *You never listen – I **might as well** talk to a brick wall.*
