# *that*-clauses

## *that* as a connector

*That* is a conjunction with little real meaning. It simply functions as a connector – it shows that a clause forms part of a larger sentence. Compare:

- *I understood. He was innocent.* (two separate sentences)
- *I understood **that** he was innocent.* (The clause *he was innocent* has become the object of the verb in the larger sentence.)

## *that*-clauses in sentences

A *that*\-clause can be the subject of a sentence. (This is very formal and unusual.)

- ***That she should forget me so quickly** was rather a shock.*

It can be a complement after *be*.

- *The main thing is **that you’re happy**.*

Many verbs can have *that*\-clauses as objects.

- *We **knew that** the next day would be difficult.*
- *I **regretted that** I was not going to be at the meeting.*

And many nouns and adjectives can be followed by *that*\-clauses.

- *I admire your **belief that** you are always right.*
- *The Minister is **anxious that** nothing should get into the papers.*

## *the fact that …*

It is unusual for *that*\-clauses to stand alone as subjects. They are more often introduced by the expression *the fact*.

- ***The fact that** she was foreign made it difficult for her to get a job.* (not *~~That she was foreign made it difficult …~~*)
- ***The fact that** Simon had disappeared didn’t seem to worry anybody.* (More natural than *That Simon had disappeared didn’t …*)

*The fact* also introduces *that*\-clauses after prepositions (*that*\-clauses cannot follow prepositions directly).

- *The judge paid no attention **to the fact that** she had just lost her husband.* (not *~~… paid no attention to that she had just …~~*)
- *He held her completely responsible **for the fact that** she took food without paying for it.* (not *~~… responsible for that she took …~~*)
- *In spite **of the fact that** she had three small children, he sent her to prison for six months.* (not *~~In spite of that she had …~~*)

For cases when prepositions are dropped before *that*\-clauses, [(see here)](./../prepositions/prepositions-before-conjunctions).

## Preparatory *it*

*It* is often used as a preparatory subject or object for a *that*\-clause ( [(see here)](./../information-structure/preparatory-it-subject).

- ***It** surprised me **that he was still in bed**.* (More natural than *That he was still in bed surprised me.*)
- *She made **it** clear **that she was not interested**.* (not *~~She made that she was not interested clear.~~*)

:::note

For reasons why *that*\-clauses are often moved to the ends of sentences, [(see here)](./../information-structure/information-structure-normal-order-and-variations).

## *that*-clauses after verbs, nouns and adjectives

Some verbs, nouns or adjectives can be followed by *that*\-clauses; some cannot. Compare:

- *I **hope that** you will have a wonderful time.*  
  *I want you to have a wonderful time.* (not *~~I want that you’ll have …~~*)
- *I understood his **wish that** we should be there.*  
  *I understood the importance of our being there.* (not *~~… the importance that we should be there.~~*)
- *It’s **essential that** you visit the art museum.*  
  *It’s worth your visiting the art museum.* (not *~~It’s worth that you visit …~~*)

Unfortunately, there is no easy way to decide which nouns, verbs or adjectives can be followed by *that*\-clauses. It is best to check in a good dictionary.

## Should in that-clauses: It’s important that … should

In formal British English, *should* can be used in *that*\-clauses after adjectives and nouns expressing the importance of an action (e.g. *important*, *necessary*, *vital*, *essential*, *eager*, *anxious*, *concerned*, *wish*).

- *It’s **important** that somebody **should** talk to the police.*
- *Is it **necessary** that my uncle **should** be informed?*
- *I’m **anxious** that nobody **should** be hurt.*
- *It is his **wish** that the money **should** be given to charity.*

This also happens after some verbs expressing similar ideas, especially in sentences about the past.

- *He **insisted** that the contract **should** be read aloud.*
- *I **recommended** that she **should** reduce her expenditure.*

In a less formal style, other structures are preferred.

- *It’s **important** that she **talks** to me when she gets here.*
- *Was it **necessary to tell** my uncle?*

In American English, this use of *should* is unusual; subjunctives may be used [(see here)](./../conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/subjunctive-that-she-go-that-they-be-if-i-were-etc).

- *It’s important that somebody **talk** to the police.*
- *Was it necessary that my uncle **be** informed?*
- *I recommend that she **reduce** her expenditure.*

## Should in *that*-clauses: *It’s surprising that … should*

*Should* is also used in subordinate clauses after words expressing personal judgements and reactions, especially to facts which are already known or have already been mentioned. (This use, too, is more common in British than American English. It is not particularly formal.)

- *It’s **surprising** that she **should** say that to you.*
- *I was **shocked** that she **shouldn’t** have invited Phyllis.*
- *I’m **sorry** you **should** think I did it on purpose.*
- *Do you think it’s **normal** that the child **should** be so tired?*

In American English, *would* is more usual in this kind of sentence.

- *It was *natural* that they *would* want him to go to a good school.* (BrE *… that they should …*)

Sentences like these can also be constructed without *should*. Subjunctives cannot be used.

- *It’s **surprising** that she **says**/**said** that sort of thing to you.* (but not *~~It’s surprising that she say …~~*)
- *I was **shocked** that she **didn’t** invite Phyllis.*

## Who do you wish (that) you’d married?

A *wh-* question usually refers to the main clause which starts with the question word. However, questions can also refer to subordinate *that*\-clauses after verbs like *wish*, *think* or *say*.

- *Who do you wish **(that) you’d married**, then?*
- *How long do you think **(that) we should wait**?*
- *What did you say **(that) you wanted** for Christmas?*

*That* is usually dropped in cases like these; it must be dropped when the question word refers to the subject of the subordinate clause.

- ***Who** do you think **is outside?*** (not *~~Who do you think that is outside?~~*)
- ***What** do you suppose **will happen now**?* (not *~~What do you suppose that will happen now?~~*)

## Compound conjunctions

Some conjunctions are made up of two or more words, including *that*. Common examples: *so that*, *in order that*, *provided that*, *providing that*, *seeing that*, *given that*, *now that*.

- *I got here early **so that** we could have a few minutes alone together.*
- *I’ll come with you **providing that** James doesn’t mind.*
- *OK, I’ll help you, **seeing that** you asked so nicely.*
- ***Given that** I’m free on Monday, we could go to Scotland for the weekend.*
