# Countable and uncountable nouns: basic information

## The difference

**Countable** nouns are the names of separate objects, people, ideas, etc, which can be counted. We can use numbers and the article *a/an* with countable nouns; they have plurals.

- *a cat*
- *a newspaper*
- *three cats*
- *two newspapers*

**Uncountable** (or **mass**) nouns are the names of materials, liquids, abstract qualities, collections and other things which we see as masses without clear boundaries, and not as separate objects. Some examples:

- *oil*  
- *oxygen*
- *baggage*
- *crockery*
- *jewellery*
- *underwear*  
- *water*
- *plastic*
- *clothing*
- *equipment*
- *luggage*
- *weather*
- *steel*
- *granite*
- *cutlery*
- *furniture*
- *machinery*

We cannot use numbers with uncountable nouns, and most are singular with no plurals. We do not normally use *a/an* with uncountable nouns, though there are some exceptions [(see here)](./countable-and-uncountable-nouns-advanced-points#aan-with-uncountable-nouns-a-first-class-knowledge).

- *clear water* (not *~~a clear water, two clear waters~~*)
- *pure wool* (not *~~a pure wool, two pure wools~~*)
- *bad weather* (not *~~a bad weather, three bad weathers~~*)

Some determiners can only be used with countable nouns (e.g. *many*, *few*); others can only be used with uncountables (e.g. *much*, *little*). Compare:

- *How **many hours** do you work?*
- *How **much money** do you earn?*

Note that very many nouns are not simply countable or uncountable: they have countable or uncountable **uses** ( [(see here)](./countable-and-uncountable-nouns-basic-information#materials-glass-paper-etc) below).

## Problems

Usually it is easy to see whether a noun is countable or uncountable. Obviously *house* is normally a countable noun, and *water* is not. But it is not always so clear: compare *a journey* (countable) and *travel* (uncountable); *a glass* (countable) and *glass* (uncountable); *vegetables* (countable) and *fruit* (uncountable). The following rules will help, but to know exactly how a particular noun can be used, it is necessary to check in a good dictionary.

## *travel* and *a journey*; *a piece of advice*

*Travel* and *journey* have very similar meanings, but *travel* is normally uncountable (it means ‘travelling in general’, and we do not talk about ‘a travel’), while *journey* is countable (*a journey* is one particular movement from one place to another) and can have a plural: *journeys*.

- *I like **travel**, but it’s often tiring.*
- *Did you have **a** good **journey**?*

Often we can make an uncountable word countable by putting *a piece of* or a similar expression in front of it.

- *He never listens to **advice**.*
- *Can I give you **a piece of advice**?*

Here are some other examples of general–particular pairs. (Note that some words that are uncountable in English have countable equivalents in other languages.)

| Uncountable | Countable |
| --- | --- |
| *accommodation* | *a place to live* (not ~~*an accommodation*~~) |
| *baggage* | *a piece/item of baggage; a case/trunk/bag* |
| *bread* | *a piece/slice/loaf of bread; a loaf; a roll* |
| *chess* | *a game of chess* |
| *chewing gum* | *a piece of chewing gum* (not ~~*a chewing gum*~~) |
| *equipment* | *a piece of equipment; a tool*, etc |
| *furniture* | *a piece/article of furniture; a table, chair*, etc |
| *information* | *a piece of information* |
| *knowledge* | *a fact* |
| *lightning* | *a flash of lightning* |
| *luck* | *a piece/bit/stroke of luck* |
| *luggage* | *a piece/item of luggage; a case/trunk/bag* |
| *money* | *a note; a coin; a sum of money* |
| *news* | *a piece of news* |
| *poetry* | *a poem* |
| *progress* | *a step forward; an advance* |
| *publicity* | *an advertisement* |
| *research* | *a piece of research; a study; an experiment* |
| *rubbish* | *a piece of rubbish* |
| *slang* | *a slang word/expression* |
| *thunder* | *a clap of thunder* |
| *traffic* | *cars*, etc |
| *vocabulary* | *a word; an expression* |
| *work* | *a piece of work; a job* |

Note that some English uncountable nouns or *\-ing* forms may be borrowed into other languages and turned into countable nouns. This happens, for instance, with *parking*: in English it means the activity of parking in general; French uses *un parking* to mean ‘a car park’. The same has happened with *training* and *planning* (used in several other languages, but not usually in English, to mean ‘training session/course’ and ‘planning operation/meeting’ respectively).

## Materials: *glass*, *paper*, etc

Words for materials are uncountable, but we can often use the same word as a countable noun to refer to something made of the material. Compare:

- *I’d like some typing **paper**.*  
  *I’m going out to buy **a paper*** (= a newspaper)
- *The window’s made of unbreakable **glass**.*  
  *Would you like **a glass** of water?*

Nouns for materials, liquids, etc can be countable when they are used to talk about different types.

- *Not all washing **powders** are kind to your hands.*
- *We have a selection of fine **wines** at very good prices.*

The same thing happens when we talk about ordering drinks. Compare:

- *Have you got **any coffee**?*
- *Could I have **two coffees**?* (= cups of coffee)

## *fruit*, *rice*, *wheat*, *spaghetti*, *hair*; *vegetables*, *peas*, *grapes*

Many things (e.g. *rice*, *grapes*) can be seen either as a collection of separate elements or as a mass. Some names for things of this kind are uncountable, while others are countable (usually plural). Things that come in small grains (e.g. *sand*, *rice*) are usually uncountable; collections made of larger grain-like things (e.g. *peas*, *grapes*) are more often countable. But the difference is not very systematic: compare *gravel* and *pebbles*. Note that some words of this kind (e.g. *grapes*) may be countable in English and uncountable in certain other languages.

 **Uncountable**: *fruit*, *rice*, *spaghetti*, *macaroni* (and other pasta foods), *sugar*, *salt*, *corn*, *wheat*, *barley*, *rye*, *maize*, *gravel*.

**Countable**: *vegetable(s)*, *bean(s)*, *pea(s)*, *grape(s)*, *lentil(s)*, *pebble(s)*.

- ***Fruit is** very expensive, but **vegetables are** cheap.*
- ***Is** the **spaghetti** ready?*
- *These **grapes are** sour.*

*Hair* is normally uncountable in English.

- *His **hair is** black.*

But one strand of hair is *a hair* (countable).

- *So why has he got **two** blonde **hairs** on his jacket?*

For words that are used to talk about one ‘piece’ of uncountable collections (e.g. *a grain of corn*, *a blade of grass*), [(see here)](./piece-and-group-words-a-blade-of-grass-a-bunch-of-flowers).

## Abstract nouns: *time*, *life*, *experience*, etc

Many abstract nouns can have both uncountable and countable uses, often corresponding to more ‘general’ and more ‘particular’ meanings. Compare:

- *Don’t hurry – there’s plenty of **time**.*  
  *Have **a** good **time**.*
  *There are **times** when I just want to stop work.*
- ***Life** is complicated.*  
  *He’s had **a** really difficult **life**.*
- *She hasn’t got enough **experience** for the job.*  
  *I had some strange **experiences** last week.*
- *It’s hard to feel **pity** for people like that.*  
  *It’s **a pity** it’s raining.*
- *Your plan needs more **thought**.*  
  *I had some frightening **thoughts** in the night.*
- *I need to practise **conversation**.*  
  *Megan and I had **a** very interesting **conversation**.*

## Illnesses

The names of illnesses are usually singular uncountable in English, including those ending in *\-s*.

- *If you’ve already had **measles**, you can’t get **it** again.*
- *There **is** a lot of **flu** around at the moment.*

The words for some minor ailments are countable: e.g. *a cold*, *a sore throat*, *a headache*. However, *toothache*, *earache*, *stomach ache* and *backache* are usually uncountable in British English. In American English, these words are generally countable if they refer to particular attacks of pain. Compare:

- *I’ve got **toothache**.* (BrE)
- *I have **a toothache**.* (AmE)
