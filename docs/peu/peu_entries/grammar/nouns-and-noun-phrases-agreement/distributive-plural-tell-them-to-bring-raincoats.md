# Distributive plural: *Tell them to bring raincoats.*

## People doing the same thing

To talk about several people each doing the same thing, English usually prefers a plural noun for the repeated idea.

- *Tell the kids to bring **raincoats** to school tomorrow.* (More natural than *Tell the kids to bring a raincoat …*)

Plural forms are almost always used in this case if there are possessives.

- *Tell the children to blow **their noses**.* (not *~~… to blow their nose.~~*)
- *Six people lost **their lives** in the accident.*

Uncountable nouns cannot of course be used in the plural.

- *They were all anxious to increase their **knowledge**.* (not *~~… their knowledges.~~*)

## Repeated events

In descriptions of repeated single events, singular and plural nouns are both possible. When no details are given, plural nouns are more natural.

- *I often get **headaches**.* (More natural than *I often get a headache.*)
- *She sometimes goes for **rides** over the hills.*

When details of the time or situation are given, nouns are often singular.

- *I often get **a headache** when I’ve been working on the computer.*
- *She often goes for **a ride** over the hills before supper.*

Singular nouns may also be used to avoid misunderstanding.

- *I sometimes throw **a stone** into the river and wish for good luck.* (clearer than *I sometimes throw stones …* – only one stone is thrown each time)

To refer to the time of repeated events, both singular and plural expressions are often possible with little difference of meaning.

- *We usually go and see my mother on **Saturday(s)**.*
- *He’s not at his best in the **morning(s)**.*

## Generalisations and rules

In generalisations and rules, singular and plural nouns are both possible.

- *We use **a past participle** in **a perfect verb form**.* (or We use **past participles** in **perfect verb forms**.)
- *All documents must be accompanied by **a translation** of the **original**.* (or *All documents must be accompanied by **translations** of the **originals**.*)

Mixtures of singular and plural are possible.

- ***Subjects** agree with their **verb**.*
- ***Children** may resemble both their **father** and their **mother** in different ways.*

This often happens with fixed singular expressions like *at the beginning*.

- *Discourse **markers** often come **at the beginning** of **sentences**.*
