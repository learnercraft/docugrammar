# Irregular and special plurals

## Irregular plurals in *-ves*

The following nouns ending in *\-f(e)* have plurals in *\-ves*.

| Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- |
| *cal**f*** | *cal**ves*** |
| *el**f*** | *el**ves*** |
| *hal**f*** | *hal**ves*** |
| *kni**fe*** | *kni**ves*** |

| *shel**f*** | *shel**ves*** |
| *thie**f*** | *thie**ves*** |
| *wi**fe*** | *wi**ves*** |
| *wol**f*** | *wol**ves*** |

*Dwarf*, *hoof*, *scarf* and *wharf* can have plurals in either *\-fs* or *\-ves*. *Hooves*, *scarves* and *wharves* are more common than the plurals in *\-fs*.

Other words ending in *\-f(e)* have regular plurals, for example *roofs*, *beliefs*, *safes*.

## Other irregular plurals

| Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- |
| *child* | *child**ren*** |
| *foot* | *f**ee**t* |
| *goose* | *g**ee**se* |
| *louse* | *l**ic**e* |
| *man* | *m**e**n* |
| *mouse* | *m**ic**e* |
| *ox* | *ox**en*** |
| *penny* | *pen**ce*** |
| *person* | *people* |
| *tooth* | *t**ee**th* |
| *woman* | *wom**e**n* |

The regular plural *pennies* can be used to talk about separate penny coins (and one-cent coins in the USA); *pence* is used to talk about prices and sums of money. Some British people now use *pence* as a singular (e.g. *That’ll be three pounds and one **pence**, please*).

*Persons* is sometimes used as a plural of *person* in official language. There is also a singular noun *people* (plural *peoples*) meaning ‘nation’.

## Plural same as singular

Some words ending in *\-s* do not change in the plural. Common examples:

| Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- |
| *barracks* | *barracks* |
| *crossroads* | *crossroads* |
| *headquarters* | *headquarters* |
| *means* | *means* |
| *series* | *series* |
| *species* | *species* |
| *Swiss* | *Swiss* |
| *works* (= factory) | *works* |

Note that some singular uncountable nouns end in *\-s*. These have no plurals. Examples are *news*, *billiards*, *draughts* (and some other names of games ending in *\-s*), *measles* (and some other illnesses).

- *Here **is** the news.* (not *~~Here are the news.~~*)

Most words ending in *\-ics* (e.g. *mathematics*, *physics*, *athletics*) are normally singular uncountable and have no plural use.

- *Too **much mathematics** is usually taught in schools.* (not *~~Too many mathematics are …~~*)

Some words ending in *\-ics* (e.g. *politics*, *statistics*) can also have plural uses.

- ***Politics is** a complicated business.* (but *What *are* your *politics*?*)
- ***Statistics is** useful in language testing.* (but *The unemployment *statistics are* disturbing.*)

Other nouns which do not change in the plural are *craft* (meaning ‘vehicle’), *aircraft*, *hovercraft*, *spacecraft*, *Chinese*, *Japanese* (and other nationality nouns ending in *\-ese*), *sheep*, *deer*, *fish*, and the names of some other living creatures, especially those that are hunted or used for food. *Fish* has a rare plural *fishes*, but the normal plural is *fish*.

*Dozen*, *hundred*, *thousand*, *million*, *stone* (= 14 pounds) and *foot* (= 12 inches) have plurals without *\-s* in some kinds of expressions. For details, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/vocabulary-areas/numbers#five-hundred-etc-without--s).

*Dice* (used in board games) is originally the plural of an old noun *die*. In modern English it is used as both singular and plural.

*Data* is originally the plural of *datum*, which is not now used. In modern English *data* can be used either as an uncountable noun (*this data is …*) or as a plural (*these data are …*), with no difference of meaning. The uncountable use is more common in modern English.

*Media* is originally the plural of *medium*. The plural expression *the media* (meaning ‘radio, TV, newspapers, the internet …’) is now quite often used as an uncountable noun with a singular verb.

## Foreign plurals

Some words which come from foreign languages have special plurals. Examples:

| Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- |
| *analysis* | *analys**es*** (Latin) |
| *appendix* | *appendi**ces*** (Latin) |
| *bacterium* | *bacteri**a*** (Latin) |
| *basis* | *bas**es*** (Greek) |
| *cactus* | *cact**i*** (Latin) ``OR`` *cactuses* (less common) |
| *corpus* | *corp**ora*** (Latin) |
| *crisis* | *cris**es*** (Greek) |
| *criterion* | *criteri**a*** (Greek) |
| *diagnosis* | *diagnos**es*** (Greek) |
| *formula* | *formul**ae*** (Latin) ``OR`` *formulas* |
| *fungus* | *fung**i*** (Latin) ``OR`` *funguses* |
| *hypothesis* | *hypothes**es*** (Greek) |
| *kibbutz* | *kibbutz**im*** (Hebrew) |
| *nucleus* | *nucle**i*** (Latin) |
| *oasis* | *oas**es*** (Greek) |
| *phenomenon* | *phenomen**a*** (Greek) |
| *radius* | *radi**i*** (Latin) |
| *stimulus* | *stimul**i*** (Latin) |
| *vertebra* | *vertebr**ae*** (Latin) |

Note that some foreign plurals (e.g. *agenda*, *spaghetti*) are singular in English [(see here)](./countable-and-uncountable-nouns-basic-information#fruit-rice-wheat-spaghetti-hair-vegetables-peas-grapes).

## Plurals in *’s*

An apostrophe (’) can be used before the *\-s* in the plurals of letters of the alphabet, and sometimes in the plurals of dates and abbreviations.

- *She wrote ‘necessary’ with two **c’s**.*
- *I loved **the 1990’s**.* (*the 1990s* is more common)
- ***PC’s** are getting cheaper.* (*PCs* is more common)

It is not correct to use *\-’s* in other plurals, e.g. *~~jean’s~~*.

## Compound nouns

In noun + adverb combinations, the plural *\-s* is usually added to the noun.

| Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- |
| *passer-by* | ***passers**\-by* |
| *runner-up* | ***runners**\-up* |

The plural of *mother-in-law* and similar words is generally ***mothers**\-in-law*, etc, but some people use *mother-**in-laws***, etc. The plural of *court martial* (= military court or military trial) is either ***courts** martial* (more formal) or *court **martials** (less formal).*

In noun + noun combinations, the first noun is usually singular in form even if the meaning is plural (e.g. ***shoe** shop*). There are some exceptions. [(see here)](./nouns-in-combination-milk-chocolate#exceptions-first-noun-plural--a-clothes-shop).

## Plurals with no singular forms

*Cattle* is a plural word used to talk collectively about bulls, cows and calves; it has no singular, and cannot be used for counting individual animals (one cannot say, for instance, *~~three cattle~~*).

- *At one time **many cattle** suffered from a disease called BSE.* (not *~~Much cattle suffered …~~*)

*Police*, *staff* and *crew* are generally used in the same way.

- ***The police are** looking for a fair-haired man in his twenties.* (not *~~The police is looking …~~*) or *~~A police …~~*
- ***The staff are** on strike.* But *A member of staff said …* (not *~~A staff …~~*)

However, numbers are sometimes used before these three words (e.g. *four staff*, *six crew*).

The expressions *the British*, *the Dutch*, *the English*, *the French*, *the Irish*, *the Spanish* and *the Welsh* [(see here)](./../adjectives/adjectives-without-nouns#adjectives-of-nationality-the-irish-the-dutch) are also plural, with no singular forms.

- *In 1581 **the Dutch** declared their independence from Spain.* (but *A Dutchman came into the shop.* not *~~A Dutch …~~*)

*Trousers*, *jeans*, *pyjamas* (AmE *pajamas*), *pants*, *tights*, *shorts*, *scales*, *scissors*, *glasses*, *spectacles* (meaning ‘glasses’), *goggles*, *binoculars*, *pliers*, and the names of many similar objects that consist of two parts are plural, and have no singular forms. (The equivalent words in some other languages are singular.)

- *Your **jeans are** too tight.* (not *~~Your jean is …~~*)
- *‘Where **are** my **glasses**?’ ‘**They’re** on your nose.’*

To talk about individual items, we can use *a pair of* [(see here)](./piece-and-group-words-a-blade-of-grass-a-bunch-of-flowers#pair).

- *Have you got **a pair of nail scissors**?*

Other common words which are normally plural and don’t have singular forms include:

*arms* (= guns, etc), *clothes* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/cloth-and-clothes), *congratulations*, *contents*, *customs* (at a frontier), *earnings*, *funds* (= money), *goods*, *groceries*, *leftovers*, *lodgings*, *manners* (= social behaviour), *the Middle Ages* (a period in history), *oats* (but *corn*, *wheat*, *barley* and *rye* are singular uncountable), *odds* (= chances), *odds-and-ends*, *outskirts*, *premises* (= building), *proceeds*, *refreshments*, *regards*, *remains*, *savings*, *supplies*, *surroundings*, *thanks*, *troops*, *valuables*, *wages*.

- ***Congratulations** on your new job.* (not *~~Congratulation …~~*)
- *She lives on **the outskirts** of Cambridge.* (not *~~… the outskirt …~~*)
