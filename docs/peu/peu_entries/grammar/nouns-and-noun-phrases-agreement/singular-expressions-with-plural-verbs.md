# Singular expressions with plural verbs

## Groups of people: *The team is/are …*

In British English, singular words like *family*, *team*, *government*, which refer to groups of people, can have either singular or plural verbs and pronouns.

- *The team **is**/**are** going to lose.*

Plural forms are common when the group is seen as a collection of people doing personal things like deciding, hoping or wanting. Singular forms are more common when the group is seen as an impersonal unit. Compare:

- *My **family have decided** to move to York. **They’re** going in April.*  
  *The average **family has** 3.6 members. **It is** smaller than 50 years ago.*
- *My **company are** wonderful. **They do** all they can for me.*  
  *My **company was** founded in the 18th century.*

We prefer *who* as a relative pronoun with plural forms, and *which* with singular forms. Compare:

- *The committee, **who are** hoping to announce important changes, …*
- *The committee, **which is** elected at the annual meeting, …*

When a group noun is used with a singular determiner (e.g. *a/an*, *each*, *every*, *this*, *that*), singular verbs and pronouns are normal. Compare:

- ***The team are** full of enthusiasm.*
- ***A team which is** full of enthusiasm **has** a better chance of winning.* (More natural than *A team who are full …*)

Sometimes singular and plural forms are mixed.

- *The group gave **its** first concert in June and **they are** now planning a tour.*

Examples of group nouns which can be used with both singular and plural verbs in British English:

- *bank*
- *the BBC*
- *choir*
- *class*
- *club*
- *committee*
- *company*
- *England* (the football team)
- *family*
- *firm*
- *government*
- *jury*
- *ministry*
- *orchestra*
- *party*
- *public*
- *school*
- *staff*
- *team*
- *union*

In American English singular verbs are normal with most of these nouns in all cases (though *family* can have a plural verb). Plural pronouns can be used.

- *The team **is** in Detroit this weekend. **They** expect to win.*

## *A number of people have …*

Many singular quantifying expressions [(see here)](./../determiners-quantifiers/quantifying-expressions-a-lot-lots-a-great-deal-the-majority-etc) can be used with plural nouns and pronouns; plural verbs are normally used in this case.

- ***A number of people have** tried to find the treasure, but **they** have all failed.* (More natural than *A number of people has tried …*)
- ***A group of us are** going to take a boat through the Dutch canals.*
- ***A couple of my friends plan** to open a travel agency.* (not *~~A couple of my friends plans …~~*)
- ***A lot of social problems are** caused by unemployment.* (not *~~A lot of social problems is caused …~~*)
- ***The majority of criminals are** non-violent.*
- *Some of these people are relations and **the rest are** old friends.*
- ***Half of his students don’t** understand a word he says.* (not *~~Half of his students doesn’t …~~*)
