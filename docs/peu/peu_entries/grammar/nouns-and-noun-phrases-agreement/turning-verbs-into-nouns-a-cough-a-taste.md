# Turning verbs into nouns: *a cough*, *a taste*

## Using nouns for actions

It is very common to refer to an action by using a noun instead of a verb. Nouns of this kind often have the same form as the related verbs. The structure is especially common in an informal style.

- *There was a loud **crash**.*
- *I need a **rest**.*
- *What about a **drink**?*
- *Did I hear a **cough**?*
- *Would you like a **taste**?*
- *Come on – one more **try**!*

## Common structures

Nouns of this kind are often introduced by ‘general-purpose’ verbs such as *have*, *take*, *give*, *make*, *go for*.

- *I’ll **have a think** and let you know what I decide.* (informal BrE)
- *Let’s **have a talk** about your plans.*
- *Let your sister **have a go** on the swing.* (BrE)
- *Just **take a look** at yourself.*
- *I like to **have**/**take a bath** before I go to bed.*
- *If it won’t start, let’s **give** it **a push**.*
- *I don’t know the answer, but I’m going to **make a guess**.*

*Go for …* is common with nouns for physical activity [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/go-come-for-a).

- *I try to **go for a run** every day.*
- *Let’s **go for a walk**.*

We can use *\-ing* forms in a similar way after *do* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/do-general-purpose-verb-do-and-make#do-ing).

- *She **does a bit of painting**, but she doesn’t like to show people.*

These structures are very common when we talk about casual, unplanned or unsystematic recreational activity.

- *Let’s **have a swim**.* (More natural than *Let’s swim.*)
