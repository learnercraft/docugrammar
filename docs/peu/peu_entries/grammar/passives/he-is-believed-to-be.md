# *He is believed to be …*

## *I was asked to send …*

Many verbs can be followed by **object + infinitive** [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/verb-object-infinitive-i-want-you-to-listen).

- ***He asked me to send** a stamped addressed envelope.*
- *We **chose Felicity to be** the Carnival Queen.*

In most cases, these structures can be made passive.

- ***I was asked to send** a stamped addressed envelope.*
- ***Felicity was chosen to be** the Carnival Queen.*
- ***We were told not to come** back.*
- ***They are allowed to visit** Harry once a week.*

## *He is believed to be dangerous.*

With verbs like *think*, *feel*, *believe*, *know*, etc, the object + infinitive structure is rather formal and often unusual.

- *They **believe him to be** dangerous.* (more usual: *They believe that he* …)

However, the passive structure (e.g. *He is believed to be* …) is common, and often occurs in news reports.

- ***He is believed to be** dangerous.*
- ***Moriarty is thought to be** in Switzerland.*
- ***She is known to have been** married before.*
- ***It is considered to be** the finest cathedral in Scotland.*

Note that with *say*, the infinitive structure is only possible in the passive.

- ***His company is said to be** in trouble.* (but not *~~They say his company to be in trouble.~~*)

## *hear*, *see*, *make* and *help*

These verbs can be followed, in active structures, by object + infinitive without *to* [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles/infinitives-without-to-i-saw-you-come-in). In passive structures *to*\-infinitives are used. Compare:

- *I saw him **come** out of the house.*  
  *He was seen **to come** out of the house.*
- *They made him **tell** them everything.*  
  *He was made **to tell** them everything.*
- *They helped him **(to) get** out of the country.*  
  *He was helped **to get** out of the country.*

## Preparatory *there*

With some verbs (e.g. *say*, *think*, *feel*, *report*, *presume*, *understand*), the passive structure is possible with *there* as a ‘**preparatory subject**’.

- ***There are thought to be** more than 3,000 different languages in the world.* (= It is thought that there are …)
- ***There was said to be** disagreement between Ministers.*

## Perfect, progressive and passive infinitives

A passive verb can be followed by a perfect, progressive or passive infinitive.

- *He is believed **to have crossed** the frontier last night.*
- *I was told **to be waiting** outside the station at six o’clock.*
- *The hostages are expected **to be released** today.*

## Exceptions: wanting and liking

Verbs that refer to wanting, liking and similar ideas cannot usually be used in passive structures with infinitives after them.

- *Everybody **wanted Doris to be** the manager.* (but not *~~Doris was wanted to be the manager.~~*)
- *We **like our staff to say** what they think.* (but not *~~Our staff are liked to say what they think.~~*)
