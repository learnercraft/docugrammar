# *He was considered a genius.*

After some verbs the direct object can be followed by an ‘**object complement**’ – a noun or adjective which describes or classifies the object.

- *Queen Victoria considered him **a genius**.*
- *They elected Mrs Sanderson **President**.*
- *We all regarded Kathy as **an expert**.*
- *Most people saw him as **a sort of clown**.*
- *The other children called her **stupid**.*
- *You’ve made the house **beautiful**.*

In passive clauses these are ‘**subject complements**’; they come after the verb.

- *He was considered **a genius** by Queen Victoria.*
- *Mrs Sanderson was elected **President**.*
- *Kathy was regarded as **an expert**.*
- *He was seen as **a sort of clown**.*
- *She was called **stupid** by the other children.*
- *The house has been made **beautiful**.*
