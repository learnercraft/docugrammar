# *It was thought that …*

## Clause objects: *Nobody thought that she was a spy.*

Some sentences have clauses as their objects. These cannot normally become the subjects of passive sentences.

- *Nobody thought **that she was a spy**.* (but not *~~That she was a spy was thought by nobody.~~*)
- *We felt **that he was the right man for the job**.* (but not *~~That he was … was felt.~~*)
- *The newspapers say **that his company is in trouble**.* (but not *~~That his company is in trouble is said …~~*)

However, passive structures are often possible with preparatory *it* [(see here)](./../information-structure/preparatory-it-subject).

- ***It was thought** that she was a spy.*
- ***It was felt** that he was the right man for the job.*
- ***It is said** that his company is in trouble.*

## Infinitive objects: *They decided to …*

A few verbs that are followed by infinitives (for example *decide*, *agree*) can also be used in passive structures beginning with *it*.

- *They **decided to meet** at twelve.* → ***It was decided** to meet at twelve.*
- *We **agreed to open** a new branch.* → ***It was agreed** to open a new branch.*

However, most verbs cannot be used in this way.

- not *~~It is started to make a profit.~~* or *~~It is not expected to rain today.~~*
