# Verbs with two objects in the passive

Many verbs, such as *give*, *send*, *show*, *lend*, *pay*, *promise*, *refuse*, *tell*, *offer*, can be followed by two objects, an ‘**indirect object**’ and a ‘**direct object**’. These usually refer to a person (indirect object) and a thing (direct object). Two structures are possible.

- A. verb + indirect object + direct object
  - *She gave her sister the car.*
  - *I had already shown the police officer Sam’s photo.*

- B. verb + direct object + preposition + indirect object
  - *She gave the car to her sister.*
  - *I had already shown Sam’s photo to the police officer.*

Both of these structures can be made passive.

- A. indirect object becomes subject of passive verb
  - ***Her sister** was given the car.*
  - ***The police officer** had already been shown Sam’s photo.*

- B. direct object becomes subject of passive verb
  - ***The car** was given to her sister.*
  - ***Sam’s photo** had already been shown to the police officer*

The choice between the two passive structures may depend on what has been said before, or on what needs to be put last in the sentence ([(see here)](./when-do-we-use-passive-structures#putting-the-news-at-the-end), [(see here)](./when-do-we-use-passive-structures#putting-heavier-expressions-at-the-end). Structure A (e.g. *Her sister was given the car*) is the more common of the two. More examples:

- ***I’ve** just **been sent** a whole lot of information.*
- ***You were lent** ten thousand pounds last year.*
- ***The visitors were shown** a collection of old manuscripts.*
- ***They are being paid** a lot of money for doing very little.*
- ***He was refused** a visa because he had been in prison.*
- ***We will** never **be told** the real truth.*
- *How much **have you been offered**?*

In structure B (e.g. *The car was given to her sister*), prepositions are sometimes dropped before indirect object pronouns.

- *This watch was given **(to)** me by my father.*

*Explain* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/explain) and *suggest* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/suggest) cannot be used in structure A.

- ***The problem was explained** to the children.* (but not *~~The children were explained the problem.~~*)
- ***A meeting place was suggested** to us.* (but not *~~We were suggested a meeting place.~~*)

Note that prepositional phrases like ‘to the police officer’ are not called ‘indirect objects’ in all grammars.
