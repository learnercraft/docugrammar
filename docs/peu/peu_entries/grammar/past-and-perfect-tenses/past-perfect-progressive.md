# Past perfect progressive

## Forms

:::tip[Grammar]

*had been* + *-ing*

:::

- *I had been working.*
- *Where had she been staying?*
- *They hadn’t been listening.*

:::note

For double letters in words like *sitting*, *stopping*, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-formation-and-spelling/doubling-final-consonants).

:::

## Use

We use the past perfect progressive to talk about actions or situations which had continued up to the past moment that we are thinking about, or shortly before it.

- *At that time we **had been living** in the caravan for about six months.*
- *When I found Emily, I could see that she **had been crying**.*
- *I went to the doctor because I **had been sleeping** badly.*

## *how long?* past perfect progressive, not past progressive

We use a past perfect progressive, not a past progressive, to say how long something had been happening up to a past moment.

- *We’**d been walking** since sunrise, and we were hungry.* (not *~~We were walking since sunrise …~~*)
- *When she arrived, she **had been travelling** for twenty hours.* (not *~~… she was travelling …~~*)

:::note

For the difference between *since* and *for*, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/for-since-in-and-from-time).

## Progressive and simple: differences

Progressive forms are mostly used to talk about more temporary actions and situations. When we talk about longer-lasting or permanent situations we prefer simple forms. Compare:

- *My legs were stiff because I **had been standing** still for a long time.*
- *The tree that blew down **had stood** there for 300 years.*

Progressive forms generally emphasise the continuation of an activity; we use simple tenses to emphasise the idea of completion. Compare:

- *I **had been reading** science fiction, and my mind was full of strange images.*
- *I **had read** all my magazines, and was beginning to get bored.*

Some verbs are not normally used in progressive forms [(see here)](../verbs/non-progressive-verbs), even if the meaning is one for which a progressive form would be more suitable.

- *I **hadn’t known** her for very long when we got married.* (not *~~I hadn’t been knowing her …~~*)
