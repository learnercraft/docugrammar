# Present perfect: basic information

This entry deals with the simple present perfect. For the present perfect progressive, [(see here)](./present-perfect-progressive).

## Forms

:::tip[Grammar]

*have*/*has* + past participle

:::

- *I have broken my glasses.*
- *Have you finished?*
- *She hasn’t phoned.*

In older English, some present perfect forms were made with *be*, not *have* (e.g. *Winter **is** come*). This does not normally happen in modern English (for exceptions, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/finished), [(see here)](./../passives/my-suitcase-is-packed).

For details of question structures, [(see here)](./../basic-clause-types/questions-basic-rules).

For negatives, [(see here)](./../basic-clause-types/negative-structures-basic-rules).

For passive forms (e.g. *The work has been done*), [(see here)](./../passives/passive-structures-and-verb-forms).

## Other languages

In some other languages there are verb forms which are constructed like the English present perfect (compare English *I have worked*, French *j’ai travaillé*, German *ich habe gearbeitet*, Italian *ho lavorato*, Spanish *he trabajado*). Note that the English present perfect is used rather differently from most of these.## finished events connected with the present

We use the present perfect especially to say that a finished action or event is connected with the present in some way. If we say that something has happened, we are thinking about the past and the present at the same time, for example if we are giving news.

- *I **can’t go** skiing because I **have broken** my leg.*

A present-perfect sentence often corresponds to a present-tense sentence expressing the same facts.

- *I’**ve broken** my leg.* → *My leg **is broken** now.*
- *Some fool **has let** the cat in.* → *The cat **is** in.*
- *Utopia **has invaded** Fantasia.* → *Utopia **is** at war with Fantasia.*
- *Emily **has had** a baby.* → *Emily now **has** a baby.*
- *Our dog **has died**.* → *Our dog **is dead**.*
- ***Have** you **read** the Bible?* → ***Do** you **know** the Bible?*
- *All the wars in history **have taught** us nothing.* → *We **know** nothing.*

The present perfect is often used to express the idea of completion or achievement.

- *At last! I’**ve finished**!*
- ***Have** you **done** all the housework?*

We do not use the present perfect if we are not thinking about the present [(see here)](./present-perfect-or-past#not-thinking-about-the-present). Compare:

- *I’**ve travelled** in Africa a lot.* (= I know Africa.)
- *Some people think that Shakespeare **travelled** a lot in Germany.* (not *~~Some people think that Shakespeare has travelled …~~*)

## Time words: *ever*, *before*, *recently*, etc

When we talk about finished events with words that mean ‘at some/any time up to now’ (like *ever*, *before*, *never*, *yet*, *recently*, *lately*, *already*), we normally use the present perfect in British English. (For a note on American usage, [(see here)](./present-perfect-or-past-advanced-points#american-english).)

- ***Have** you **ever seen** a ghost?*
- *I’m sure we’**ve met before**.*
- *She’**s never said** ‘sorry’ in her life.*
- ***Has** Dan **phoned yet**?*
- *We **haven’t seen** Beth **recently**.*
- *‘Could you clean the car?’ ‘I’**ve already done** it.’*

## Repetition up to now: *I’ve written six emails …*

We can use the present perfect to say that something has happened several times up to the present.

- *I’**ve written** six emails since lunchtime.*

Adverbs of frequency like *often*, *sometimes*, *occasionally* are common with the present perfect.

- *How **often have** you **been** in love in your life?*
- *I’**ve sometimes thought** of moving to Australia.*

## Continuation up to now: *I’ve known her for years*

To talk about actions and situations that have continued up to the present, both the simple present perfect and the present perfect progressive are possible (depending on the kind of verb and the exact meaning. For details, [(see here)](./present-perfect-simple-or-progressive).

- *I’**ve known** her for years.* (not *~~I know her for years.~~* [(see here)](./present-perfect-or-present#how-long-present-perfect))
- *I’**ve been thinking** about you all day.*

:::note

For present perfect tenses in clauses referring to the future (e.g. *I’ll take a rest when I’**ve finished** cleaning the kitchen*), [(see here)](./../conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/tense-simplification-in-subordinate-clauses#present-perfect--when-ive-finished).
