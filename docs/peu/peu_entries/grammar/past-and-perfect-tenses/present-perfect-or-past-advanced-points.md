# Present perfect or past: advanced points

## Causes and origins: *Who gave you that?*

We normally use the present perfect when we are thinking about past events together with their present results [(see here)](./present-perfect-basic-information#time-words-ever-before-recently-etc).

- *I **can’t come** to your party because I’**ve broken** my leg.*

However, we usually prefer a past tense when we identify the person, thing or circumstances responsible for a present situation (because we are thinking about the past cause, not the present result). Compare:

- *Look what Jack’**s given** me!* (thinking about the gift)  
  *Who **gave** you that?* (thinking about the past action of giving)
- *Somebody **has spilt** coffee on the carpet.*  
  *Who **spilt** all that coffee on the carpet?*
  
Other examples:

- *‘Why are you crying?’ ‘Granny **hit** me.’* (not *~~… Granny has hit me.~~*)
- *I’m glad you **were** born.*
- *How **did** you **get** that bruise?*
- *That’s a nice picture. **Did** you **paint** it yourself?*
- *Some people think that ‘Pericles’ **was** not **written** by Shakespeare.*
- *The Chinese **invented** paper.* (not *~~The Chinese have invented paper.~~*)

## Expectation and reality: *You’re older than I thought.*

We use a past tense to refer to a belief that has just been shown to be true or false.

- *It’s not as big as I **expected**.* (not *~~… as I have expected.~~*)
- *You’re older than I **thought**.* (not *~~… than I have thought.~~*)
- *But you **promised** … !* (not *~~But you have promised …~~*)
- *I **knew** you would help me!* (not *~~I have known …~~*)

## *today*, *this week*, etc

With definite expressions of ‘time up to now’ (e.g. *today*, *this week*), perfect and past tenses are often both possible. We prefer the present perfect if we are thinking of the whole period up to now. We prefer the simple past if we are thinking of a finished part of that period. Compare:

- *I **haven’t seen** Jack this week.* (the whole week up to now – present perfect more natural)  
  *I **saw** Jack this week, and he said …* (earlier in the week – simple past more natural)
- ***Has** Anna **phoned** today?* (meaning ‘any time up to now’)  
  ***Did** Anna **phone** today?* (meaning ‘earlier, when the call was expected’)

## *always*, *ever* and *never*

In an informal style, a simple past tense is sometimes possible with *always*, *ever* and *never* when they refer to ‘time up to now’.

- *I **always knew** I could trust you.* (or *I’ve always known* …)
- ***Did** you **ever see** anything like that before?* (or *Have you ever seen* …?)

## Present perfect with past time expressions

Grammars usually say that the present perfect cannot be used together with expressions of finished time – we can say *I have seen him* or *I saw him yesterday*, but not *~~I have seen him yesterday~~*. In fact, such structures are unusual but not impossible (though learners should avoid them). They often occur in brief news items, where space is limited and there is pressure to announce the news and give the details in the same clause.

Here are some real examples taken from news broadcasts, newspaper articles, advertisements, letters and conversations.

- *Police **have arrested** more than 900 suspected drugs traffickers in raids throughout the country **on Friday and Saturday**.*
- *A 24-year-old soldier **has been killed** in a road accident **last night**.*
- *The horse’s trainer **has had** a winner here **yesterday**.*
- *… indicating that the geological activity **has taken place a very long time ago**.*
- *Perhaps what **has helped** us to win eight major awards **last year** alone …*
- *I **have stocked** the infirmary cupboard **only yesterday**.*
- *I am pleased to confirm that Lloyds Bank … **has opened** a Home Loan account for you **on 19th May**.*

## Simple past for news

Recently, some British newspapers and online news channels have started regularly using the simple past for smaller news announcements – probably to save space. Some authentic examples:

- *An unnamed businessman **was shot** dead by terrorists …*
- *A woman **was jailed** for six months after taking a baby boy from his mother.*
- *Driving wind and rain **forced** 600 out of 2,500 teenagers to abandon the annual ‘Ten Tor’ trek across Dartmoor.*

## American English

In American English the simple past is often used to give news.

- ***Did** you **hear**? Switzerland **declared*** / ***has declared** war on Mongolia!* (BrE *Have you heard? Switzerland has declared war …*)
- *Uh, honey, I **lost*** / *I’**ve lost** the keys* (BrE *… I’ve lost the keys.*)
- *Lucy just **called*** / ***has just called**.* (BrE Lucy has just called.)

In American English, it is also possible to use the simple past with indefinite past-time adverbs like *already*, *yet*, *ever* and *before*.

- ****Did** you **eat already**?* or **Have** you **eaten** …?* (BrE *Have you eaten already?*)
- **I **didn’t call** Bobby **yet*** or I **haven’t called** …* (BrE *I haven’t called …*)

British English is changing under American influence, so some of these uses are becoming common in Britain as well.

## Bad rules (1): ‘definite time’

Grammars sometimes say that the simple past, not the present perfect, is used with expressions referring to ‘definite time’. This is confusing – the present perfect is not often used with **finished** time expressions, but it actually is very common with **definite** time expressions. Compare:

- *I’**ve lived** here for **exactly three years, seven months and two days**.* (present perfect with very definite time-reference)
- ***Once upon a time** a little girl **lived** with her mother in a lonely house in a dark forest.* (simple past with very indefinite time-reference)

## Bad rules (2): ‘finished actions’

Note also that the choice between simple present perfect and simple past does not depend on whether we are talking about finished **actions**, as learners’ grammars sometimes suggest (though it can depend on whether we are talking about finished **time periods**). Compare:

- *That cat **has eaten** your supper.* (finished action – present perfect)
- *I **ate** the last of the eggs this morning.* (finished action – simple past)

## Bad rules (3): ‘recent actions’

The choice also does not depend directly on whether actions and events are recent. Recent events are more likely to be ‘news’, and we are more likely to be concerned about their present results, so many present perfect sentences are in fact about recent events. But it is possible to use the present perfect to talk about things that happened a long time ago. Compare:

- *The French revolution **has influenced** every popular radical movement in Europe since 1800.* (200-year-old event – present perfect)
- *Anna **phoned** five minutes ago.* (very recent event – simple past)

## Both possible

The difference between the present perfect and the simple past is not always very clear-cut. It often depends on our ‘focus’: are we thinking mostly about the present relevance of a past event, or about the past details? In some cases both present perfect and past are possible with little difference of meaning.

- *We **(have) heard** that you have rooms to let.*
- ***Has** Mark **phoned**?* or ***Did** Mark **phone**?*
- *I’**ve given** / I **gave** your old radio to Philip.*
