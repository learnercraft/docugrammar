## Spelling of regular affirmative past tense forms

| Rules | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Most regular verbs: add *-ed* | *work → work**ed***<br />*stay → stay**ed***<br />*show → show**ed***<br />*wonder → wonder**ed***<br />*visit → visit**ed***<br />*gallop → gallop**ed*** |
| Verbs ending in *-e*: add *-d* | *hope → hope**d***<br />*decide → decide**d*** |
| Verbs ending in one stressed vowel + one consonant (except *w* or *y*): double the consonant and add *-ed* | *shop → shop**ped***<br />*plan → plan**ned***<br />*reˈfer → refer**red***<br />*reˈgret → regret**ted***  |
| For last syllable not stressed: add *-ed* | *ˈoffer → offer**ed***<br />*ˈvisit → visit**ed*** |
| Verbs ending in consonant + *-y*: change *y* to *i* and add *-ed* | *hurry → hurr**ied***<br />*cry → cr**ied***<br />*study → stud**ied*** |
| For vowel + *-y*: add *-ed* | *play → play**ed*** |

Verbs ending in *-c* have *ck* in the past (e.g. *picnic → picni**ck**ed*).

In British English, *-l* is doubled in the past after one short vowel even if the vowel is not stressed: *ˈtravel → trave**ll**ed*.

## Use

We use the simple past for many kinds of past events: short, quickly finished actions and happenings, longer situations, and repeated events.

- *Daniel **broke** a window last night.*
- *I **spent** all my childhood in Scotland.*
- *Regularly every summer, Jessica **fell** in love.*

The simple past is common in stories and descriptions of past events.

- *One day the Princess **decided** that she **didn’t like** staying at home all day, so she **told** her father that she **wanted** to get a job …*

The simple past is often used with words referring to finished times.

- *I **saw** Jack **yesterday morning**. He **told** me …*

In general, the simple past tense is the normal one for talking about the past; we use it if we do not have a special reason for using one of the other tenses.
