# -ing forms and infinitives

Prepositions are not normally used before infinitives in English. After verb/noun/adjective + preposition, we usually use the *\-ing* form of a following verb.

- *He insisted **on being** paid at once.* (not *~~He insisted on to be paid …~~*)
- *I don’t like the idea **of getting** married.* (not *~~… the idea of to get married.~~*)
- *I’m not very good **at cooking**.* (not *~~… good at to cook.~~*)

In some cases we drop the preposition and use an infinitive. Compare:

- *He **asked for** a loan.*  
  *He **asked to borrow** some money.*
- *She was **surprised at** his mistake.*  
  *She was **surprised to see** what he had done.*
- *We’re travelling **for pleasure**.*  
  *We’re travelling **to enjoy** ourselves.*

Sometimes two structures are possible. There may be a difference of meaning [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/infinitives-or-ing-forms-both-possible-with-different-uses) for some examples).

- *I’m **interested in learning** more about my family.*
- *I was **interested to learn** that my grandfather was Jewish.*

For details of the structures that are possible after a particular verb, noun or adjective, see a good dictionary.
