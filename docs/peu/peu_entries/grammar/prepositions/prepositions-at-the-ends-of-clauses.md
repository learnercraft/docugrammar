# Prepositions at the ends of clauses

## Introduction

A preposition often connects two things: (1) a noun, adjective or verb that comes before it, and (2) a prepositional object – a noun phrase or pronoun that comes after the preposition.

- *This is a present **for** you.*
- *I’m really angry **with** Joe.*
- *He’s looking **at** her.*
- *They live **in** a small village.*

In some structures we may put the prepositional object at or near the beginning of a clause. In this case, the preposition does not always go with it – it may stay together with ‘its’ noun, adjective or verb at the end of the clause. This happens especially in four cases:

- **wh*\-questions: Who’s the **present for**?*
- *relative structures: Joe’s the person that I’m **angry with**.*
- *passives: She likes to be **looked at**.*
- *infinitive structures: The village is pleasant to **live in**.*

## *wh*-questions: *What are you looking at?*

When a question word is the object of a preposition, the preposition most often comes at the end of the clause, especially in informal usage.

- ***Who**’s the present **for**?* (*For whom is the present?* is extremely formal.)
- ***What** are you looking **at**?*
- ***Who** did you go **with**?*
- ***Where** did she buy it **from**?*
- ***Which** flight is the general travelling **on**?*
- ***What** kind of films are you interested **in**?*

This also happens in indirect *wh*\-questions, and in other *what*\-clauses.

- *Tell me **what** you’re worried **about**.*
- ***What** a lot of trouble I’m **in**!*

Some questions consist simply of question word + preposition.

- ***What with?***
- ***Who for?***

However, this structure is unusual when there is a noun with the question word.

- *With **what money**?* (not *~~What money with?~~*)

## Relative clauses: *the house I told you about*

When a relative pronoun [(see here)](./../relative-clauses/relatives-basic-information) is the object of a preposition, the preposition also often goes at the end of the clause, especially in informal usage.

- *Joe’s the person **that** I’m angry **with**.* (Less formal than … *with whom I am angry.*)
- *This is the house **(that)** I told you **about**.* (Less formal than *… about which I told you.*)
- *You remember the boy **(who)** I was going out **with**?*
- *She’s the only woman **(who)** I’ve ever really been in love **with**.*
- *That’s **what** I’m afraid **of**.*

Because *whom* is unusual in an informal style, it is very rare in clauses that end with prepositions [(see here)](./../relative-clauses/relatives-advanced-points#who-and-whom).

## Passives: *She likes to be looked at.*

In passive structures (see [*Passive*](../passives/passives-introduction)), prepositions go with their verbs.

- *She likes **to be looked at**.*
- *I don’t know where he is – his bed **hasn’t been slept in**.*
- *Kate **was operated on** last night.*

## Infinitive structures: *pleasant to live in*

Infinitive complements ( [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/infinitives-after-adjectives-pleased-to-see-you) can have prepositions with them.

- *The village is pleasant **to live in**.*
- *She needs other children **to play with**.*
- *Can you get me a chair **to stand on**?*
- *I’ve got lots of music **to listen to**.*
- *Their house isn’t easy **to get to**.*

## Exceptions: *During which period …?*

*During* and *since* are not normally put at the ends of clauses.

- ***During** which period did it happen?* (not *~~Which period did it happen during?~~*)
- ***Since** when have you been working for her?* (not *~~When have you been working for her since?~~*)

## Formal structures: *With whom …?*

In a more formal style, a preposition is often put earlier in questions and relative structures, before the question word or relative pronoun.

- ***With whom** did she go?*
- *It was the house **about which** he had told them.*
- *She was the only person **with whom** he could discuss his problems.*

This can also happen in infinitive complements, in a very formal style. A relative pronoun is used.

- *She needs other children **with whom to play**.*
- *It is a boring place **in which to live**.*

Note that after prepositions *which* and *whom* can be used, but not normally *who* and *that*.

Even in a very formal style, prepositions are not often put at the beginning of questions which have *be* as the main verb.

- *Who **is** it **for**, madam?* (not *~~For whom is it?~~*)

And the structures *where … to*, *what … like* and *what … for* have a fixed order.

- ***Where** shall I send it **to**?* (but not *~~To where shall I send it?~~*)
- ***What** does she look **like**?* (but not *~~Like what does she look?~~*)
- ***What** did you buy that **for**?* (but not *~~For what did you buy that?~~*)

Prepositions cannot be moved away from passive verbs even in a formal style.

- *In my family, money was never **spoken about**.* (not *~~… about money was never spoken.~~*)
