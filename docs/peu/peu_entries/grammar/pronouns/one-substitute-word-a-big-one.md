# one (substitute word): a big one

## Use

We often use *one* instead of repeating a singular countable noun.

- *‘Which is your boy?’ ‘The **one** in the blue coat.’*
- *I’d like a cake. A big **one** with lots of cream.*
- *‘Can you lend me a pen?’ ‘Sorry, I haven’t got **one**.’*

## *a … one*

We drop *a* if there is no adjective. Compare:

- *We’re looking for a house. We’d like a small **one** with a garden.*
- *We’d like **one** with a garden.* (not *~~… a one with a garden.~~*)

## *ones*

*One* has a plural *ones*.

- *‘I’d like to try on those shoes.’ ‘Which **ones**?’ ‘The **ones** in the window.’*
- *Green apples often taste better than red **ones**.*
- *‘What sort of sweets do you like?’ ‘**Ones** with chocolate inside.’*

## Uncountable nouns

We do not use *one(s)* for uncountable nouns. Compare:

- *If you haven’t got a fresh **chicken** I’ll take a frozen **one**.*
- *If you haven’t got fresh **juice**, I’ll take canned (juice).* (not *~~… canned one.~~*)

## *which (one)*, *this (one)*, etc

We can leave out *one(s)* immediately after *which*, *this*, *that*, *another*, *either*, *neither* and superlatives.

- *‘**Which (one)** would you like?’ ‘**This (one)** looks the nicest.’*
- *Let’s have **another (one)**.*
- ***Either (one)** will suit me.*
- *I think my dog’s the **fastest (one)**.*

But we cannot leave out *one(s)* if there is an adjective.

- ***This small one** looks the nicest.* (not *~~This small looks …~~*)

We nearly always leave out *ones* after *these* and *those*.

- *I don’t think much of **these**.* (More natural than … *these ones*.)

## Not used after *my*, etc, *some*, *several*, *a few*, *both* or a number

We do not use *one(s)* immediately after *my*, *your*, etc, *some*, *several*, *(a) few*, *both* or a number.

- *Take your coat and pass me **mine**.* (not *~~… pass me my one.~~*)
- *‘Are there any grapes?’ ‘Yes, I bought **some** today.’* (not *~~… I bought some ones today.~~*)
- *I’ll take **both**.* (not *~~… both ones.~~*)
- *She bought **six**.* (not *~~… six ones.~~*)

But *one(s)* is used if there is an adjective.

- *I’ll wear **my old one**.* (not *~~… my old.~~*)
- *I bought **some sweet ones** today.* (not *~~I bought some sweet today.~~*)
- *‘Has the cat had her kittens?’ ‘Yes, she’s had **four white ones**.’* (not *~~… four white.~~*)

## *that of*

*One(s)* is not normally used after a noun with possessive ’*s*. Instead, we can either just drop *one(s)*, or use a structure with *that/those of* (more formal).

- *A grandparent’s job is easier than **a parent’s**.* (not *~~… than a parent’s one.~~*)
- *A grandparent’s job is easier than **that of a parent**.* (not *~~… than the one of a parent.~~*)
- *Trollope’s novels are more entertaining than **those of Dickens**.* (not *~~… than Dickens’ ones / the ones of Dickens.~~*)

## Noun modifiers

*One(s)* is not generally used after noun modifiers.

- *Do you need coffee cups or **tea cups**?* (not *~~… or tea ones?~~*)

## *One(s)* always refers back

We use *one(s)* to avoid repeating a noun which has been mentioned before. It cannot normally be used in other cases.

- *Let’s go and ask **the old man** for advice.* (not *~~… ask the old one …~~*)
