# somebody, someone, anybody, anyone, etc

These indefinite pronouns and adverbials replace more definite noun/adverbial phrases when it is not necessary, or not possible, to be more precise.

## *-body* and *-one*

There is no significant difference between *somebody* and *someone*, *anybody* and *anyone*, *everybody* and *everyone*, or *nobody* and *no one*. The *\-one* forms are more common in writing; the *\-body* forms are more frequent in speech in British English.

## *some-* and *any-*

The differences between *somebody* and *anybody*, *something* and *anything*, *somewhere* and *anywhere*, etc are the same as the differences between *some* and *any* [(see here)](./../determiners-quantifiers/some-and-any-the-main-differences) for details). Compare:

- *There’s **somebody** at the door.*  
  *Did **anybody** telephone?*
- *Can I get you **something** to drink?*  
  *If you need **something**/**anything**, just shout.*
- *Let’s go **somewhere** nice for dinner.*  
  *I don’t want to go **anywhere** too expensive.*

## Singular

When these words are subjects they are used with singular verbs.

- ***Everybody likes** her.* (not *~~Everybody like her.~~*)
- ***Is everything** ready?* (not *~~Are everything ready?~~*)

*Somebody* normally refers to only one person. Compare:

- *There’s **somebody** outside who wants to talk to you.*
- *There are **some people** outside who want to talk to you.*

## Use of *they*

*They*, *them* and *their* are often used with a singular meaning to refer back to *somebody*, etc [(see here)](./singular-they).

- *If **anybody** wants a ticket for the concert, **they** can get it from my office.*
- *‘There’s **somebody** at the door.’ ‘Tell **them** I’m busy.’*
- ***Someone** left **their** umbrella on the bus.*
- ***Nobody** phoned, did **they**?*

## Complementation: *somebody nice*, etc

*Somebody*, etc can be followed by adjectives or adverbial expressions.

- *I hope he marries **somebody nice**.*
- *She’s going to meet **someone in the Ministry**.*
- *I feel like eating **something hot**.*
- *Let’s go **somewhere quiet** this weekend.*

They can also be followed by *else* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/else).

- *Emily – are you in love with **somebody else**?*
- *I don’t like this place – let’s go **somewhere else**.*

Note also the informal use of *much* after *any-* and *no-*.

- *We didn’t do **anything much** yesterday.*
- *There’s **nothing much** on TV tonight.*

## *someplace*

In informal American English, *someplace*, *anyplace*, *everyplace* and *no place* are common.

- *Let’s go *someplace* quiet.*

## *anyone* and *any one*; *everyone* and *every one*

*Anyone* means the same as *anybody*; *any one* means ‘any single one (person or thing)’. Compare:

- *Does **anyone** know where Celia lives?*
- *You can borrow **any one** book at a time.*

There is a similar difference between *everyone* and *every one*. Compare:

- ***Everyone** had a good time at the party.*
- *There aren’t any cakes left – they’ve eaten **every one**.*

## Sometime

*Sometime* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/some-time-sometime-and-sometimes) is not exactly part of this group. There are no words *~~everytime~~* or *~~notime~~*, and *any time* is written as two words. We say *some other time*, not *~~sometime else~~*.

For the difference between *no one* and *none*, [(see here)](./../determiners-quantifiers/no-one-and-none).
