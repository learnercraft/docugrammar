# Politeness: softening expressions

## *quite*, *maybe*, *I think*, etc

We can express our opinions and intentions less directly (and therefore more politely) by using softening expressions like *quite*, *rather*, *kind of*, *a bit*, *maybe*, *seem*, *at all* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/at-all).

- *He’s **quite** difficult to understand, isn’t he?*
- *I find her **rather** bossy, don’t you?*
- *The food’s **a bit** expensive.*
- *This music’s **kind of** boring.*
- ***Maybe** I’ll go for a walk now.*
- *They don’t **seem** very friendly.*
- *Will you be seeing Denise **at all**?*

## *I think I’ll* …

We can say that we are thinking of doing things, instead of expressing our intentions directly.

- *I **think** I’ll go to bed in a few minutes.*
- *I’**m thinking** of going to London tomorrow.*
- *I’d quite like to start **thinking** about going home.*

## *We would like to* …

In a formal style, requests, invitations, suggestions, etc are often introduced by *would like* instead of being expressed directly.

- *We **would like** to invite you to give a talk to our members on June 14th.*
- *I’**d like** to suggest that we take a vote.*
- *I **would like** to congratulate you on your examination results.*
