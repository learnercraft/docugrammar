# Rhetorical questions: *Who cares?*

## Questions that do not expect an answer

Questions do not always ask for information. In many languages, a question with an obvious answer can be used simply as a way of drawing attention to something. Questions of this kind are called ‘rhetorical questions’.

- ***Do you know** what time it is?* (= You’re late.)
- ***Who’s** a lovely baby?* (= You’re a lovely baby.)
- *‘I can’t find my coat.’ ‘**What’s this**, then?’* (= Here it is, stupid.)

Very often, a rhetorical question draws attention to a negative situation – the answer is obviously *No*, or there is no answer to the question.

- ***What’s the use** of asking her?* (= It’s no use asking her.)
- ***How do you expect** me to find milk on a Sunday night? **Where am I going** to find a shop open?* (= You can’t reasonably expect … There aren’t any shops open.)
- ***Where’s** my money?* (= You haven’t paid me.)
- *‘I can run faster than you.’ ‘**Who cares?**’* (= Nobody cares.)
- ***Are we going** to let them do this to us?* (= We aren’t …)
- ***Have you lost** your tongue?* (= Why don’t you say anything?)
- ***What do you think** you’re doing?* (= You can’t justify what you’re doing.)
- ***Who do you think** you are?* (= You aren’t as important as your behaviour suggests.)
- ***Why don’t you** take a taxi?* (= There’s no reason not to.)

## *Why/How should …?*

*Why should …?* can be used aggressively to reject suggestions, requests and instructions.

- *‘Anna’s very unhappy.’ ‘**Why should** I care?’*
- *‘Could your wife help us in the office tomorrow?’ ‘**Why should** she? She doesn’t work for you.’*

*How should/would I know?* is an aggressive reply to a question.

- *‘What time does the film start?’ ‘**How should** I know?’*

## Negative *yes/no* questions

Negative *yes/no* questions [(see here)](./../basic-clause-types/negative-questions) often suggest that the speaker wants the answer *Yes*, or some other positive response.

- ***Haven’t I done** enough for you?* (= I have done enough for you.)
- ***Didn’t I tell** you it would rain?* (= I told you …)
- *‘Don’t touch that! ’ ‘**Why shouldn’t I?**’* (= I have a perfect right to.)
