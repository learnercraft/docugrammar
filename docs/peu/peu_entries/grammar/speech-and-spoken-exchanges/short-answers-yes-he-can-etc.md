# Short answers: *Yes, he can*, etc

Answers are often grammatically incomplete, because they do not need to repeat words that have just been said. A common ‘short answer’ pattern is subject + auxiliary verb, together with whatever other words are really necessary.

- *‘Can he swim?’ ‘Yes, **he can**.’* (More natural than *Yes, he can swim.*)
- *‘Has it stopped raining?’ ‘No, **it hasn’t**.’*
- *‘Are you enjoying yourself?’ ‘**I** certainly **am**.’*
- *‘Don’t forget to write.’ ‘**I won’t**.’*
- *‘You didn’t phone Debbie last night.’ ‘No, but **I did** this morning.’*

We use *do* if there is no other auxiliary.

- *‘She likes cakes.’ ‘**She** really **does**.’*
- *‘That surprised you.’ ‘**It** certainly **did**.’*

Non-auxiliary *be* and *have* can be used in short answers.

- *‘Is she happy?’ ‘I think **she is**.’*
- *‘Have they any money?’ ‘Yes, **they have**.’*

Short answers can be followed by tags ( [(see here)](./question-tags-basic-information).

- *‘Nice day.’ ‘Yes, it is, **isn’t it**?’*

Note that stressed, non-contracted affirmative forms are used in short answers.

- *Yes, **I am**.* (not *~~Yes, I’m.~~*)
