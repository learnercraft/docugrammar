# Simple present for future

## Timetables, etc: *The summer term starts …*

We can sometimes use the simple present to talk about the future. This is common when we are talking about events which are part of a timetable, a regular schedule or something similar.

- *The summer term **starts** on April 10th.*
- *What time **does** the bus **arrive** in Seattle?*
- *My plane **leaves** at three o’clock.*
- *The sun **rises** at 6.13 tomorrow.*

*Will* is also usually possible in these cases.

- *The summer term **will start** on April 10th.*

## Subordinate clauses: *when she gets a job*

The simple present is often used with a future meaning in subordinate clauses – for example after *what*, *where*, *when*, *until*, *if*, *than*. For details, [see here](../conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/tense-simplification-in-subordinate-clauses).

- *I’ll tell you **what** I **find out**.* (not *~~… what I’ll find out.~~*)
- *She’ll pay us back **when** she **gets** a job.* (not *~~… when she’ll get a job.~~*)
- *Alex will see us tomorrow **if** he **has** time.* (not *~~… if he will have time.~~*)

## Instructions: *Where do I pay*?

Occasionally the simple present is used with a future meaning when asking for and giving instructions.

- *Where **do** I **pay?***
- *Well, what **do** we **do** now?*
- *So when you get to London you **go** straight to Victoria Station, you **meet** up with the others, Ramona **gives** you your ticket, and you **catch** the 17.15 train to Dover. OK?*

## Other cases

In other cases, we do not usually use the simple present to talk about the future.

- *Lucy’**s coming** for a drink this evening.* (not *~~Lucy comes …~~*)
- *I promise I’**ll call** you this evening.* (not *~~I promise I call you this evening.~~*)
- *‘There’s the doorbell.’ ‘I’**ll go**.’* (not *~~… I go.~~*)
