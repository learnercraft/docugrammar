# *will*

## Forms

:::tip[Grammar]

*will* + infinitive without *to*

:::

- *It **will be** cold tomorrow.*
- *Where **will** you **spend** the night?*

Some British people use *I shall* and *we shall* instead of *I/we will*, with no difference of meaning in most situations. However, *shall* is now rare, and it is almost non-existent in American English. For situations where it is still used, [(see here)](./../modal-auxiliary-verbs/instructions-and-requests-will-would-can-could-might-shall#asking-for-instructions-and-decisions-shall).

Contractions: *I’ll*, *you’ll*, etc; *won’t* /wəʊnt/

## Use: giving information about the future; predicting

*Will* + infinitive is used to give (or ask for) information about the future.

- *It’**ll be** spring soon.*
- ***Will** all the family **be** at the wedding?*
- *Karen **will** **start** work some time next week.*
- *In another thirteen minutes the alarm **will go** off. This **will close** an electrical contact, causing the explosive to detonate.*

We often use *will* in predictions of future events – to talk about what we think, guess or calculate will happen.

- *Tomorrow **will be** warm, with some cloud in the afternoon.*
- *Who do you think **will win** on Saturday?*
- *You’**ll** never **finish** that book.*

## Conditional use: *You’ll fall if you’re not careful.*

*Will* is often used to express conditional ideas, when we say what *will happen if* something else happens.

- *He’**ll have** an accident **if** he goes on driving like that.*
- ***If** the weather’s fine, we’**ll have** the party in the garden.*
- *Look out – you’**ll fall**!* (If you’re not more careful.)
- *‘Come out for a drink.’ ‘No, I’**ll miss** the film on TV **if** I do.’*
- *Don’t leave me. I’**ll cry**!*

## Future events already decided: *will* not used

When future events are already decided, or when we can ‘see them coming’, we often prefer a present form (usually present progressive or *going to …*).

- *I’**m seeing** the headmaster on Monday.*
- *My sister’**s going to have** a baby.*

## Not used in subordinate clauses: *when I arrive*

In subordinate clauses, we usually use present tenses instead of *will* [(see here)](./../conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/tense-simplification-in-subordinate-clauses#present-instead-of-future-ill-write-when-i-have-time).

- *I’ll phone you when I **arrive**.* (not *~~… when I will arrive.~~*)

For exceptions, [(see here)](./../conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/tense-simplification-in-subordinate-clauses#future-in-subordinate-clauses--where-she-will-be), [(see here)](./../if/if-will).
