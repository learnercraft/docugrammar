# Active verb tenses

## Present, future and past; simple, progressive and perfect

English verbs can refer to present, future or past time.

- present: *I’**m watching** you.*
- future: *She **will see** you tomorrow.*
- past: *Who **said** that?*

For each kind of time, there are three possibilities with most verbs: **simple**; **progressive** or **continuous** (*be* + *-ing* — [see here](./progressive-structures)); and **perfect** (*have* + past participle — [see here](./perfect-structures)).

- simple present: *I **start***
- present progressive: *I **am starting***
- present perfect: *I **have started***

Some grammarians use the word ‘tense’ only for simple forms like *goes* or *went*; for forms like *is going* or *has gone* they prefer to talk about progressive or perfect ‘aspect’, and they say that English has ‘no future tense’. These are principally questions of terminology, not grammatical fact, and have no practical importance. In *Practical English Usage* the term ‘tense’ is used for all verb forms and structures that indicate time.

## Tenses and time

There is not a direct relationship between verb forms and time. For example, a past verb like *went* is not only used to talk about past events (e.g. *We **went** to Morocco last January*), but also about unreal or uncertain present or future events (e.g. *It would be better if we **went** home now*). And present verbs can be used to talk about the future (e.g. *I’**m seeing** Daniel tomorrow*). Also, progressive and perfect forms express ideas that are not simply concerned with time—for example continuation, completion, present importance.

## Table of active verb tenses

This is a list of all the active affirmative forms of an ordinary English verb, with their names, examples, and very brief descriptions of typical uses. For more information about the forms and their uses, see the entries for each tense in [*Present tenses*](../present-tenses/present-tenses-introduction), [*Talking about the future*](../talking-about-the-future/talking-about-the-future-introduction), [*Past and perfect tenses*](../past-and-perfect-tenses/past-and-perfect-tenses-introduction).
