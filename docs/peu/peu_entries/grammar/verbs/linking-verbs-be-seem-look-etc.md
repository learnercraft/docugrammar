# Linking verbs: *be*, *seem*, *look*, etc

## Common linking verbs

Some verbs are used to join an adjective or noun complement to a subject. These verbs can be called ‘**linking verbs**’, ‘**copulas**’ or ‘**copular verbs**’. Common examples: *be*, *seem*, *appear*, *look*, *sound*, *smell*, *taste*, *feel*, *become*, *get*.

- *The weather **is** horrible.*
- *I do **feel** a fool.*
- *That car **looks** fast.*
- *She **became** a racehorse trainer.*
- *The stew **smells** good.*
- *It’**s getting** late.*

## Adjectives after linking verbs

After linking verbs we use adjectives, not adverbs. Compare:

- *He **spoke intelligently**.* (*Intelligently* is an adverb. It tells you about how the person spoke.)  
  *He **seems intelligent**.* (*Intelligent* is an adjective. It tells you about the person himself—rather like saying *He is intelligent*. *Seem* is a linking verb.)

## Other uses

Some of these verbs are also used with other meanings as ordinary non-linking verbs. They are then used with adverbs, not adjectives. Compare:

- *The problem **appeared impossible**.* (not *... ~~impossibly~~.*)  
  *Isabel **suddenly appeared** in the doorway.* (not *... ~~sudden~~ ...*)

Other verbs used in two ways like this are *look* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/look), *taste* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/taste) and *feel* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/feel).

## Change: *become*, *get*, *grow*, etc

Some linking verbs are used to talk about change, or the absence of change. The most common are: *become*, *get*, *grow*, *go*, *turn*, *stay*, *remain*, *keep*.

- *It’**s becoming** colder.*
- *It’**s growing** late.*
- *How does she **stay** so young?*
- ***Keep*** *calm.*
- *I’**m getting** sleepy.*
- *The leaves **are going** brown.*
- *I hope you will always **remain** so happy.*
- *His hair **is turning** grey.*

## Other verbs followed by adjectives

Sometimes other verbs, too, can be followed by adjectives. This happens when we are really describing the subject of the sentence, and not the action of the verb. It is common in descriptions with *sit*, *stand*, *lie*, *fall*.

- *The valley **lay quiet** and **peaceful** in the sun.*
- *She **sat motionless**, waiting for their decision.*
- *He **fell unconscious** on the floor.* (not *... ~~unconsciously~~ ...*)

Adjectives can also be used in the structure **verb + object + adjective**, to describe the object of the verb.

- *New `SUPER GUB` washes clothes `SUPER WHITE`.* (not *... ~~`WHITELY`~~ ...*)
- *He pulled his belt **tight** and started off.* (not *... ~~tightly~~ ...*)
