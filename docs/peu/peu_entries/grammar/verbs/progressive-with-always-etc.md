# Progressive with *always*, etc

We can use *always*, *continually* and similar words with a progressive form to mean ‘very often’.

- *I’**m always losing** my keys.*
- *Granny’**s always giving** people little presents.*
- *I’**m continually running** into Oliver these days.*
- *That cat’**s forever getting** shut in the bathroom.*

This structure is used to talk about things which happen very often (perhaps more often than expected), and which are unexpected or unplanned. Compare:

- *When Alice comes to see me, I **always meet** her at the station.* (a regular, planned arrangement)  
  *I’**m always meeting** Mrs Bailiff in the supermarket.* (accidental, unplanned meetings)
- *When I was a child, we **always had** picnics on Saturdays in the summer.* (regular, planned)  
  *Her mother **was always arranging** little surprise picnics and outings.* (unexpected, not regular)

The structure is often used in critical remarks.

- *He’**s always scratching** himself in public.*
