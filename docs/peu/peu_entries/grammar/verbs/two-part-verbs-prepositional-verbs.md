# Two-part verbs: prepositional verbs

## verb + preposition: *listen to*; *look at*

Many English verbs are regularly followed by prepositions before objects.

- *You never **listen to** me.* (not *~~You never listen me~~.*)
- *Luke walked down the road without **looking at** anybody.*

Prepositions are not used when there is no object.

- ***Listen**!* (not *~~Listen to!~~*)

## Idiomatic meanings: *look after*, *get over*

The meaning of a prepositional verb can be very different from the meanings of the two parts taken separately.

- *Could you **look after** the kids while I’m out?* (*Look after* is not the same as *look + after*.)
- *He took ages to **get over** his illness.* (*Get over* is not the same as *get + over*.)

## Word order: What are you thinking about?

When an object comes at the beginning of a clause (e.g. in a question or relative clause), a prepositional verb usually stays together, so that a preposition can be separated from its object and go at the end of the clause. For details of this and other preposition-final structures, [(see here)](./../prepositions/prepositions-at-the-ends-of-clauses).

- ***What*** *are you thinking **about**?* (not *~~About what are you thinking?~~*)
- *I’ve found the book **which** I was looking **for***. (More natural in an informal style than *... the book for which I was looking*.)

## Verbs with prepositions and particles together

A few verbs can be used with both an adverb particle [(see here)](./two-part-verbs-phrasal-verbs) and a preposition (making them three-part verbs).

- *I **get along with** her quite well.*
- *Stop talking and **get on with** your work.*
- *It’s hard to **put up with** people who won’t stop talking.*
- *If you’re on the road on Saturday night, **look out for** drunk drivers.*
- *I’ll think about it and **get back to** you.*
- *She **went up to** the officer and explained her problem.*
- *I’m **looking forward to** the party.*
