# Verbs of movement: *she ran in*, etc

When we want to talk about a movement, its direction and its nature, there are several possibilities.

We can use three separate words for the three ideas:

- *She **came in running**.*

We can use a verb which includes the idea of direction, and describe the nature of the movement separately:

- *She **entered running**.*

Or we can use a verb which makes clear the nature of the movement, and describe the direction separately:

- *She **ran in**.*

In English, the third of these solutions is the most common.

- *I **walked back**.* (More natural than *I went back walking*.)
- *She **danced across** the garden.* (More natural than *She crossed the garden dancing.*)
- *I **jumped down** the stairs.* (More natural than *I came down the stairs jumping.*)
- *They **crawled out** of the cellar.*
- *The eagle **flew away**.*
