# Verbs with both active and passive meanings

## *She opened the door.* / *The door opened.*

Some verbs are used transitively and intransitively with different kinds of subject. The intransitive use has a meaning rather like a passive [(see here)](./../passives/passive-structures-and-verb-forms) or reflexive [(see here)](./../pronouns/reflexive-pronouns-myself-etc) verb. Compare:

- *She **opened** the door.*  
  *The door **opened**.*
- *The wind’s **moving** the curtain.*  
  *The curtain’s **moving**.*
- *Marriage has really **changed** her.*  
  *She’s **changed** a lot since she got married.*
- *We’re **selling** a lot of copies of your book.*  
  *Your book’s **selling** well.*
- *Something **woke** her.*  
  *Suddenly she **woke**.*
- *I can’t **start** the car.*  
  *The car won’t **start**.*

## *It scratches easily.*

The intransitive structure is used with many verbs referring to things we can do to materials: e.g. *bend*, *break*, *crack*, *melt*, *polish*, *scratch*, *stain*, *tear*, *unscrew*.

- *Be careful what you put on the table—it **scratches** easily.* (= You can easily scratch it.)
- *These glasses are so fragile: they **break** if you look at them.*
- *The carpet’s made of a special material that doesn’t **stain**.*
- *The handle won’t **unscrew**—can you help me?*
