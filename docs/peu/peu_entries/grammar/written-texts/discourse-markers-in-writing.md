# Discourse markers in writing

**Discourse markers** are words and expressions which help to structure spoken exchanges and written text (e.g. *first of all*, *on the other hand*, *in any case*, *to sum up*). English has a very large number of these. Some are used in all kinds of discourse, some mostly in formal writing, and others mainly in informal speech. Those that are most common in writing are discussed here; for discourse markers in speech, [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/discourse-markers-in-speech). Most discourse markers are adverbs or adverbial expressions; some are conjunctions. For differences in punctuation and other points, [(see here)](./linking-with-conjunctions-and-adverbials).

Discourse markers can communicate several things:

- **‘What am I talking about?’** Discourse markers can introduce or clarify a topic, and show divisions and changes of topic.
- **‘What am I doing?’** They can show the type of communication that is going on.
- **attitude** They can show a writer’s attitude to what he or she is saying, or to the reader’s expectations.

## What am I talking about?

Some discourse markers say what a writer is about to focus on, and may show a link with previous discussion. Others show subdivisions and changes of topic.

### counter-argument

:::tip[Phrases]

*nevertheless; nonetheless; however; even so; but; still; all the same*

:::

These expressions are often used in a three-stage argument structure:

1. We say something that points in a certain direction.
2. We agree (the concession) that there are facts that point in the other direction.
3. But we finish (the counter-argument) by going back to the original position.

Note the use of *certainly* and *of course* in the above Phrases. When they are used in this way, an experienced reader knows that they will be followed by *but*, *all the same* or a similar expression.

### showing writer’s attitude

:::

- *The government, **no doubt** for excellent reasons, has reduced unemployment benefit.* (*No doubt* is often ironic: the writer may not be at all sure that the reasons are good.)
