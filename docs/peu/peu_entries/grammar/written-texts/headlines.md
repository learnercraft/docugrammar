# Headlines

## Special language

Headlines are the short titles above news reports (e.g. *``DOG FINDS ROMAN TREASURE``*). English news headlines can be very difficult to understand. One reason for this is that headlines are often written in a special style, which is very different from ordinary English. In this style there are some special rules of grammar, and words are often used in unusual ways.

## Grammar

1. Headlines are not always complete sentences. Many headlines consist of noun phrases with no verb.

    - *``MORE WAGE CUTS``*
    - *``LUXURY HOTEL DEATH``*
    - *``EXETER MAN’S DOUBLE MARRIAGE BID``*

2. Headlines often contain strings of three, four or more nouns; nouns earlier in the string modify those that follow.

    - *``FURNITURE FACTORY PAY CUT PROTEST``*  

    Headlines like these can be difficult to understand. It sometimes helps to read them backwards. *``FURNITURE FACTORY PAY CUT PROTEST``* refers to a *``PROTEST``* about a *``CUT``* (reduction) in *``PAY``* at a *``FACTORY``* that makes *``FURNITURE``*.

3. Headlines often leave out articles and the verb *be*.

    - *``SHAKESPEARE PLAY IMMORAL SAYS HEADMASTER``*
    - *``SCHOOLBOY WALKS IN SPACE``*

4. In headlines, simple tenses are often used instead of progressive or perfect forms. The simple present is used for both present and past events.

    - *``STUDENTS FIGHT FOR COURSE CHANGES``* (= … are fighting …)
    - *``BLIND GIRL CLIMBS EVEREST``* (= … has climbed …)

    The present progressive is used to talk about changes. *Be* is usually dropped.

    - *``BRITAIN GETTING WARMER, SAY SCIENTISTS``*
    - *``TRADE FIGURES IMPROVING``*

5. Many headline words are used as both nouns and verbs, and nouns are often used to modify other nouns (paragraph b above). So it is not always easy to work out the structure of a sentence. Compare:

    - *``US CUTS AID TO THIRD WORLD``* (= The US reduces its help … *``CUTS``* is a verb, *``AID``* is a noun.)
    - *``AID CUTS PROTEST``* (= There has been a protest about the reduction in aid. *``AID``* and *``CUTS``* are both nouns.)
    - *``CUTS AID REBELS``* (= The reduction is helping the revolutionaries. *``CUTS``* is a noun, *``AID``* is a verb.)

6. Headlines often use infinitives to refer to the future.

    - *``PM TO VISIT AUSTRALIA``*
    - *``HOSPITALS TO TAKE FEWER PATIENTS``*

    *For* is also used to refer to future movements or plans.

    - *``TROOPS FOR GLASGOW?``* (= Are soldiers going to be sent to Glasgow?)

7. Auxiliary verbs are usually dropped from passive structures.

    - *``MURDER HUNT: MAN HELD``* (= … a man is being held by police.)
    - *``SIX KILLED IN EXPLOSION``* (= Six people have been killed …)

    Note that forms like *``HELD``*, *``ATTACKED``* are usually past participles with passive meanings, not past tenses (which are rare in headlines). Compare:

    - *``AID PROTEST: PRESIDENT ATTACKED``* (= … the President has been attacked.)  
    - *``AID PROTEST: PRESIDENT ATTACKS CRITICS``* (= … the President has attacked her critics.)
    - *``BOY FOUND SAFE``* (= The missing boy has been found safe; he is safe.)  
    - *``BOY FINDS SAFE``* (= A boy has found a safe.)

8. *As* and *in* are often used instead of longer connecting expressions.

    - *``HOSPITAL BOSS AXED AS PATIENTS DIE``* (= … because patients have died.)
    - *``FOOTBALL MANAGER IN CAR CRASH``*

9. A colon (:) is often used to separate the subject of a headline from what is said about it.

    - *``STRIKES: PM TO ACT``*
    - *``MOTORWAY CRASH: DEATH TOLL RISES``*

    Quotation marks (‘…’) are used to show that words were said by somebody else, and that the report does not necessarily claim that they are true.
    - *``CRASH DRIVER ‘HAD BEEN DRINKING’``*

    A question mark (?) is often used when something is not certain.
    - *``CRISIS OVER BY SEPTEMBER?``*

## Vocabulary

Short words save space, and so they are very common in headlines. Some of the short words in headlines are unusual in ordinary language (e.g. *curb*, meaning ‘restrict’ or ‘restriction’), and some are used in special senses which they do not often have in ordinary language (e.g. *bid*, meaning ‘attempt’). Other words are chosen not because they are short, but because they sound dramatic (e.g. *blaze*, which means ‘big fire’, and is used in headlines to refer to any fire). The following is a list of common headline vocabulary.
