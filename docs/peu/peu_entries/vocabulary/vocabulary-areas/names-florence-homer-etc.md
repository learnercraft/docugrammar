# Names: Florence, Homer, etc

## Cities

The names of cities are often different in different languages – for example the capital of Denmark, *København*, is called *Kopenhagen* in German, *Copenhague* in French, and *Copenhagen* in Italian and English. Some examples of English names for cities:

- *Antwerp, Athens, Beirut, Belgrade, Bombay* (now usually *Mumbai*), *Brussels, Bucharest, Calcutta* (now usually *Kolkata*), *Cologne, Damascus, Florence, Geneva, Genoa, The Hague, Hanover, Jerusalem, Leghorn* (now more usually *Livorno*), *Lisbon, Lyons* (now more usually *Lyon*), *Marseilles* (now more usually *Marseille*), *Milan, Moscow, Munich, Naples, Oporto, Padua, Peking* (now usually *Beijing*), *Prague, Rome, St Petersburg, Seville, Thessalonica, Turin, Venice, Vienna, Warsaw*

## Classical names

The same is true of many classical Greek and Roman names. Some examples:

- *Homer, Aeschylus, Livy, Horace, Ovid, Virgil, Aesop, Aristotle, Euclid, Sophocles, Mercury, Jupiter, Helen, Troy, Odysseus*

## Artists

The Italian artists Raffaello Sanzio and Tiziano are called *Raphael* and *Titian* in English.

## Countries

The names of countries, of course, also differ from one language to another (for example *Deutschland* is called *Germany* in English; its neighbours call it, for instance, *Allemagne*, *Tyskland* or *Niemcy*). English versions are not listed here, as they are well known and can easily be found in any dictionary if needed.
