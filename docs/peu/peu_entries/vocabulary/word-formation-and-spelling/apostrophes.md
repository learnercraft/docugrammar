# Apostrophes

We use **apostrophes** (’) for three main reasons.

## Missing letters

Apostrophes replace letters in contracted forms [(see here)](./contractions-i-ll-don-t-etc).

- *can’t* (= cannot)
- *it’s* (= it is/has)
- *I’d* (= I would/had)
- *who’s* (= who is/has)

## Possessives

We use apostrophes before or after possessive *\-s* [(see here)](./../../grammar/nouns-and-noun-phrases-agreement/possessives-noun-s-forms).

- *the **girl’s** father*
- ***Charles’s** wife*
- *my **parents’** house*

Possessive determiners and pronouns (e.g. *yours*, *its*) do not have apostrophes.

- *This money is **yours**.* (not *~~… your’s.~~*)
- *The cat had not had **its** food yet.* (not *~~… it’s food …~~*)
- ***Whose** house did she stay in?* (not *~~Who’s …~~*)

## Special plurals

Words which do not usually have plurals sometimes have an apostrophe when a plural form is written.

- *It is a nice idea, but there are a lot of **if’s**.*

Apostrophes are generally used in the plurals of letters, and sometimes of numbers and abbreviations.

- *He writes **b’s** instead of **d’s**.*
- *It was in the early **1980’s**.* (More usually: *… 1980s.*)
- *I know two **MP’s** personally.* (More usually: *… MPs.*)

It is not correct to put apostrophes in normal plurals.

- *``JEANS – HALF PRICE``* (not *~~``JEAN’S …``~~*)
