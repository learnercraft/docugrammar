# Final e

## Final *-e* dropped before vowels

When an ending that begins with a vowel (e.g. *\-ing*, *\-able*, *\-ous*) is added to a word that ends in *\-e*, we usually drop the *\-e*.

- *hope → hoping*
- *make → making*
- *note → notable*
- *fame → famous*
- *shade → shady*

An exception in British English is *ageing* (more common than *aging*).

Some words that end in *\-e* have two possible forms before *\-able* and *\-age*. The form without *\-e* is more common in most cases. Note:

- *likeable* (usually with *e*)
- *mov(e)able* (both forms common)
- *mileage* (only with *e*)

Final *\-e* is not dropped from words ending in *\-ee*, *\-oe* or *\-ye*.

- *see → seeing*
- *agree → agreeable*
- *canoe → canoeist*
- *dye → dyeing*

## Final *-e* not dropped before consonants

Before endings that begin with a consonant, final *\-e* is not normally dropped.

- *excite → excitement*
- *definite → definitely*
- *complete → completeness*

Exceptions: words ending in *\-ue*

- *due → duly*
- *true → truly*
- *argue → argument*

In words that end with *\-ce* or *\-ge*, we do not drop *\-e* before *a* or *o*.

- *replace → replaceable*
- *courage → courageous*
- (but *charge → charging*, *face → facing*)

*Judg(e)ment* and *acknowledg(e)ment* can be spelt with or without the *\-e* after *g*.

:::note

For words ending in *\-ie*, [(see here)](./y-and-i#changing-ie-to-y). For adverbs ending in *\-ly*, [(see here)](./ly).
