# allow, permit and let

## *allow* and *permit*

These words have similar meanings and uses. *Permit* is more formal. Both words can be followed by object + infinitive.

- *We do not **allow/permit people to smoke** in the kitchen.*

When there is no personal object, an *\-ing* form is used.

- *We do not **allow/permit smoking** in the kitchen.*

Passive structures are common; personal subjects and gerund (*\-ing* form) subjects are both possible.

- ***People are not allowed/permitted** to smoke in the kitchen.*
- ***Smoking is not allowed/permitted** in the kitchen.*

The passive structure with *it* is only possible with *permit*.

- ***It is not permitted** to smoke in the kitchen.* (but not *~~It is not allowed to smoke …~~*)

*Allow*, but not *permit*, can be used with adverb particles.

- *She wouldn’t **allow** me **in**.*
- *Emily isn’t **allowed out** at night.*

## *let*

*Let* is the least formal of these three words, and is followed by object + infinitive without *to*. Compare:

- *Please **allow me to buy** you a drink.* (polite and formal)
- ***Let me buy** you a drink.* (friendly and informal)

*Let* is not usually used in the passive.

- *I **wasn’t allowed** to pay for the drinks.* (not *~~I wasn’t let …~~*)

*Let* can be used with adverb particles; passives are possible in this case.

- *She wouldn’t let me **in**.*
- *I’ve been **let down**.*
