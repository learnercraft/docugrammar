# almost and nearly; practically

## Progress, measurement and counting

*Almost* and *nearly* can both express ideas connected with progress, measurement or counting. *Nearly* is less common in American English.

- *I’ve **almost**/**nearly** finished.*
- *There were **almost**/**nearly** a thousand people there.*

Sometimes *almost* is a little ‘nearer’ than *nearly*. Compare:

- *It’s **nearly** ten o’clock.* (= perhaps 9.45)
- *It’s **almost** ten o’clock.* (= perhaps 9.57)

*Very* and *pretty* can be used with *nearly* but not *almost*.

- *I’ve **very**/**pretty nearly** finished.* (not *~~… very almost …~~*)

## Other meanings

We can use *almost* to mean ‘similar to, but not exactly the same’, and to make statements less definite. *Nearly* is not used like this.

- *Our cat understands everything – he’s **almost** human.* (not *~~… he’s nearly human.~~*)
- *My aunt’s got a strange accent. She **almost** sounds foreign.* (not *~~… She nearly sounds foreign.~~*)
- *I **almost** wish I’d stayed at home.* (not *~~I nearly wish …~~*)
- *Jake is **almost** like a father to me.*

## *never*, *nobody*, *nothing*, etc

We do not usually use *nearly* before negative pronouns or adverbs like *never*, *nobody*, *nothing*. Instead, we use *almost*, or we use *hardly* with *ever*, *anybody*, *anything*, etc.

- *She’s **almost never** / **hardly ever** at home.* (not *~~… nearly never …~~*)
- ***Almost nobody** / **hardly anybody** was there.*

## *everybody*, *everything*, *anybody*, *anything*, etc

We also prefer *almost* before *everybody*/*\-one*/*\-thing*/*\-where*, and *almost* is much more common than *nearly* before *anybody*/*\-one*/*\-thing*/*\-where*.

- *She likes **almost everybody**.*
- *He’s been **almost everywhere**.*
- ***Almost anybody** can do this job.*
- *He eats **almost anything**.*

## *practically*

*Practically* can be used in the same way as *almost*.

- *I’ve **practically** finished.*
- *Jake is **practically** like a father to me.*
- *She’s **practically** never at home.*
