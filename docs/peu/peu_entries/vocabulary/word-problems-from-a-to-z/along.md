# along

The preposition *along* is used before nouns like *road*, *river*, *corridor*, *line*: words that refer to things with a long thin shape.

- *I saw her running **along the road**.*
- *His office is **along the corridor**.*

To talk about periods or activities, we prefer *through*.

- ***through the centuries*** (not *~~**along** the centuries~~*)
- *all **through the journey*** (not *~~all **along** the journey~~*)
- *right **through the meal***

Note the special use of *along* as an adverb particle in expressions like *Come along (= Come with me)* or *walking along (= walking on oneâ€™s way).*
