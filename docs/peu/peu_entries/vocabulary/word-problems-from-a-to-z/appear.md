# appear

## Linking verb: ‘seem’

*Appear* can be a linking verb [(see here)](./../../grammar/verbs/linking-verbs-be-seem-look-etc), used to say how things look or seem. It is used in similar ways to *seem* [(see here)](./seem) for details), but is less frequent, especially in an informal style.

With this meaning, *appear* is followed by adjectives, not adverbs. We can use *appear* or *appear to be*.

- *He **appears (to be)** very **angry** today.* (not *~~He appears very angrily today.~~*)

Before nouns we generally use *appear to be*.

- *It **appears to be** some kind of bomb.*
- *The boys on the bus **appeared to be** students.*

Structures with preparatory *there* [(see here)](./../../grammar/be-have-and-do/there-is) or *it* [(see here)](./../../grammar/information-structure/preparatory-it-subject) are possible.

- ***There** appears to be a problem with the oil pressure.*
- ***It** appears that we may be mistaken.*

## *appear* and *seem*: differences

*Seem* can be used to talk both about objective facts and about subjective impressions and feelings [(see here)](./seem) for examples). *Appear* is mostly used to talk about objective facts. Compare:

- *The baby **seems/appears** (to be) hungry.*
- *She doesn’t want to go on studying. It **seems** a pity.* (not *~~It appears a pity.~~*)

*Seem* is often used with *like*. This is not normal with *appear*.

- *It **seemed like** a good idea.* (More natural than *It appeared like a good idea*.)

*Seem* can be used in a special structure with *can’t* [(see here)](./seem#other-infinitives). This is not possible with *appear*.

- *I **can’t seem** to make him understand.* (but not *~~I can’t appear to make him understand.~~*)

## ‘come into sight’

*Appear* can also mean ‘come into sight’ or ‘arrive’. In this case it can be modified by an adverbial.

- *She **suddenly appeared** in the doorway.*

For structures with *look*, [(see here)](./look).
