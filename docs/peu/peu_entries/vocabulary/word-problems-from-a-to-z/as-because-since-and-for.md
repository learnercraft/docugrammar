# as, because, since and for

All four of these words can be used to refer to the reason for something. (For *as*, *since* and *for* referring to time, [(see here)](./../../grammar/other-adverbial-clauses/as-when-and-while-simultaneous-events), [(see here)](./for-since-in-and-from-time), [(see here)](./since-tenses).) There are some differences.

## *as* and *since*

*As* and *since* are used when the reason is already known to the listener/reader, or when it is not the most important part of the sentence. *As*\- and *since*\-clauses often come at the beginning of sentences.

- ***As it’s raining again**, we’ll have to stay at home.*
- ***Since he had not paid his bill**, his electricity was cut off.*

*As*\- and *since*\-clauses are relatively formal; in an informal style, the same ideas are often expressed with *so*.

- *It’s raining again, **so** we’ll have to stay at home.*

## *because*

*Because* puts more emphasis on the reason, and most often introduces new information which is not known to the listener/reader.

- ***Because** I was ill for six months, I lost my job.*

When the reason is the most important part of the sentence, the *because*\-clause usually comes at the end. It can also stand alone. *Since* and *as* cannot be used like this.

- *Why am I leaving? I’m leaving **because** I’m fed up!* (not *~~… I’m leaving **as/since** I’m fed up!~~*)
- *‘Why are you laughing?’ ‘**Because** you look so funny.’*

A *because*\-clause can be used to say how one knows something.

- *You didn’t tell me the truth, **because** I found the money in your room.* (= … I know because I found …)

:::note

For more information about *because*, [(see here)](./because).

## *for*

*For* introduces new information, but suggests that the reason is given as an afterthought. A *for*\-clause could almost be in brackets. *For*\-clauses never come at the beginning of sentences, and cannot stand alone. *For*, used in this sense, is most common in a formal written style, and is becoming rare.

- *I decided to stop and have lunch – **for** I was feeling hungry.*

:::note

For *for* + object + infinitive clause (e.g. *What I want is **for everyone to have lunch***), [(see here)](./../../grammar/infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-other-uses/for-to).
