# as if and as though; like

## Meaning

*As if* and *as though* are both used to say what a situation seems like. They can refer to something that we think may be true.

- *It looks **as if**/**though** it’s going to rain.*
- *It sounds **as if**/**though** Jack’s going to change his job.*

They can also be used to talk about things which we know are not true.

- *I feel **as if/though** I’m dying.*
- *She was acting **as if/though** she was in charge.*

## Tenses

When we talk about things which we know are not true, we can use a past tense with a present meaning after *as if*/*though*. This emphasises the meaning of unreality. Compare:

- *She looks **as if** she **is** rich.* (Perhaps she is.)  
  *He talks **as if** he **was** rich.* (But he is definitely not.)
- *You look **as though** you **know** each other.*  
  *Why is he looking at me **as though** he **knew** me? I’ve never seen him before.*

In a formal style, *were* can be used instead of *was* in an ‘unreal’ comparison. This is common in American English.

- *He talks **as if** he **were** rich.*

## *like* meaning ‘as if/though’

*Like* is often used in the same way as *as if*/*though*, especially in an informal style. This used to be typically American English, but it is now common in British English.

- *It seems **like** it’s going to rain.*
- *He sat there smiling **like** it was his birthday.*
