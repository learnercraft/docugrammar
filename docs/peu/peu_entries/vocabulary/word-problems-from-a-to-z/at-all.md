# at all

## *at all* with a negative

We often use *at all* to emphasise a negative idea.

- *I didn’t understand anything **at all**.* (= I didn’t understand even a little.)
- *She was hardly frightened **at all**.*

## Questions, etc

*At all* can also be used in questions, and with ‘non-affirmative’ words like *if*, *ever* and *any*.

- *Do you play poker **at all**?* (= … even a little?)
- *He’ll come before supper if he comes **at all**.*
- *You can come whenever you like – any time **at all**.*

## *Not at all.*

The expression *Not at all* is used (especially in British English) as a rather formal answer to *Thank you* [(see here)](./../vocabulary-areas/social-language#thanks) and to *Do you mind if …?* [(see here)](./mind-do-you-mind-etc).
