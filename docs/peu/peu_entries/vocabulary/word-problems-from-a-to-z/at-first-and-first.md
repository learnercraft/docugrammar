# at first and first

We use *at first* to talk about the beginning of a situation, to make a contrast with something different that happens/happened later. *At first …* is often followed by *but*.

- ***At first** they were very happy, **but** then things started going wrong.*
- *The work was hard **at first, but** I got used to it.*

In other cases, we usually prefer *first*.

- *That’s mine – I saw it **first**!* (not *~~… I saw it at first.~~*)
- *We lived there when we were **first** married.* (= … in the early days of our marriage.) (not *~~… when we were at first married.~~*)
- ***First**, I want to talk about the history of the problem; then I’ll outline the situation today; and then we’ll discuss possible solutions.* (not *~~At first, I want to talk …~~*)

:::note

Note that *at last* is not the opposite of *at first*, [(see here)](./finally-at-last-in-the-end-and-at-the-end).

For *first(ly)* as a discourse marker, [(see here)](./../../grammar/speech-and-spoken-exchanges/discourse-markers-in-speech#what-are-we-talking-about).
