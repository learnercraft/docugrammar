# beat and win

You can *win* (in) a game, a race, a battle, an argument, etc, and you can *win* a prize, money, etc. You can *beat* a person that you are playing/arguing/fighting, etc against. Compare:

- *My girlfriend usually **wins** when we play poker.*
- *My girlfriend **beat** me at poker the first time we played.* (not *~~My girlfriend won me at poker …~~*)

Both verbs are irregular:

- *beat – beat – beaten*
- *win – won – won*
