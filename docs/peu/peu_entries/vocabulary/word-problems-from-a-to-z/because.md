# because

## *because* and *because of*

*Because* is a conjunction. It is used at the beginning of a clause, before a subject and verb. *Because of* is a two-word preposition, used before a noun or a pronoun. Compare:

- *We were late **because it rained**.* (not *~~… because of it rained.~~*)  
  *We were late **because of the rain**.* (not *~~… because the rain.~~*)
- *I’m happy **because I met you**.*  
  *I’m happy **because of you**.*

## Position of *because*-clauses

*Because* and its clause can go after or before the main clause.

- *I finished early **because I worked fast**.*
- ***Because I worked fast**, I finished early.*

*Because*\-clauses can sometimes stand alone, especially as answers or after hesitations.

- *‘Why are you crying?’ ‘**Because Jack and I have had an argument**.’*
- *I don’t think I’ll go to the party … **Because I’m feeling a bit tired**.*

## *just because … (it) doesn’t mean …*

This is quite a common structure in informal speech.

- ***Just because** you’re older than me **(it) doesn’t mean** you can do what you like.*
- ***Just because** I’m your brother **(it) doesn’t mean** you can keep asking me for money.*
