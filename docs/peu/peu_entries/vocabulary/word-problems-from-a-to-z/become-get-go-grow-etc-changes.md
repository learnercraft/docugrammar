# become, get, go, grow, etc: changes

*Become*, *get*, *go*, *come*, *grow* and *turn* can all be used with similar meanings to talk about changes. The differences between them are complicated – they depend partly on grammar, partly on meaning and partly on fixed usage.

## *become dark*, *become a pilot*, etc

*Become* can be used before adjectives and noun phrases.

- *It was **becoming very dark**.*
- *What do you have to do to **become a pilot**?*

*Become* is not usually used to talk about single deliberate actions.

- *Please **get ready** now.* (not *~~Please become ready now.~~*)

## *get dark*, *younger*, etc

*Get* (informal) is very common before adjectives (without nouns).

- *It was **getting very dark**.* (informal)
- *You **get younger** every day.* (informal)

*Get* can also be used before past participles like *lost*, *broken*, *dressed*, *married*.

- *They **got married** in 1986, and **got divorced** two years later.*

We generally use *go*, not *get*, to talk about changes of colour and some changes for the worse, like *go mad* (BrE) / *go crazy* [(see here)](./become-get-go-grow-etc-changes#go-red-go-mad-etc) below).

*Get* is not normally used before nouns to talk about changes.

- *I **became a grandfather** last week.* (not *~~I got a grandfather …~~*)

:::note

For *get used to*, [(see here)](./be-used-to).

## *get* + infinitive

We can sometimes use *get* with an infinitive to talk about a gradual change.

- *After a few weeks I **got to like** the job better.*
- *She’s nice when you **get to know** her.*

## *go red*, *go mad*, etc

*Go* can be used before adjectives to talk about change, especially in an informal style. This is common in two cases.

## Colours

*Go* (and not *get*) is used to talk about changes of colour, especially in British English.

- *Leaves **go brown** in autumn.* (not *~~Leaves get brown …~~*)
- *She **went white** with anger.*
- *Suddenly everything **went black** and I lost consciousness.*

Other examples: *go blue with cold / red with embarrassment / green with envy.*

*Turn* can also be used in these cases (see below), and so can *grow* when the change is gradual. *Go* is more informal than *turn* and *grow*.

## Changes for the worse

*Go* (not usually *get*) is used before adjectives in some expressions that refer to changes for the worse. People ****go mad**** (BrE), ***crazy***, ***deaf***, ***blind***, ***grey*** or ***bald***; horses ***go lame***; machines ***go wrong***; meat, fish or vegetables ***go bad***; milk ***goes sour***; bread ***goes stale***; beer, lemonade, musical instruments and car tyres ***go flat***.

- *He **went bald** in his twenties.*
- *The car keeps **going wrong**.*

Note that we use *get*, not *go*, with *old*, *tired* and *ill*.

## *come true*, etc

*Come* is used in a few fixed expressions to talk about things finishing up all right. The most common are *come right* (BrE) and *come true*.

- *I’ll make all your dreams **come true**.*
- *Trust me – it will all **come right** in the end.*

*Come* + infinitive can be used to talk about changes in mental state or attitude.

- *I slowly **came to realise** that she knew what she was doing.*
- *You will **come to regret** your decision.*

## *grow old*, etc

*Grow* is used before adjectives especially to talk about slow and gradual changes. It is more formal than *get* or *go*, and a little old-fashioned or literary.

- *Without noticing it he **grew old**.*
- *When they **grew rich** they began to drop their old friends.*
- *As the weather **grows colder**, I think of moving to a warmer country.*

*Grow* + infinitive can be used (like *come* + infinitive) to talk about changes in attitude, especially if these are gradual.

- *He **grew to accept** his stepmother, but he never **grew to love** her.*

## *turn red*, etc

*Turn* is used mostly for visible or striking changes of state. It is common before colour words (and is not so informal as *go*).

- *She **turned bright red** and ran out of the room.*
- *He **turns violent** after he’s had a couple of drinks.*

We can use *turn* before numbers to talk about important changes of age.

- *I **turned fifty** last week. It’s all downhill from now on.*

*Turn into* is used before nouns.

- *He’s a lovely man, but when he gets jealous he **turns into a monster**.*
- *A girl has to kiss a lot of frogs before one of them **turns into a prince**.*

*Turn to* and *turn into* can both be used before the names of materials.

- *Everything that King Midas touched **turned (in)to gold**.*
- *They stood there as if they had been **turned (in)to stone**.*

To talk about a change of occupation, religion, politics, etc, we sometimes use *turn* with a noun (with no preposition or article) or an adjective.

- *He worked in a bank for thirty years before **turning painter**.*
- *Towards the end of the war he **turned traitor**.*
- *At the end of her life she **turned Catholic**.*

*Turn (in)to* can also be used to talk about changing one thing into another.

- *In the Greek legend, Circe **turned men into pigs**.*

## *fall ill*, etc

*Fall* is used to mean ‘become’ in *fall ill*, *fall asleep* and *fall in love*.

## Verbs related to adjectives: *thicken*, *brighten*, etc

A number of verbs which are related to adjectives have meanings like ‘get more …’ or ‘make more …’. Many of them end in *\-en*. Examples:

- *The fog **thickened**.*
- *The weather’s beginning to **brighten** up.*
- *They’re **widening** the road here.*
- *His eyes **narrowed**.*
- *Could you **shorten** the sleeves on this jacket?*

## No change: *stay*, *keep*, *remain*

To talk about things not changing, we can use *stay*, *keep* or *remain* before adjectives. *Remain* is more formal.

- *How do you manage to **stay young** and fit?*
- ***Keep calm**.*
- *I hope you will always **remain so charming**.*

*Stay* and *remain* are also sometimes used before noun phrases.

- *Promise me you will always **stay**/**remain my little boy**.*

*Keep* can be used before *\-ing* forms.

- ***Keep smiling** whatever happens.*
