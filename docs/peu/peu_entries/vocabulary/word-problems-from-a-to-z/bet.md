# bet

## Use

*I bet (you)* can be used in an informal style to mean ‘I think it’s probable that’. *That* is usually dropped.

- ***I bet (you)** she’s not at home.* (More natural than *I bet (you) that she’s not at home*.)

*I’ll bet* … is also possible.

- *I’**ll bet** you she’s not at home.*

## Tenses

After *I bet (you)*, we often use a present tense to refer to the future.

- *I bet (you) they **don’t come** this evening.* (or I bet (you) they won’t come …)
- *I bet (you) the Conservatives **(will) lose**.*

## Two objects

When *bet* is used to talk about real bets, it can be followed by two objects: the person with whom the bet is made, and the money or thing that is bet.

- *I bet **you £5** it doesn’t rain this week.*
- *My father bet **my mother dinner** at the Ritz that she would marry him. He won, but she never bought him the dinner.*

*Bet* is irregular (*bet* – *bet* – *bet*).
