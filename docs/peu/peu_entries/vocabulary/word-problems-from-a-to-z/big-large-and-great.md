# big, large and great

## Concrete nouns: usually *big* or *large*

With concrete nouns – the names of things you can see, touch, etc – we mostly use *big* and *large*. *Big* is most common in an informal style.

- *Get your **big** feet off my flowers.*
- *She is a small woman, but she has very **large** hands.*
- *It was a **large** house, situated near the river.*

## *great* with concrete nouns

*Great* is not normally used simply to talk about physical size. In an informal style, it is often used with concrete nouns to mean ‘wonderful’.

- *I’ve just got a **great** new bike.*

And it can also be used with meanings like ‘large and impressive’.

- ***Great** clouds of smoke rose above the burning cathedral.*

Another meaning is ‘famous’ or ‘important’.

- *Do you think Napoleon was really a **great** man?*

## Abstract nouns: usually *great*

*Great* is common with abstract nouns – the names of things you cannot see, touch, etc.

- *I have **great respect** for her ideas.* (not *~~big/large respect~~*)
- *His behaviour caused **great annoyance**.* (not *~~big/large annoyance~~*)
- *You are making a **great mistake**.*
- *Her work showed a **great improvement** last year.*

*Big* can be used with countable abstract nouns in an informal style.

- *You’re making **a big mistake**.*
- ***Big bargains** for weekend shoppers!*

*Large* is used with countable abstract nouns referring to quantities, amounts and proportions.

- *We’re thinking of giving your company a very **large order**.*
- *There was a **large error** in the accounts.*
- *She spent **large sums** on entertaining.*
- *He wrote a **large part** of the book while he was in prison.*

*Big* and *large* are not generally used with uncountable nouns – but note the fixed expressions *big business*, *big trouble*.

## *large* and *wide*

*Large* is a ‘false friend’ for speakers of some languages. It does not mean ‘wide’.

- *The river is 100 metres **wide**.* (not *~~… 100 metres large.~~*)

:::note

For *wide* and *broad*, [(see here)](./broad-and-wide).
