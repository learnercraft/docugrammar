# bring and take

## Speaker’s/hearer’s position

We mostly use *bring* for movements to the place where the speaker or hearer is, and *take* for movements to other places. Compare:

- *This is a nice restaurant. Thanks for **bringing** me here.* (not *~~… thanks for taking me here.~~*)  
  *Let’s have another drink, and then I’ll **take** you home.* (not *~~… and then I’ll bring you home.~~*)
- *(on the phone) Can we come over on Sunday? We’ll **bring** a picnic.*  
  *Let’s go and see Aunt May on Sunday. We can **take** a picnic.*

## Speaker’s/hearer’s past or future position

We can also use *bring* for a movement to a place where the speaker or hearer already was or will be. Compare:

- *‘Where’s that report?’ ‘I **brought** it to you when you were in Mr Allen’s office. Don’t you remember?’*  
  *I **took** the papers to Jack’s office.*
- *I’ll arrive at the hotel at six o’clock. Can you **bring** the car at six-thirty?*  
  *Can you **take** the car to the garage tomorrow? I won’t have time.* (not *~~Can you bring the car to the garage tomorrow? …~~*)

## Joining a movement

*Bring (with)* can be used to talk about joining a movement of the speaker’s/hearer’s, even if *take* is used for the movement itself.

- *I’m **taking** the kids to the circus tonight. Would you like to come with us and **bring** Susie?*

## Somebody else’s position

Sometimes when we are talking about somebody else (not the speaker or hearer), that person can become the centre of our attention. In that case, we use *bring* for movements to the place where he/she is (or was or will be). This often happens in stories.

- *He heard nothing for months. Then one day his brother **brought** him a letter.*

## American English

Americans often use *bring* where British English has *take*.

- *Let’s go and see Aunt May on Sunday. We can **bring** a picnic.*

:::note

The difference between *come* and *go* is similar. [(see here)](./come-and-go)

For other uses of *take*, [(see here)](./take-time).
