# dare

## Uncommon

In modern English, *dare* is not a very common verb. In an informal style, people generally use other expressions.

- *He’s not afraid to say what he thinks.* (More natural than *He dares to say what he thinks.*)

## Negative use; *daren’t*

*Dare* is, however, quite often used in negative sentences. It can be followed by an infinitive with or without *to*.

- *She **doesn’t dare (to) go** out at night.*
- *The old lady **didn’t dare (to) open** the door.*

A special negative form *daren’t* (+ infinitive without *to*) exists in British English.

- *I **daren’t look**.*

The third person singular is also *daren’t*, without *\-s*.

- *She **daren’t** tell him what she thinks.*

## Special expressions

*Don’t you dare!* is sometimes used to discourage people from doing unwanted things.

- *‘Mummy, can I draw a picture on the wall?’ ‘**Don’t you dare**!’*

*How dare you?* is sometimes used as an indignant exclamation.

- ***How dare you?** Take your hands off me at once!*

And *I dare say* (sometimes written *I daresay*) is a rather old-fashioned expression meaning ‘I think probably’, ‘I suppose’.

- ***I dare say** it’ll rain soon.*
- ***I daresay** you’re ready for a drink.*

Children use the expression *I dare you* + infinitive to challenge each other to do frightening things.

- ***I dare you to run** across the road with your eyes shut.*
