# dress

## Noun

The countable noun *dress* means an article of women’s clothing (it goes from the shoulders to below the hips).

- *This is the first time I’ve seen you wearing **a dress**.*

There is also an uncountable noun *dress* (not used with the article *a/an*). It means ‘clothing’, ‘clothes’. It is not very common in modern English, and is used mostly to talk about special kinds of clothing (for example *national dress*, *evening dress*, *battledress*).

- *He looks good in evening **dress**.* (not *~~… in an evening dress.~~*)

## Verb: putting clothes on

The verb *dress* can be used to talk about putting clothes on oneself or somebody else. *Undress* is used for taking clothes off.

- *It only takes me five minutes to **dress** in the morning.*
- *Could you **dress** the children for me?*
- *I’m going to **undress** in front of the fire.*

In informal English, we use *get dressed/undressed* to talk about dressing or undressing oneself.

- *Get **dressed** and come downstairs at once!*

*Put on* and *take off* are generally used when clothes are mentioned.

- *I **put on** a sweater, but it was so warm that I had to **take** it **off** again.*

## Verb: wearing clothes

To say what somebody is/was wearing on a particular occasion, we can use the form *be dressed in* (note the preposition).

- *I didn’t recognise him because he **was dressed in** a dark suit.* (not *~~… dressed with …~~*) or *~~… dressing in …~~*
- *She **was dressed in** orange pyjamas.*

*Be wearing* and *have on* (especially AmE) are also very common.

- *She **was wearing** orange pyjamas.*
- *She **had on** orange pajamas.* (AmE)

The active form *dress (in)* can be used to give the idea of repetition or habit.

- *He **dresses** well.*

Note also the expression *well dressed*.
