# enough

## Adjective/adverb + *enough*

*Enough* usually follows adjectives and adverbs.

- *Is it **warm enough** for you?* (not *~~… enough warm …~~*)
- *You’re not driving **fast enough**.*

## *enough* + noun

*Enough* can be used before a noun as a determiner [(see here)](./../../grammar/determiners-quantifiers/enough).

- *Have you got **enough milk**?*
- *There aren’t **enough glasses**.*

*Enough* is occasionally used after a noun, but this is rare in modern English except in a few expressions.

- *If only we had **time enough** …*
- *I was **fool enough** to believe him.*

Before another determiner (article, possessive, etc) or a pronoun, we use *enough of*. Compare:

- *I don’t know **enough** Spanish to read this.* (not *~~… enough of Spanish …~~*)
- *I don’t understand **enough of the** words in the notice.*

## Position with adjective + noun

When *enough* modifies an adjective and noun together, it comes before the adjective. Compare:

- *We haven’t got **enough big** nails.* (= We need more big nails – *enough* modifies *big nails*.)
- *We haven’t got **big enough** nails.* (= We need bigger nails – *enough* modifies *big*.)

## *enough* + infinitive; structure with *for*

We can use an infinitive structure after *enough*.

- *She’s old enough **to do** what she wants.*
- *I haven’t got enough money **to buy** a car.*

Infinitives can be introduced by *for* + noun/pronoun.

- *It’s late enough **for the staff to stop** work.*
- *There was just enough light **for us to see** what we were doing.*

## *It’s small enough to put in your pocket*, etc

The subject of the sentence can be the object of the following infinitive. (For more about this structure, [(see here)](./../../grammar/infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/infinitives-after-adjectives-pleased-to-see-you#easy-to-please).) Object pronouns are not normally used after the infinitive in this case.

- ***The radio’**s small enough **to put** in your pocket.* (not *~~… to put it in your pocket.~~*)
- ***Those tomatoes** aren’t ripe enough **to eat**.* (not *~~… to eat them.~~*)

However, object pronouns are possible in structures with *for*.

- *The radio was small enough **for** me to put (**it**) in my pocket.*
- *Those tomatoes aren’t ripe enough **for** the children to eat (**them**).*

## *the* = *enough*; leaving out *enough*

The article *the* can be used to mean ‘enough’.

- *I hardly had **the** strength to take my clothes off.*
- *I didn’t quite have **the** money to pay for a meal.*

*Time* and *room* are often used to mean ‘enough time’ and ‘enough room’.

- *Do you have **time** to look at this draft?*
- *There isn’t **room** for everybody to sit down.*
