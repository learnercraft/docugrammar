# far and a long way

## *far* in questions and negatives

*Far* is most common in questions and negative clauses.

- *How **far** did you walk?*
- *The youth hostel is not **far** from here.*

In affirmative clauses we usually prefer *a long way*.

- *We walked **a long way**.* (not *~~We walked far.~~*)
- *The station is **a long way** from here.* (More natural than *The station is far from here*.)

## *far* in affirmative clauses

However, *far* is normal in affirmative clauses with *too*, *enough*, *as* and *so*.

- *‘She’s gone **far enough**.’ ‘A bit **too far**.’*
- *It’s ready **as far** as I know.*
- *‘Any problems?’ ‘OK **so far**.’*

## *far* with comparatives, etc

*Far* is also used (in all kinds of clauses) to modify comparatives, superlatives and *too*.

- *She’s **far older** than her husband.*
- *This bike is **by far the best**.*
- *You’re **far too young** to get married.*

## Before a noun: *a far country*

*Far* can be used as an adjective before a noun, meaning ‘distant’. This is rather formal and old-fashioned.

- *Long ago, in a **far** country, there lived a woman who had seven sons.*

:::note

*Much*, *many* and *long* (for time) are also more common in questions and negative sentences ( [(see here)](./../../grammar/determiners-quantifiers/much-and-many), [(see here)](./long-and-for-a-long-time).
