# finally, at last, in the end and at the end

## *finally*

*Finally* can suggest that one has been waiting a long time for something. In this sense, it often goes in mid-position (with the verb, [(see here)](./../../grammar/adverbs-and-adverbials/mid-position-details).

- *After trying three times, she **finally** managed to pass her exam.*
- *Josh has **finally** found a job.*

*Finally* can also introduce the last element in a series, like *lastly* [(see here)](./../../grammar/written-texts/discourse-markers-in-writing#what-am-i-talking-about).

- *We must increase productivity. We must reduce unemployment. And **finally**, we must compete in world markets.*

## *at last*

*At last* also suggests – very strongly – the idea of impatience or inconvenience resulting from a long wait or delay.

- *James has paid me that money **at last**.*
- *When **at last** they found him he was almost dead.*

*At last* can be used as an exclamation. (*Finally* cannot be used in this way.)

- ***At last**! Where the hell have you been?*

Note that *lastly* (introducing the last item in a series) is not the same as *at last*.

- *Firstly, we need to increase profits. Secondly, … Thirdly, … And **lastly**, we need to cut down administrative expenses.* (not *~~… And at last we need to cut down …~~*)

## *in the end*

*In the end* suggests that something happens after changes or uncertainty.

- *We made eight different plans for the weekend, but **in the end** we went to Brighton.*
- *I left in the middle of the film. Did they get married **in the end**?*
- *The tax man will get you **in the end**.*

Another use of *in the end* is to mean ‘after we have considered everything’.

- ***In the end**, you can’t get fit without exercise.*
- ***In the end**, Mother knows best.*

## *at the end*

*At the end* simply refers to the position of something. There is no sense of waiting or delay.

- *A declarative sentence has a full stop **at the end**.*
- *I wish I was paid at the beginning of the week and not **at the end**.*

:::note

For *eventually*, [(see here)](./eventual-ly).
