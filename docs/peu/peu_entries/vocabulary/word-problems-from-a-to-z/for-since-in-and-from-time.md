# for, since, in and from: time

## *for*

We use *for* for duration – to say how long something lasts.

:::tip[Grammar]

*for* + period of time

:::

- *I studied the guitar **for three years** at school.*
- *That house has been empty **for six months**.*
- *We go away **for three weeks** every summer.*
- *My boss will be in Italy **for the next ten days**.*

To measure duration up to the present, we use a present perfect tense [(see here)](./../../grammar/past-and-perfect-tenses/present-perfect-or-present#how-long-present-perfect), not a present tense.

- *I’**ve known** her for a long time.* (not *~~I know her for a long time.~~*)
- *We’**ve lived** here for 20 years.* (not *~~We live here for 20 years.~~*)

A present tense with *for* refers to duration into the future. Compare:

- *How long **are** you here **for**?* (= Until when …?)
- *How long **have** you **been** here **for**?* (= Since when …?)

We can often leave out *for* in an informal style, especially with *How long …?* And *for* is not usually used before *all*.

- ***How long** have you been waiting **(for)**?*
- *We’ve been here **(for) six weeks**.*
- *I’ve had a headache **all day**.*

## *for* and *since* with perfect tenses: the difference

*For* and *since* can both be used with a present perfect to talk about duration up to the present. They are not the same. Compare:

:::tip[Grammar]

*for* + period

:::

- *I’ve known her **for three days**.* (not *~~… since three days.~~*)
- *It’s been raining **for weeks**.*

:::tip[Grammar]

*since* + starting point

:::

- *I’ve known her **since Tuesday**.*
- *It’s been raining **since the beginning of the month**.*

With a past perfect, *for* and *since* refer to duration up to a particular past moment.

- *She’d been working there **for a long time**.* (not *~~… since a long time.~~*)
- *She’d been working there **since 1988**.*

## *in* after negatives and superlatives

After negatives and superlatives, *in* can be used to talk about duration. This is normal in American English.

- *I **haven’t** seen him **for**/**in months**.*
- *It was the **worst** storm **for**/**in ten years**.*

## *from* and *since*

*From* and *since* give the starting points of actions, events or states: they say when things begin or began.

:::tip[Grammar]

*from*/*since* + starting point

:::

- *I’ll be here **from three o’clock** onwards.*
- *I work **from nine** to five.*
- ***From now** on, I’m going to go running every day.*
- ***From his earliest childhood** he loved music.*
- *I’ve been waiting **since six o’clock**.*
- *I’ve known her **since January**.*

We use *since* (with a perfect tense) especially when we measure duration from a starting point up to the present, or up to a past time that we are talking about.

- *I’**ve been working since** six o’clock, and I’m getting tired.* (not *~~I’ve been working from six o’clock …~~*)
- *I **had been working since** six o’clock, and I was getting tired.*

*From* is used in other cases.

- *The shop was open **from eight** in the morning, but the boss didn’t arrive till ten.* (not *~~The shop was open since eight …~~*)
- *I’ll be at home **from Tuesday morning (on)**.* (not *~~… since Tuesday morning.~~*)

*From* is sometimes possible with a present perfect, especially in expressions that mean ‘right from the start’.

- *She’s been like that **from her childhood**.* (or … **since** her childhood.)
- ***From**/**Since** the moment they were married, they’ve quarrelled.*
- ***From**/**Since** the dawn of civilisation, people have made war.*
