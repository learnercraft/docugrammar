# get and go: movement

*Go* is used to talk about a whole movement.

*Get* is used when we are thinking mainly about the end of a movement – the arrival. Compare:

- *I **go** to work by car and Lucy **goes** by train.*  
  *I usually **get** there first.*
- *I **went** to a meeting in Bristol yesterday.*  
  *I **got** to the meeting at about eight o’clock.*

We often use *get* to suggest that there is some difficulty in arriving.

- *It wasn’t easy to **get** through the crowd.*
- *I don’t know how we’re going to **get** over the river.*
- *Can you tell me how to **get** to the police station?*

For *get* and *go* meaning ‘become’, [(see here)](./become-get-go-grow-etc-changes).
