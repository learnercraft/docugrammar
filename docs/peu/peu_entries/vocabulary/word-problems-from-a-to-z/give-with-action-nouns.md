# give with action nouns

## *give a cough*, etc

We can replace certain verbs by a structure with *give* and a noun. This often happens in British English, for example, with verbs referring to sounds made by people (e.g. *cough*, *cry*, *scream*, *chuckle*, *laugh*, *shout*).

- *He **gave a cough** to attract my attention.*
- *Suddenly she **gave a loud scream** and fell to the ground.*

## *give somebody a smile*, etc

The structure is also used with an indirect object (in both British English and American English) to replace transitive verbs, especially in an informal style. Common expressions:

- *give somebody a smile, a look, a kiss, a hug, a call*
- *give something a push, a kick*
- *give it a try, a go, a shot*
- *give it a miss* (BrE)
- *not give it a thought*
- *She **gave me a strange look**.*
- *I’ll **give you a call** if I hear anything.*
- *If the car won’t start, we’ll **give it a push**.*
- *‘Perhaps salt will make it taste better.’ ‘OK, let’s **give it a try**.’*
- *‘Are you coming to the film?’ ‘No, I’m tired. I’**ll give it a miss’** .* (BrE)
- *He seemed to be in a bad temper, but I didn’t **give it a thought**.*
