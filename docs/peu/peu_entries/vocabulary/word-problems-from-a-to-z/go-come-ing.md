# go/come …ing

## *go …ing*

We use *go* with an *\-ing* form to talk about activities in which people move about, and which do not have a fixed beginning or end. The structure is common in expressions referring to sport and leisure activities – for example *go climbing*, *go dancing*, *go fishing*, *go hunting*, *go riding*, *go sailing*, *go shooting*, *go skating*, *go skiing*, *go swimming*, *go walking*.

- *Let’s **go climbing** next weekend.*
- *Did you **go dancing** last Saturday?*

*Go …ing* is also used to talk about looking for or collecting things.

- *I think I’ll **go shopping** tomorrow.*
- *In June all the students **go looking** for jobs.*
- *Anne’s **going fruit-picking** this weekend.*

We do not use *go …ing* to talk about activities that have a more definite beginning and end (not *~~go boxing, go watching a football match~~*).

## *come …ing*

*Come …ing* is also possible in certain situations (for the difference between *come* and *go*, [(see here)](./come-and-go).

- ***Come swimming** with us tomorrow.*

## Prepositions

Note that prepositions of place, not direction, are used after *go/come …ing*.

- *I went swimming **in** the river.* (not *~~I went swimming to the river.~~*)
- *She went shopping **at** Harrods.* (not *~~… to Harrods.~~*)
