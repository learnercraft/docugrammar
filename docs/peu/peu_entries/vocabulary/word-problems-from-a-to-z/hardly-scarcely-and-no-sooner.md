# hardly, scarcely and no sooner

These three expressions can be used (often with a past perfect tense, [(see here)](./../../grammar/past-and-perfect-tenses/past-perfect-basic-information) to suggest that one thing happened very soon after another. Note the sentence structure:

:::tip[Grammar]

… *hardly* … *when/before* …

:::

:::tip[Grammar]

… *scarcely* … *when/before* …

:::

:::tip[Grammar]

… *no sooner* … *than* …

:::

- *I had **hardly/scarcely** closed my eyes **when** the phone rang.*
- *She was **hardly/scarcely** inside the house **before** the kids started screaming.*
- *I had **no sooner** closed the door **than** somebody knocked.*
- *We **no sooner** sat down in the train **than** I felt sick.*

In a formal or literary style, inverted word order is possible [(see here)](./../../grammar/information-structure/inversion-auxiliary-verb-before-subject#after-negative-and-restrictive-expressions-at-no-time-was-he-).

- ***Hardly had I** closed my eyes when I began to imagine fantastic shapes.*
- ***No sooner had she** agreed to marry him than she started to have doubts.*
