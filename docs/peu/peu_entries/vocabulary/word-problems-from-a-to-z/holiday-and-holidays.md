# holiday and holidays

In British English, the plural *holidays* is often used for the ‘long holiday’ of the year. In other cases we normally use the singular *holiday*. Compare:

- *Where are you going for your summer **holiday(s)**?*
- *We get five days’ Christmas **holiday** this year.*
- *Next Monday is a public **holiday**.*

The singular is used in the British expression *on holiday* (note the preposition).

- *I met Marianne **on holiday** in Norway.* (not *~~… on/in holidays …~~*)

Americans more often use the word *vacation*. (In British English, *vacation* is mainly used for the periods when universities are not teaching.) **Holiday** is most often used in American English for a day of publicly observed celebration (such as Thanksgiving) when people do not have to work.
