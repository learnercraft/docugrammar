# in and into, on and onto: prepositions

## Position and direction

We generally use *in* and *on* to talk about the positions of things – where they **are**; and *into* and *onto* to talk about directions and destinations – where things are **going**. Compare:

- *A moment later the ball was **in** the goal.*  
  *The ball rolled slowly **into** the goal.* (not *~~… rolled slowly in the goal.~~*)
- *She was walking **in** the garden.*  
  *Then she walked **into** the house.*
- *The cat’s **on** the roof again.*  
  *How does it get **onto** the roof?*

Note that *into* and *onto* are normally written as single words. *On to* is also possible in British English.

## *in* and *on* for movement

After some verbs (e.g. *throw*, *jump*, *push*, *put*, *fall*) we can use both *in* and *into*, or *on* and *onto*, to talk about directional movement. We prefer *into*/*onto* when we think of the movement itself, and *in*/*on* when we think more of the end of the movement – the place where somebody or something will be. Compare:

- *The children keep jumping **into** the flowerbeds.*  
  *Go and jump **in** the river.*
- *In the experiment, we put glowing magnesium **into** jars of oxygen.*  
  *Could you put the ham **in** the fridge?*
- *He was trying to throw his hat **onto** the roof.*  
  *Throw another log **on** the fire.*

We use *in* and *on* after *sit down* and *arrive*.

- *He sat down **in** the armchair, and I sat down **on** the floor.* (not *~~He sat down into…~~*) or *~~I sat down onto …~~*
- *We arrive **in** Athens at midday.* (not usually *~~We arrive into Athens …~~*)

:::note

For *arrive at* …, [(see here)](./at-on-and-in-place).

## *into* for change

We normally use *into* after verbs suggesting change.

- *When she kissed the frog, it **changed into** a handsome prince.* (not *~~… changed in a handsome prince.~~*)
- *Can you **translate** this **into** Chinese?* (not *~~… translate this in Chinese?~~*)

*Cut* can be followed by *into* or *in*.

- ***Cut** the onion **in(to)** small pieces.*

And note the expression *in half*.

- *I broke it **in half**.* (not *~~… into half.~~*)

## *in* and *on* as adverbs

*In* and *on* are used as adverbs for both position and movement.

- *I stayed **in** last night.*
- *What have you got **on**?*
- *Come **in**!* (not *~~Come into!~~*)
- *Put your coat **on**.*
