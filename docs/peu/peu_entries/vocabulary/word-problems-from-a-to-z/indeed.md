# indeed

## *very … indeed*

*Indeed* can be used to emphasise *very* with an adjective or adverb. This is rather formal, and is unusual in American English.

- *I was **very pleased indeed** to hear from you.*
- *He was driving **very fast indeed**.*
- *Thank you **very much indeed**.*

*Indeed* is unusual in this sense without *very*, and is not normally used after *extremely* or *quite*.

- *not *~~He was driving fast indeed.~~**
- *not *~~He was driving quite/extremely fast indeed.~~**

## *indeed* with verb

*Indeed* can also be used after *be* or an auxiliary verb in order to suggest confirmation or emphatic agreement. This is rather formal. It is common in short answers [(see here)](./../../grammar/speech-and-spoken-exchanges/short-answers-yes-he-can-etc).

- *We are **indeed** interested in your offer, and would be glad to have prices.*
- *‘It’s cold.’ ‘It is **indeed**.’*
- *‘Henry made a fool of himself.’ ‘He did **indeed**.’*
