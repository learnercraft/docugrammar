# it’s time

## Followed by infinitive

*It’s time* (or *it is time*) can be followed by an infinitive.

- ***It’s time to buy** a new car.*

To say who should do something, we use *for* + object + infinitive [(see here)](./../../grammar/infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-other-uses/for-to).

- *It’s time **for her to go** to bed.*

## Followed by past tense with present or future reference

*It’s time* can also be followed by a subject with a past tense verb. The meaning is present.

- ***It’s time she was** in bed.*
- ***It’s time you washed** those trousers.*
- *I’m getting tired. **It’s time we went** home.*

The expression *It’s high time …* is often used in this structure, to say that something is urgent.

- ***It’s high time you got** a job.*

:::note

For other structures in which a past tense has a present or future meaning, [(see here)](./../../grammar/past-and-perfect-tenses/past-verb-form-with-present-or-future-meaning).
