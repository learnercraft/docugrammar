# its and it’s

These two words are often confused by native speakers of English as well as by foreign learners.

*Its* is a possessive word (like *my*, *your*).

- *Every country has **its** traditions.* (not *~~… it’s traditions.~~*)

*It’s* is the contracted form of *it is* or *it has*.

- ***It’s** raining again.* (not *~~Its raining again.~~*)
- *Have you seen my camera? **It’s** disappeared.* (not *~~… Its disappeared.~~*)

:::note

There is a similar difference between *whose* and *who’s*, [(see here)](./whose-and-who-s).
