# last, the last, the latest

## *last week*, *month*, etc; *the last week*, *month*, etc

*Last week*, *month*, etc (without *the*) is the week, month, etc just before this one. If I am speaking in July, *last month* was June; in 2016, *last year* was 2015.

*The last week*, *month*, etc is the period of seven/thirty, etc days up to the moment of speaking. On July 15th 2016, *the last month* is the period from June 16th to July 15th; *the last year* is the 12 months starting in July 2015.

Compare:

- *I was ill **last week**, but I’m OK this week.* (not *~~I was ill the last week …~~*)  
  *I’ve had a cold for **the last week**. I feel terrible.*
- *We bought this house **last year**.*  
  *We’ve lived here for **the last year**, and we’re very happy with the place.*

The difference between *next* and *the next* is similar. [(see here)](./next-and-the-next-nearest)

## *the last three …*, etc

Note the word order in expressions with numbers.

- *I’ve been busy for **the last three** months.* (not *~~… for the three last months.~~*)

We generally say *the last few days*/*weeks*, etc, not *the last days*/*weeks*, etc.

- ***The last few days** have been busy.* (not *~~The last days …~~*)

## The last in a series

*The last* can also mean ‘the last in a series’.

- *In **the last** week of the trip something funny happened.*
- *This is going to be **the last** Christmas I’ll spend at home.*

## *latest* and *last*

We can use *latest* to talk about something new, and *last* to mean ‘the one before’. Compare:

- *Her **latest** book’s being published next week.* (not *~~Her last book …~~*)  
  *She thinks it’s much better than her **last** one.*
- *He’s enjoying his **latest** job.* (not *~~He’s enjoying his last job.~~*)  
  *But it doesn’t pay as much as his **last** one.*
