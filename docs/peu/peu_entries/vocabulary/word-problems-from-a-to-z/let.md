# let

## Followed by infinitive without *to*

*Let* is followed by object + infinitive without *to*.

- *We usually **let the children stay** up late on Saturdays.* (not *~~… let the children to stay / staying …~~*)
- *She didn’t **let me see** what she was doing.* (not *~~… let me saw …~~*)

Note the expressions *let … know* (= tell, inform) and *let … have* (= send, give).

- *I’ll **let you know** my travel dates next week.*
- *Could you **let me have** the bill for the car repair?*

*Let go of* means ‘stop holding’.

- *Don’t **let go of** Mummy’s hand.*

## Not used in passives

This structure is unusual in passive forms; we prefer *allow*.

- *After questioning he **was allowed** to go home.*

## With object + preposition / adverb particle

*Let* can be followed by an object and a prepositional phrase or adverb particle expressing movement.

- *You’d better **let the dog out** of the car.*
- ***Let him in**, could you?*
- *Those kids **let my tyres down**.*

This structure is also common in the passive.

- *He **was let out** of prison early for good behaviour.*
