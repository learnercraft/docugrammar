# like: verb

## Not used in progressive forms

*Like* is not usually used in progressive forms [(see here)](./../../grammar/verbs/non-progressive-verbs).

- *‘What do you think of the soup?’ ‘I **like** it.’* (not *~~… I’m liking it.~~*)

## Not used without an object

*Like* cannot normally be used without an object.

- *‘How do you feel about ballet?’ ‘I **like it**.’* (not *~~… I like.~~*)

For exceptions, [(see here)](./like-verb#if-you-like-etc) below.

## *very much*: position

We can use *very much* with *like*, but not *very* alone.

- *I **very much** like his latest film.* (not *~~I very like his latest film.~~*)

*Very much* does not come between *like* and its object [(see here)](../../grammar/adverbs-and-adverbials/position-of-adverbials-introduction).

- *I **like** you and your sister very much. or I very much **like** you and your sister.* (not *~~I like very much you and your sister.~~*)

## *like …ing*: enjoyment

To talk about enjoying activities in general, we can use **like …ing** (especially common in British English) or *like* + infinitive.

- *I really **like walking / to walk** in the woods.*
- *Children always **like listening / to listen** to stories.*

To talk about enjoying something on one occasion, we use *like …ing*.

- *I really **liked working** with him on his boat last week.*

*Like* + object + verb is possible.

- *I don’t **like people phoning / to phone** me in the middle of the night.*

## *like* + infinitive: choices and habits

We can use *like* + infinitive to talk about choices and habits.

- *I **like to do** the shopping early on Saturday mornings.*
- *When I’m pouring tea I **like to put** the milk in first.*

*Not like to* can mean ‘think it better not to’.

- *‘Why didn’t you tell me before?’ ‘I **didn’t like to disturb** you at home.’*

*Like* + object + infinitive is possible.

- ***She likes the children to go** to bed early during the week.*

## *would like*

We use *would like* + infinitive as a polite way of saying ‘want’, especially in requests and offers.

- *I’**d like** two kilos of tomatoes, please.*
- *‘**Would** you **like** to dance?’ ‘Yes, OK.’* (not *~~Would you like **dancing**? …~~*)

*Do you like …?* is not used in this way.

- not *~~**Do** you **like** some more coffee?~~*

*Would like to* can be used instead of repeating a whole infinitive [(see here)](./../../grammar/information-structure/ellipsis-infinitives).

- *‘How about playing tennis? ’ ‘I’**d like to**.’*

Polite requests often begin *If you would like …* ; the following clause is sometimes dropped.

- ***If you would like** to take a seat, I’ll see if Mr Smithers is free.*
- ***If you would like** to come this way …*

*Would* is sometimes dropped in this structure.

- ***If you like** to come this way …*

:::note

For *would like* with a perfect infinitive (e.g. *I would like to have seen that*), [(see here)](./../../grammar/infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles/use-of-perfect-infinitives-glad-to-have-left).

:::

## *if you like*, etc

When we offer people a choice, we often use *like* to mean ‘want (to)’ in subordinate clauses. Note that *to* is not used.

- *‘Can I go now?’ ‘If you **like**.’* (not *~~If you like to.~~*)
- *Do it **any** way you **like**.*
- *Come **when** you **like**.*
- *You can sit **wherever** you **like**.*
