# means

## Singular and plural ending in *-s*

Both the singular and the plural of *means* end in *\-s*.

- *In the 19th century a new **means** of communication was developed – the railway.* (not *~~… a new mean of communication …~~*)
- *There are several **means** of transport on the island.*

:::

## *by all/any/no means*

*By all means* is not the same as *by all possible means*. It is used to give permission or to encourage somebody to do something, and means ‘of course’ or ‘it is all right to …’ Compare:

- *‘Can I borrow your sweater?’ ‘**By all means**.’*
- ***By all means** get a new coat, but don’t spend more than £150.*
- *We must help her **by all possible means**.* (not *~~We must help her by all means.~~*)

*By no means* (or *not by any means*) is not the opposite of *by all means*. It is similar to *definitely not*, or *not by a long way*.

- *‘Is that all you’ve got to say?’ ‘**By no means**.’*
- *Galileo was **by no means** the first person to use a telescope.*
