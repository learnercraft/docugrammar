# miss

## ‘fail to contact’, ‘be late for’

*Miss* often expresses the idea of failing to contact somebody/something, or being late for somebody/something.

- *How could he **miss** an easy goal like that?*
- *The station’s about five minutes’ walk, straight ahead. You can’t **miss** it.*
- *If you don’t hurry we’ll **miss** the train.* (not *~~… lose the train.~~*)
- *You’ve just **missed** her – she went home five minutes ago.*

An *\-ing* form can be used after *miss*.

- *I got in too late and **missed** **seeing** the news on TV.*

## ‘be sorry to be without’

We can use *miss* to say that we are sorry because we are no longer with somebody, or no longer have something.

- *Will you **miss** me when I’m away?*
- *He’s not happy in the country – he **misses** city life.*

Note that *regret* is not used in the same way. Compare:

- *I **miss** working with you.* (= I’m sorry I’m no longer with you.)
- *I **regret** working with you.* (= I’m sorry I was with you.)

## ‘notice the absence of’

Another meaning of *miss* is ‘notice that somebody/something is not there’.

## *miss* not used

*Miss* is not used simply to say that somebody has not got something.

- *In some of the villages they **haven’t got** electricity.* (not *~~… they miss electricity.~~*)

In a formal style, the verb or noun *lack* can be used to express this idea.

- *… they **lack** electricity.*
- *I am sorry that **lack** of time prevents me from giving more details.*

## *missing*

*Missing* is often used as an adjective, meaning ‘lost’.

- *When did you realise that the money was **missing**?*
- *The **missing** children were found at their aunt’s house.*

We can use *missing* after a noun. This often happens in clauses beginning with *there is*.

- *There’s **a page missing** from this book.*

In an informal style, a structure with *have … missing* is also possible.

- *We’**ve** got some plates **missing** – do you think Luke’s borrowed them?*
- *He **had** several teeth **missing**.*
