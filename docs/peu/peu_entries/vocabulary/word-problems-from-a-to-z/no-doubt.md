# no doubt

*No doubt* expresses a personal opinion. It means‘probably’ or ‘I suppose’; it does not mean ‘certainly’.

- ***No doubt** it’ll rain soon.*
- *You’re tired, **no doubt**. I’ll make you a cup of tea.*

To say that something is certain, we can use *there is no doubt that* (formal), *without any doubt* (formal), *certainly*, *definitely*.

- ***There is no doubt that** the world is getting warmer.* (not *~~No doubt the world is getting warmer.~~*)
- *Cycling is **certainly** healthier than driving.* (not *~~No doubt cycling is healthier than driving.~~*)

*Doubtless* is similar to *no doubt* (but more formal); *undoubtedly* is similar to *there is no doubt that*.

For structures with the verb *doubt*, [(see here)](./doubt).
