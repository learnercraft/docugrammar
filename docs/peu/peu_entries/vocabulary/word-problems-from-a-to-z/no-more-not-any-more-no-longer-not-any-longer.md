# no more, not any more, no longer, not any longer

We use *no more* with nouns to talk about quantity or degree – to say how much.

- *There’s **no more** bread.*

We do not use *no more* in standard modern English as an adverb to express the idea of actions and situations stopping. Instead, we use *no longer* (usually before the verb), *not … any longer* or *not … any more*.

- *I **no longer** support the Conservative party.* (not *~~I no more support …~~*)
- *This **can’t** go on **any longer**.*
- *I’m **not** helping you **any more**.*

*Anymore* may be written as one word, especially in American English.

- *Annie doesn’t live here **anymore**.*
