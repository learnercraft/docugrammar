# once: adverb

When *once* means ‘at some time’, we use it for the past but not for the future. To refer to an indefinite future time, we can use *sometime* or *one day*. Compare:

- *I met her **once** in Venezuela.*  
  ***Once** upon a time there was a beautiful princess.*
- *Come up and see me **sometime**.* (not *~~Come up and see me once.~~*)  
  *We must go walking **one day**.* (not *~~We must go walking once.~~*)

When *once* has the more precise meaning of ‘one time (not twice or three times)’, it can be used to talk about any time, including the future.

- *I’m only going to say this **once**.*

Note that *at once* means ‘immediately’.

- *‘Can I have the bill?’ ‘**At once**, sir.’*
