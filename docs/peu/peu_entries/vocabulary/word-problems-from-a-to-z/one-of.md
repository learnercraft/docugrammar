# one of …

After *one of* we normally use a plural form.

- *one of our **cats*** (not *~~one of our cat~~*)

Occasionally *one of* is used with a singular noun referring to a group.

- *Why don’t you ask **one of the crew**?*

A following verb is normally singular.

- *One of our cats **has** disappeared.* (not *~~One of our cats have disappeared.~~*)

After *one of*, a noun phrase must have a determiner (e.g. *the*, *my*, *those*).

- ***one of the**/**my**/**those** horses* (but not *~~one of horses~~*)

*Of* cannot be dropped.

- ***one of** my friends* (not *~~one my friend~~*) or *~~one my friends~~*
