# own

## After possessives

We only use *own* after a possessive word. It cannot directly follow an article.

- *It’s nice if a child can have **his or her own** room.* (not *~~… an own room.~~*)
- *Car rental is expensive. It’s cheaper to take **one’s own** car.* (not *~~… the own car.~~*)
- *I’m **my own** boss.*

## *a/some … of one’s own*

This structure makes it possible to include *a/an*, *some* or another determiner in the phrase.

- *I’d like to have **a car of my own**.*
- *It’s time you found **some friends of your own**.*
- *He’s got **no ideas of his own**.*

## *own* with no following noun

We cannot use *mine*, *yours*, etc with *own*, but we can drop a noun after *my own*, *your own*, etc if the meaning is clear.

- *‘Would you like to use my pen?’ ‘No, thanks. I can only write with **my own**.’* (not *~~… mine own.~~*)

## *own* and *-self*

The emphatic and reflexive pronouns *myself*, *yourself*, etc [(see here)](./../../grammar/pronouns/reflexive-pronouns-myself-etc) do not have possessive forms. *My own*, etc is used instead.

- *I’ll do it **myself**, and I’ll do it in **my own** way.* (not *~~… in myself’s way.~~*)
- *She can wash **herself** and brush **her own** hair now.* (not *~~… brush herself’s hair.~~*)

## *on one’s own*

Note the two meanings of *on one’s own*.

- *My mother lives **on her own**.* (without company)
- *Don’t help him. Let him do it **on his own**.* (without help)

:::note

For *by oneself* used in similar ways, [(see here)](./../../grammar/pronouns/reflexive-pronouns-myself-etc#by-oneself).
