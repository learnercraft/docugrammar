# part

*A* is usually dropped before *part of* if there is no adjective.

- ***Part of** the roof was missing.* (``BUT`` **A large part* of the roof was missing.*)
- ***Part of** the trouble is that I can’t see very well.* (More natural than *A part of the trouble …*)
- *Jess was in Australia **part of** last year.*
