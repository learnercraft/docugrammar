# please and thank you

## Requests

We use *please* to make requests more polite.

- *Could I have some more rice, **please**?*
- *‘Would you like some help?’ ‘Yes, **please**.’*

Note that *please* does not change an order into a request. Compare:

- *Stand over there.* (order)
- ***Please** stand over there.* (more polite order)
- *Could you stand over there, **please**?* (polite request)

*Please do* is a rather formal answer to a request for permission.

- *‘Do you mind if I open the window?’ ‘**Please do**.’*

## When *please* is not used

We do not use *please* to ask people what they have said.

- *‘I’ve got a bit of a headache.’ ‘**I beg your pardon**?’* (not *~~… Please?~~*)

We do not use *please* when we give things to people.

- *‘Have you got a pen I could use?’ ‘Yes, **here you are**.’* (not *~~… Please.~~*)

*Please* is not used as an answer to *Thank you* (see below).

- *‘Thanks a lot.’ ‘**That’s OK’**  .* (not *~~… Please.~~*)

## *thank you* and *thanks*

*Thanks* is more informal than *thank you*. Common expressions:

- *Thank you.* (not *~~Thanks you.~~*)
- *Thanks very much.*
- *Thank you very much.*
- *Thanks a lot.* (but not *~~Thank you a lot.~~*)
- *Thank God it’s Friday.* (not *~~Thanks God …~~*)

*Indeed* [(see here)](./indeed) can be used to strengthen *very much*. This is rather formal.

- *Thank you very much **indeed**.* (but not usually *~~Thank you indeed.~~*)

*Thank you for* / *Thanks for* can be followed by an *\-ing* form. Possessives are unnecessary and are not used.

- *‘**Thank you for coming**.’ ‘Not at all. **Thank you for having** me.’* (not *~~Thank you for your coming.~~*)

Some British people say *Cheers* (informal) to mean *Thanks*.

## Accepting and refusing

We often use *Thank you* / *Thanks* like *Yes*, *please*, to accept offers.

- *‘Would you like some potatoes?’ ‘**Thank you**.’ ‘How many?’*

To make it clear that one wishes to refuse something, it is normal to say *No*, *thank you* / *No*, *thanks*.

- *‘Another cake?’ ‘**No**, **thanks**. I’ve eaten too many already.’*

*Yes*, *thanks* is most often used to confirm that things are all right.

- *‘Have you got enough potatoes?’ ‘**Yes**, **thanks**.’*

## Replies to thanks

In English, there is not an automatic answer to *Thank you*; British people, especially, do not usually answer when they are thanked for small things. If a reply is necessary, we can say *Not at all* (rather formal), *You’re welcome*, *That’s (quite) all right* or *That’s OK* (informal). Some people say *No problem* (informal). Compare:

- *‘Could you pass the salt?’ ‘Here you are.’ ‘Thanks.’* (no answer)
- *‘Here’s your coat.’ ‘Thanks.’* (no answer)
- *‘Thanks so much for looking after the children.’ ‘**That’s all right. Any time**.’* (answer necessary)
