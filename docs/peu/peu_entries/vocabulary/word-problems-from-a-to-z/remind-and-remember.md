# remind and remember

## Meaning: *remind* and *remember*

These two verbs are not the same. *Reminding* somebody means ‘making somebody remember’. Compare:

- ***Remind** me to call Andy.* (not *~~Remember me to call …~~*)  
  *I’m afraid I won’t **remember** to call Andy.*
- *This sort of weather **reminds** me of my home.* (not *~~This sort of weather remembers me …~~*)  
  *This sort of weather makes me **remember** my home.*

But note the special use of *remember* in ***Remember** me to your parents* (= ‘Give my best wishes to your parents’) and similar sentences.

:::note

For *remember* + *\-ing* form or infinitive, [(see here)](./../../grammar/infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/infinitives-or-ing-forms-both-possible-with-different-uses#remember-and-forget)

:::

## Structures

After *remind*, we can use an infinitive structure (for actions) or a *that*\-clause (for facts).

- *Please **remind me to go** to the bank.* (not *~~Please remind me of going …~~*)
- *I **reminded him that** we hadn’t got any bread left.*

## *remind … of …*

We use *remind … of* to say that something/somebody makes us remember the past, or things that have been forgotten.

- *The smell of hay always **reminds** me **of** our old house in the country.* (not *~~… reminds me our old house …~~*)
- ***Remind** me **of** your phone number.*

We can also use *remind … of* to talk about similarities.

- *She **reminds** me **of** her mother.* (= She is like her mother.)
