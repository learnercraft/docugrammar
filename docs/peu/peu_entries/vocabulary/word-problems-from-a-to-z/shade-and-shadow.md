# shade and shadow

*Shade* is protection from the sun.

- *I’m hot. Let’s find some **shade** to sit in.*
- *The temperature’s 30 degrees in the **shade**.*

A *shadow* is the ‘picture’ made by something that blocks out light.

- *In the evening your **shadow** is longer than you are.*
- *There’s an old story about a man without a **shadow**.*
