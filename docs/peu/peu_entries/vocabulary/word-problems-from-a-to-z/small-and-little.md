# small and little

*Small* simply refers to size. It is the opposite of *big* or *large* [(see here)](./big-large-and-great).

- *Could I have a **small** brandy, please?*
- *You’re too **small** to be a police officer.*

The adjective *little* usually expresses some kind of emotion.

- ***Poor little** thing – come here and let me look after you.*
- *‘What’s he like?’ ‘Oh, he’s a **funny little** man.’*
- *What’s that **nasty little** boy doing in our garden?*
- *They’ve bought a **pretty little** house in the country.*

In a few fixed expressions, *little* is used in the same way as *small* or *short*.

- ***little** finger*
- *the **little** hand of a clock*
- *a **little** while*
- *a **little** way*

In British English *little* is unusual in ‘predicative’ position (after a verb), and comparative and superlative forms are not normally used.

- *The puppy was so **small** and sweet.* (More natural in British English than *The puppy was so little …*)
- *He’s the **smallest** baby I’ve ever seen.* (More natural than *… the littlest baby …*)

:::note

For *little* used as a determiner meaning ‘not much’ (e.g. *There’s little hope*), [(see here)](./../../grammar/determiners-quantifiers/a-little-and-a-few).
