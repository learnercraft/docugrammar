# so: adverb meaning ‘like this/that’

## After *seem*, *appear*, etc

*So* can be used in a formal style in a few cases to mean ‘like this/that’, ‘in this/that way’. This happens, for example, after *seem*, *appear*, *remain*, *more* and *less*.

- *‘Will the business make a loss this year?’ ‘It **appears so**.’*
- *The weather is stormy, and will **remain so** over the weekend.*
- *She was always nervous, and after her accident she became even **more so**.*
- *I read the front page very carefully, and the rest of the paper **less so**.*

## Not used in other cases

In other cases, *so* is not normally used adverbially to mean ‘like this/that’, ‘in this/that way’.

- *Look – hold it up in the air **like this**.* (not *~~… hold it up in the air so.~~*)
- *When he laughs **like that** I want to scream.* (not *~~When he laughs so …~~*)
- *I don’t think we should do it **in that way**.* (not *~~… do it so.~~*)
- *He says he is ill and he looks **it**.* (not *~~… he looks so.~~*)
