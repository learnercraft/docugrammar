# speak and talk

## Little difference

There is little difference between *speak* and *talk*. In certain situations one or the other is preferred, but they are usually both possible.

## Formality

*Talk* is the more usual word for informal communication.

- *When she walked into the room everybody stopped **talking**.*
- *Could I **talk** to you about my plans for a few minutes?*

*Speak* is often used for communication in more serious or formal situations.

- *I’ll have to **speak** to that boy – he’s getting very lazy.*
- *They had a fight last week, and now they’re not **speaking** to one another.*
- *After she had finished explaining her plans, nobody **spoke**.*

## Lectures, etc

*Talk* is often used for the act of giving an informal lecture (a *talk*); *speak* is preferred for more formal lectures, sermons, etc. Compare:

- *This is Patrick Allen, who’s going to **talk** to us about gardening.*
- *This is Professor Rosalind Bowen, who is going to **speak** to us on recent developments in low-temperature physics.*
- *The Pope **spoke** to the crowd for seventy minutes about world peace.*

## Languages

*Speak* is the usual word to refer to knowledge and use of languages, and to the physical ability to speak.

- *She **speaks** three languages fluently.*
- *We **spoke** Dutch so that the children wouldn’t understand.*
- *His throat operation has left him unable to **speak**.*

## Other cases

One usually asks to *speak to* somebody on the phone (AmE also *speak with*).

- *Hello. Could I **speak to** Karen, please?*

*Talk* is used before *sense*, *nonsense* and other words with similar meanings.

- *You’re **talking** complete **nonsense**, as usual.* (not *~~You’re speaking complete nonsense …~~*)
