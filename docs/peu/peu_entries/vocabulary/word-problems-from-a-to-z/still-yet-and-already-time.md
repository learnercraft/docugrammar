# still, yet and already: time

## Meanings

*Still*, *yet* and *already* can all be used to talk about things which are going on, or expected, around the present. Briefly:

- *still* is used to say that something is continuing and has not stopped
- *yet* is used to talk about something that is expected
- *already* is used to say that something has happened early, or earlier than it might have happened.

## *still*

*Still* is used to say that something has, perhaps surprisingly, not finished.

- *She’s **still** asleep.*
- *Is it **still** raining?*
- *I’ve been thinking for hours, but I **still** can’t decide.*
- *You’re not **still** seeing that Jackson boy, are you?*

*Still* usually goes with the verb, in ‘mid-position’ [(see here)](./../../grammar/adverbs-and-adverbials/mid-position-details).

## *yet*

*Not yet* is used to say that something which is expected has not happened (but we think that it will).

- *‘Is Sophie here?’ ‘**Not yet**.’*
- *The mail has**n’t** come **yet**.*

In questions, we use *yet* to ask whether something expected has happened.

- *Is supper ready **yet**?*
- *Has the mail come **yet**?*

*Yet* usually goes at the end of a clause, but it can go immediately after *not* in a formal style.

- *Don’t eat the pears – they aren’t ripe **yet**.*
- *The pears are **not yet** ripe.* (more formal)

## *already*

*Already* is used to say that something has happened earlier than expected, or earlier than it might have happened.

- *‘When’s Sophie going to come?’ ‘She’s **already** here.’*
- *‘You must go to Scotland.’ ‘I’ve **already** been there.’*
- *Have you **already** finished? That was quick!*

*Already* usually goes with the verb, in ‘mid-position’ [(see here)](./../../grammar/adverbs-and-adverbials/mid-position-details). It can also go at the end of a clause, for emphasis.

- *Are you here **already**? You must have run all the way.*

We do not usually put *already* before time expressions.

- ***When I was fourteen** I **already** knew that I wanted to be a doctor.* (not *~~Already when I was fourteen …~~*)

## *still not* or *not yet*?

*Still not* looks back towards the past; *not yet* looks towards the future.

Compare:

- *She **still** has**n’t** got a job.* (Looking back: she hasn’t had a job for a long time, and this situation is continuing.)  
  *She has**n’t** got a job **yet**.* (Looking forward: she hasn’t got a job now, but we’re hoping that she will get one.)
- *I **still** ca**n’t** speak Russian, after all these years of study.*  
  *I ca**n’t** speak French **yet**, but I hope I will be able to soon.*

## *yet* or *already* in questions

Questions with *already* often suggest that something has happened. Compare:

- *Have you met Professor Hawkins **yet**?* (= I don’t know whether you’ve met him.)  
  *Have you **already** met Professor Hawkins?* (= I think you’ve probably met him.)
- *Is my coat dry **yet**?*  
  *Is my coat dry **already**? That was quick!*

## Tenses

Various tenses are possible with all three words. In British English, perfect tenses are common with *already* and *yet*; Americans often use past tenses. Compare:

- ****Have** you **paid** yet?* (BrE)*  
  ***Have** you **paid** / **Did** you **pay** yet?* (AmE)
- *She **has** already **left**.* (BrE)  
  *She **(has)** already **left**.* (AmE)

## Related to a past moment

All three words can be related to a past moment instead of to the present.

- *I went to see if she had woken up **yet**, but she was **still** asleep. This was embarrassing, because her friends had **already** arrived.*

## *yet* meaning ‘still’

*Yet* is normally used in questions and negative sentences. But it is sometimes used in affirmative sentences in a formal style to mean ‘still’.

- *We have **yet** to hear from the bank.* (= We are still waiting to hear …)

## *all ready*

*All ready* is not the same as *already*: it simply means the same as *all* + *ready*. Compare:

- *‘When’s Megan coming?’ ‘She’s **already** arrived.’*
- *‘Are you **all ready**?’ ‘No, Dan isn’t.’*
