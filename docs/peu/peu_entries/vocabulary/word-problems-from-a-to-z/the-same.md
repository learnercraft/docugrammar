# (the) same

## *the same (as)*

We normally use *the* before *same*.

- *Give me **the same** again, please.* (not *~~Give me same again, please.~~*)

In a comparison, we use *the same (…) as*.

- *You’ve got **the same** idea **as** me.* (not *~~… my same idea.~~*)
- *Her hair’s **the same** colour **as** her mother’s.* (not *~~… the same colour like …~~*)

Note the expression *the very same (= exactly the same)*.

- *Our birthdays are on **the very same** day.*

## Other structures

Before a clause, *the same … that* or *the same … who* can be used.

- *That’s **the same** man **that**/**who** asked me for money yesterday.*

*As* is also possible before a clause, especially with a noun that is the object of the following verb.

- *He’s wearing **the same** shirt **that**/**as** he had on yesterday.*

*As*/*who*/*that* can be left out when they refer to the object of the following verb.

- *He’s wearing **the same shirt he had** on yesterday.*

Note also the expression *do the same*.

- *Why do you always try to **do the same** as your brother?*
- *Joe and Kate went on a camping trip, and we’re going to **do the same**.*
