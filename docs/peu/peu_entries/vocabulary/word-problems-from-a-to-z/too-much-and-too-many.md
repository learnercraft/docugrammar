# too much and too many

## The difference

The difference between *too much* and *too many* is the same as the difference between *much* and *many* [(see here)](./../../grammar/determiners-quantifiers/much-and-many). *Too much* is used with singular (uncountable) nouns; *too many* is used with plurals.

- *You put **too much salt** in the soup.*
- *I’ve had **too many** late **nights** recently.* (not *~~… too much late nights …~~*)

## *a bit too much*, *rather too many*, etc

Expressions which modify comparatives [(see here)](./../../grammar/comparison/much-older-by-far-the-oldest-etc) and *too* can also modify *too much* and *too many*.

- *She’s wearing **a bit too much** make-up for my taste.*
- *I’ve been to **rather too many** parties recently.*

However, *much too many* is unusual.

- *You ask **far too many** questions.* (not *~~… much too many questions.~~*)

## *too much*/*many* without a noun

We can drop a noun after *too much*/*many*, if the meaning is clear.

- *You’ve eaten **too much**.*
- *‘Did you get any answers to your advertisement?’ ‘**Too many**.’*
