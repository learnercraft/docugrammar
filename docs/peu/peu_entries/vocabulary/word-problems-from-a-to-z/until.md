# until

## *until* and *till*

These two words can be used both as prepositions and conjunctions. They mean exactly the same. *Till* (AmE also *’til* or *til*) is informal.

- *OK, then, I won’t expect you **until**/**till** midnight.*
- *I’ll wait **until**/**till** I hear from you.*
- *The new timetable will remain in operation **until June 30**.*

## *until*/*till* and *to*

*To* can sometimes be used as a preposition of time with the same meaning as *until*/*till*. This happens after *from …*

- *I usually work **from** nine **to** five.* (or … **from** nine **until**/**till** five.)

We can also use *to* when counting the time until a future event.

- *It’s another three weeks **to** my birthday.* (or … **until**/**till my birthday.**)

In other cases, *to* is not generally used.

- *I waited for her **until** six o’clock, but she didn’t come.* (not *~~I waited for her to six o’clock …~~*)

:::note

For American English *from … through*, [(see here)](./through-time).

## Distance and quantity: *until*/*till* not used

*Until*/*till* is used only to talk about time. To talk about distance, we use *to*, *as far as* or *up to*; *up to* is also used to talk about quantity.

- *We walked **as far as**/**up to** the edge of the forest.* (not *~~… till the edge …~~*)
- *The minibus can hold **up to** thirteen people.* (not *~~… until thirteen people.~~*)
- *You can earn **up to** £1,500 a week in this job.*

## Tenses with *until*

Present tenses are used to refer to the future after *until* [(see here)](./../../grammar/conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/tense-simplification-in-subordinate-clauses).

- *I’ll wait **until** she **gets** here.* (not *~~… until she will get here.~~*)

Present perfect and past perfect tenses can emphasise the idea of completion.

- *You’re not going home **until** you’**ve finished** that report.*
- *I waited **until** the rain **had stopped**.*

## Structure with *Not until …*

In a literary style it is possible to begin a sentence with *Not until …*, using inverted word order in the main clause [(see here)](./../../grammar/information-structure/inversion-auxiliary-verb-before-subject).

- ***Not until** that evening **was she** able to recover her self-control.*
- ***Not until** I left home **did I** begin to understand how strange my family was.*

## *until* and *by*: states and actions

We use *until* to talk about a situation or state that will continue up to a certain moment. We use *by* [(see here)](./by-time) to say that an action or event will happen at or before a future moment. Compare:

- *Can I stay **until the weekend**?*  
  *Yes, but you’ll have to leave **by twelve on Monday** at the latest.* (= at twelve on Monday or before)
- *Can you repair my watch if I leave it **until Saturday**?*  
  *No, but we can do it **by next Tuesday**.* (not *~~… until next Tuesday.~~*)

## *until* and *before*

*Not until*/*till* can mean the same as *not before*.

- *I won’t be seeing Judy **until**/**before** Tuesday.*

And both *until* and *before* can be used to say how far away a future event is.

- *It’ll be ages **until**/**before** we meet again.*
- *There’s only six weeks left **until**/**before** Christmas.*
