# -ward(s)

*Backward(s)*, *forward(s)*, *northward(s)*, *outward(s)* and similar words can be used as adjectives or adverbs.

## Adjectives

When they are used as adjectives, they do not have *\-s*.

- *This country is very **backward** in some ways.*
- *You’re not allowed to make a **forward** pass in rugby.*
- *He was last seen driving in a **northward** direction.*

## Adverbs

When these words are adverbs, they can generally be used with or without *\-s*. The forms with *\-s* are generally a little more common in British English, and the forms without *\-s* in American English.

- *Why are you moving **backward(s)** and **forward(s)**?*
- *If we keep going **upward(s)**, we must get to the top.*
- *Let’s start driving **homeward(s)**.*

In some figurative expressions such as *look forward to*, *bring forward*, *put forward*, the form without *\-s* is always used.

- *I **look forward to** hearing from you.*
- *She **put forward** a very interesting suggestion.*

## Other words

*Towards* and *afterwards* are the usual forms in British English; in American English, *toward* and *afterward* are also common.
