# well

## *well* and *good*

*Well* and *good* can have similar meanings, but in this case *well* is an adverb, while *good* is an adjective. Compare:

- *The car runs **well**.* (adverb modifying *runs*) (not *~~The car runs good.~~*)  
  *It’s a **well**\-made car.* (adverb modifying *made*)
  *It’s a **good** car.* (adjective modifying *car*)
- *He teaches very **well**.*  
  *I like that teacher. He’s **good**.* (not *~~He’s well.~~*)
- *She speaks English **well**.* (not *~~She speaks English good.~~*)  
  *She speaks **good** English.*
  *Her English is **good**.*

Note that we cannot say **~~She speaks well English~~**. (Adverbs cannot usually go between the verb and the object, [(see here)](../../grammar/adverbs-and-adverbials/position-of-adverbials-introduction#verb-and-object-she-speaks-english-well).)

## *well* = ‘in good health’

There is also an adjective *well*, meaning ‘in good health’.

- *‘How are you?’ ‘Quite **well**, thanks.’*
- *I don’t feel very **well**.*

Note that the adjective *well* is only used to talk about health. Compare:

- *When I’m in the mountains I am always **well**.*
- *When I’m with you I’m **happy**.* (not *~~When I’m with you I’m well.~~*)

*Well* is not common before a noun. We can say *She’s well*, but it is less usual to say, for example, *She’s a well girl*.

## *I’m good.*

*I’m good* is now often used informally to mean ‘I’m OK’, especially when refusing an offer.

- *‘More coffee?’ ‘No, **I’m good**, thanks.’*
- *‘Want help?’ ‘It’s OK – **I’m good**.’*
