# when and if

A person who says *when* (referring to the future) is sure that something will happen. A person who says *if* is unsure whether it will happen. Compare:

- *I’ll see you at Christmas **when** we’re all at Sophie’s place.* (We are certain to be at Sophie’s place.)
- *I’ll see you in August **if** I come to New York.* (Perhaps I’ll come to New York, perhaps not.)

To talk about repeated, predictable situations and events (in the sense of

‘whenever’), both *when* and *if* can be used with little difference of meaning.

- ***When**/**If** you heat ice it turns to water.*
- ***When**/**If** I’m in Liverpool I usually stay with my sister.*
