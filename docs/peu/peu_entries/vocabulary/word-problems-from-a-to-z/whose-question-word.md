# whose: question word

## With a noun or alone

The question word *whose* can be used with a noun as a determiner, like *my*, *your*, etc.

- ***Whose** car is that outside?*
- ***Whose** garden do you think looks the nicest?*

*Whose* can also be used alone, like *mine*, *yours*, etc.

- ***Whose** is that car outside?*
- *‘**Whose** is this?’ ‘Mine.’*

## Prepositions

Prepositions can normally come either before *whose* (more formal) or at the end of the clause (less formal). [(see here)](./../../grammar/prepositions/prepositions-at-the-ends-of-clauses) for details.

- ***For whose** benefit were all these changes made?*
- ***Whose** side are you **on**?*

In short questions with no verb, prepositions can only come before *whose*.

- *‘I’m going to buy a car.’ ‘**With whose** money?’* (not *~~Whose money with?~~*)

:::note

For the relative pronoun *whose*, [(see here)](./../../grammar/relative-clauses/whose).
