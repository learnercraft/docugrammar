# why and why not

## Replies

We generally use *Why not?*, not *Why?*, in short replies to negative statements. Compare:

- *‘They’ve decided to move to Devon.’ ‘**Why?’***
- *‘I can’t manage tomorrow evening.’ ‘**Why not?’*** (More natural than *Why?*)

*Why not?* can also be used to agree to a suggestion.

- *‘Let’s eat out this evening.’ ‘Yes, **why not**?’*

## *Why should …?*

A structure with *why* followed by *should* can suggest surprise.

- *I wonder **why** she **should** want to go out with me.*

The structure can also suggest anger or refusal to do something.

- *I don’t see **why** we **should** have to pay for your mistake.*
- *‘Give me a cigarette.’ ‘**Why should** I?’*

For a similar structure with *how*, [(see here)](./../../grammar/speech-and-spoken-exchanges/rhetorical-questions-who-cares#whyhow-should-).

## Infinitive structures

*Why* can be followed by an infinitive without *to*. This structure can suggest that an action is unnecessary or pointless.

- ***Why argue** with him? He’ll never change his mind.* (not *~~Why arguing …?~~*) or *~~Why to argue …?~~*
- ***Why pay** more at other shops? We have the best value.*

*Why not* + infinitive without *to* is used to make suggestions.

- *‘Sandy’s in a bad mood.’ ‘**Why not give** her some flowers?’*

*Why don’t …?* can be used in the same way.

- ***Why don’t you give** her some flowers?*
- ***Why don’t we go** and see Julie?*
