# with

## *trembling with rage*, *blue with cold*, etc

*With* is used in a number of expressions which say how people are showing their emotions and sensations.

- *My father was trembling **with** rage.*
- *Annie was jumping up and down **with** excitement.*
- *When I found her she was blue **with** cold.*
- *white **with** fear/rage*
- *red **with** anger/embarrassment*
- *green **with** envy*
- *shivering **with** cold*

## *angry with*, etc

*With* is also used after a number of adjectives which say how people are feeling towards others.

- *I’m cross **with** you.*
- *angry **with***
- *furious **with***
- *pleased **with***
- *upset **with***

After words which say how people act towards others (like *kind*, *nice*, *polite*, *rude*, *good*), we generally use *to*, not *with*.

- *She was very **nice to** me.* (not *~~… nice with me.~~*)

## *with* meaning ‘against’

After *fight*, *struggle*, *quarrel*, *argue*, *play* and words with similar meanings, *with* can be used with the same meaning as *against*.

- *Don’t **fight with** him – he’s bigger than you are.*
- *Will you **play** chess **with** me?*

## Accompanying circumstances and reasons

*With* can introduce accompanying circumstances or reasons (rather like *and there is*/*was* or *because there is*/*was*).

- *The runners started the race **with a light following wind**.*
- ***With all this work to do**, I won’t have time to go out.*
- ***With friends like you**, who needs enemies?*

*Without* can be used in similar ways.

- ***Without Emma and Jake**, we’re going to have trouble finishing the repairs.*

## Possession

*With* is very often used, like *have*, to indicate possession and similar ideas.

- *There are so many people around **with no homes**.* (= … who have no homes.)
- *They’ve bought a house **with a big garden**.*

## Clothing, voices, transport, etc

Note that *in* is often used instead of *with* to refer to articles of clothing.

- *Who’s the man **in the funny hat**?*
- *Could you go and give this paper to the woman **in glasses**?*

We say *in a … voice*, not *~~with a … voice~~*.

- *Why are you talking **in such a loud voice**?*

Note also: ***by** car/train*, etc (not *~~with the car, etc~~*), and *write **in** pencil/ink*.

:::note

For the difference between *by* and *with*, [(see here)](./by-method-agent-and-with-tools-etc).
