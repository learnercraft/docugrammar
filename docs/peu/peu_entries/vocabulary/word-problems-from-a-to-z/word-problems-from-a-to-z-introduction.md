# Introduction

This Section deals with a number of words which often cause problems to do with meaning and grammar. Some other words are more conveniently explained in the grammatical Sections: search the Index for references.

Note that a general usage guide like this only has room to cover a limited selection of word problems. For a wider and more detailed treatment, a separate reference book is needed.
