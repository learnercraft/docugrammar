# Adjectives: normal position

## Two positions

Most adjectives can go in two main places in a sentence.

1. with a noun, usually before it. This is called ‘attributive position’.

    - *The **new secretary** doesn’t like me.*
    - *He’s going out with a **rich businesswoman**.*

    In older English [(see here)](./../varieties-of-english/changes-in-english#older-english-verb-forms-tell-me-what-thou-knowest), it was quite common to put adjectives after nouns, especially in poetry and songs.

    - *He came from his **palace grand**.*

    In modern English, this only happens in a few cases.

    :::note

    For adjectives before personal pronouns (e.g. *Poor you!*), [(see here)](./../pronouns/personal-pronouns-advanced-points#poor-you).

    :::
2. after *be*, *seem*, *look*, *become* and other linking verbs [(see here)](./../verbs/linking-verbs-be-seem-look-etc). This is called ‘predicative position’.

    - *That dress **is new**, isn’t it?*
    - *She **looks rich**.*
    - *I **feel unhappy**.*

## Adjectives used only before nouns

Some adjectives are used only (or mostly) before nouns. After verbs, other words must be used. Common examples:

*elder* and *eldest* Compare:

- *My **elder** sister is a pilot.*
- *She’s three years **older** than me.*

*live* /laɪv/ (meaning ‘not dead’) Compare:

- *a **live** fish*
- *It’s still **alive**.*

*old* (referring to relationships that have lasted a long time)

- *an **old** friend* (not the same as a friend who is **old**)

*little* (in BrE: [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/small-and-little) Compare:

- *a nice **little** house*
- *The house is quite **small**.*

Some others:

- *He’s a **mere** child.* (but not *~~That child is mere.~~*)
- *It’s **sheer** madness.* (but not *~~That madness is sheer.~~*)
- *You **bloody** fool!* (but not *~~That fool is bloody.~~*)
- *I was studying for my **future** career as a lawyer.* (but not *~~My career as a lawyer was future.~~*)
- *This is the **main** problem!* (but not *~~This problem is main.~~*)

## Adjectives used only after verbs

Some adjectives beginning with *a*\-, and a few others, are used mainly after linking verbs, especially *be*. Common examples: *ablaze*, *afloat*, *afraid*, *alight*, *alike*, *alive*, *alone*, *asleep*, *awake*. Compare:

- *The baby’s **asleep**.*  
  *a **sleeping** baby* (not *~~an asleep baby~~*)

- *The ship’s still **afloat**.*  
  *a **floating** leaf*

- *He was **afraid**.*  
  *a **frightened** man*

The adjectives *ill* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/ill-and-sick) and *well* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/well) are most common after verbs. Before nouns, many people prefer other words. Compare:

- *He’s very **well**.*  
  *a **healthy/fit** man*

- *You look **ill**.*  
  *Nurses take care of **sick** people.*

## Verb + object + adjective

Another possible position for adjectives is after the object, in the structure verb + object + adjective.

- *I’ll **get the car ready**.*
- *Do I **make you happy**?*
- *Let’s **paint the kitchen yellow**.*
