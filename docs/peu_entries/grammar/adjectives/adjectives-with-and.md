# Adjectives with *and*

When two or more adjectives (or other modifiers) come together, we sometimes put *and* before the last one, and sometimes not. It depends partly on their position in the sentence, and partly the kinds of information they give.

## After a verb

When adjectives come in predicative position (after *be*, *seem* and similar verbs, [(see here)](./../verbs/linking-verbs-be-seem-look-etc), we usually put *and* before the last one.

- *He was tall, dark **and** handsome.*
- *You’re like a winter’s day: short, dark **and** dirty.*

In a very literary style, *and* is sometimes left out.

- *My soul is exotic, mysterious, incomprehensible.*

## Before a noun

In attributive position (before a noun), *and* is less common.

- *a **big beautiful** garden*

However, *and* is possible when the adjectives give similar kinds of information, especially when we are ‘piling up’ favourable or unfavourable descriptions.

- *a **cruel (and) vicious** tyrant*
- *a **warm (and) generous** personality*
- *an **ill-planned**, **expensive (and) wasteful** project*

*And* is necessary when two or more adjectives (or other modifiers) refer to different parts of something, or distinguish different types of thing.

- *a **yellow and black** sports car*
- *a **concrete and glass** factory*
- ***hot and cold** drinks* (= hot drinks and cold drinks)

We also use *and* when we say that something belongs to two or more different classes.

- *It’s a **social and political** problem.*
- *She’s a **musical and artistic** genius.*

## And not used

We do not use *and* between adjectives that give different kinds of information.

- *an **angry young** man* (not *~~an angry and young man~~*)
- *a **ridiculous economic** policy* (not *~~a ridiculous and economic policy~~*)

## *nice and …*

In an informal style, the expression *nice and* is often used before another adjective or an adverb. It means something like ‘pleasantly’ or ‘suitably’.

- *It’s **nice and warm** in front of the fire.* (= pleasantly warm)

- *The work was **nice and easy**.*
- *Now just put your gun down **nice and slow**.*
