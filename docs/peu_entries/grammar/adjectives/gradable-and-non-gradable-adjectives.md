# Gradable and non-gradable adjectives

Adjectives can be divided into **gradable** and **non-gradable**. Gradable adjectives (e.g. *difficult*, *important*, *happy*, *tired*) are words for qualities that exist in different degrees. Things can be **more or less** difficult or important; people can be more or less happy or tired. Non-gradable adjectives (e.g. *impossible*, *essential*, *alive*, *exhausted*) are words for **‘either-or’** qualities. We don’t generally say that some things are more impossible than others, or that somebody is not very exhausted: things are either impossible or not, and people are either exhausted or not.

Degree adverbs like *very* or *more* are mostly used with gradable adjectives, and it is mainly gradable adjectives that have comparative and superlative forms.

Note that *quite* has different meanings in British English with gradable and non-gradable adjectives [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/quite).
