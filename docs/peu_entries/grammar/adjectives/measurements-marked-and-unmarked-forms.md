# Measurements: ‘marked’ and ‘unmarked’ forms

Many adjectives that are used in measurements come in pairs (e.g. *tall/short*, *old/young*, *heavy/light*, *fast/slow*). The word that is used for the ‘top’ end of the measurement scale can usually be used in another sense, to talk about the quality in general. For instance, one can ask how *long* something is even if it is relatively short. Grammarians call these uses ‘unmarked’. Compare:

- *She’s very **tall** and he’s very short.* (marked)  
  *Exactly how **tall** are they both?* (unmarked) (not *~~Exactly how short …~~*)
- *Will you still love me when I’m **old**?* (marked)  
  *He’s only twenty-three years **old**.* (unmarked) (not *~~… years young.~~*)
- *Lead is one of the **heaviest** metals.* (marked)  
  *Scales measure how **heavy** things are.* (unmarked) (not *~~… how light …~~*)

Some nouns are used in similar ‘unmarked’ ways. Compare:

- ***Age** brings wisdom but I’d rather have youth and stupidity.* (marked)  
  *What is her exact **age**?* (unmarked) (not *~~What is her exact youth?~~*)
- *The worst thing about the film was its **length**.* (marked)  
  *What’s the **length** of the runway?* (unmarked) (not *~~What’s the shortness …?~~*)
