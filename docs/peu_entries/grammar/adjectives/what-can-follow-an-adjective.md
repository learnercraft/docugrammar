# What can follow an adjective?

Many adjectives can be followed by ‘complements’ – words and expressions that ‘complete’ their meaning. Not all adjectives are followed by the same kind of complement. Some can be followed by preposition + noun/*\-ing* [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/ing-forms-after-nouns-and-adjectives-tired-of-listening).

- *I’m **interested in cookery**.*
- *I’m **interested in learning** to cook.*

Some can be followed by infinitives [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/infinitives-after-adjectives-pleased-to-see-you).

- *You don’t look **happy to see** me.*
- *The soup is **ready to eat**.*

An infinitive may have its own subject, introduced by *for* [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-other-uses/for-to).

- *I’m anxious **for her to get** a good education.* (= I’m anxious that she should get …)

Some adjectives can be followed by clauses [(see here)](./../noun-clauses-direct-and-indirect-speech/that-clauses).

- *I’m **glad that you were able to come**.*
- *It’s **important that everybody should feel comfortable**.*

And many adjectives can have more than one kind of complement.

- *I’m **pleased about** her promotion.*
- *I’m **pleased to see** you here.*
- *I’m **pleased that we seem to agree**.*

We rarely put adjective + complement before a noun [(see here)](./adjectives-after-nouns-and-pronouns#adjectives-with-complements-people-skilled-in-design).

- *He’s a **difficult** person **to understand**.* (not *~~He’s a difficult to understand person.~~*)

For the structures that are possible with a particular adjective, see a good dictionary.
