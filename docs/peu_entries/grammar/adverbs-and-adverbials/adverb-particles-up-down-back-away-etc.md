# Adverb particles: up, down, back, away, etc

## Adverb particles and prepositions

Words like *down*, *in*, *up* are not always prepositions. Compare:

- *I ran **down** the road.*  
  *Please sit **down**.*
- *Something’s climbing **up** my leg.*  
  *She’s not **up** yet.*
- *He’s **in** his office.*  
  *You can go **in**.*

In the expressions *down the road*, *in his office* and *up my leg*, the words *down*, *in* and *up* are prepositions: they have objects (*the road*, *his office* and *my leg*).

In *sit down*, *go in* and *She’s not up*, the words *down*, *in* and *up* have no objects. They are adverbs, not prepositions.

Small adverbs like these are usually called ‘adverb(ial) particles’. They include *about*, *above*, *across*, *ahead*, *along*, *(a)round*, *aside*, *away*, *back*, *before*, *behind*, *below*, *by*, *down*, *forward*, *home*, *in*, *near*, *off*, *on*, *out*, *over*, *past*, *through*, *under*, *up*. Many words of this kind can be used as both adverb particles and prepositions, but there are some exceptions: for example *back*, *away* (only adverb particles); *from*, *during* (only prepositions).

## Phrasal verbs: *give up*, *break down*

Adverb particles often join together with verbs to make two-word verbs, sometimes with completely new meanings (e.g. *break down*, *put off*, *work out*, *give up*). These are often called ‘phrasal verbs’. For details of their use, [(see here)](./../verbs/two-part-verbs-phrasal-verbs).

## Adverb particles with *be*: *I’m off!*

Adverb particles are often used, rather like adjectives, as complements of the verb *be*.

- *Why are all the lights **on**?*
- *The match will be **over** by 4.30.*
- *Hello! You’re **back**!*
- *I’m **off** – see you later!*

For inverted word order in sentences beginning with an adverb particle (e.g. *Out walked Sarah*), [(see here)](./../information-structure/inversion-full-verb-before-subject).
