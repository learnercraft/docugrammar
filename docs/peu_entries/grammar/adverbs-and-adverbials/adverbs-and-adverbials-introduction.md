# Introduction

The term **adverb** is used for a wide variety of words with different kinds of use: for example *frankly*, *now*, *very*, *right*, *regularly*. Their general function is to modify (add meaning to) sentences, clauses or various parts of clauses (but not nouns).

- ***Frankly**, I think she’s crazy.*
- *You did that **very** well.*
- *Please answer **now**.*
- *She went **right** up the stairs.*
- *When I was a student, I went to the gym **regularly**.*

Other longer expressions can modify sentences, clauses, verbs, etc in the same way as adverbs.

- ***To be honest**, I think she’s crazy.*
- *You did that **quite remarkably** well.*
- *Please answer **right away**.*
- *She went **all the way** up the stairs.*
- *When I was a student, I went to the gym **every day**.*

It can be convenient to use a single word to talk about modifiers of this kind, whether they are adverbs, or longer expressions functioning like adverbs. In this Section they are called ‘**adverbials**’ when necessary. For adverbial clauses (e.g. *When I was a student*), [*Conjunctions, sentences and clauses*](../conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses-introduction), [*if* section](../if/if-introduction), [*Other adverbial clauses*](../other-adverbial-clauses/other-adverbial-clauses-introduction).

Note that not all languages make a grammatical distinction between adverbs and adjectives. This can cause problems for some learners.
