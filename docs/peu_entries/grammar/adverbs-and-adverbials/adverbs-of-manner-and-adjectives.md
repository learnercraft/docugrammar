# Adverbs of manner and adjectives

## Adverbs of manner with verbs: *He sang badly.*

Adverbs of manner typically say how something happens or is done.

Examples: *happily*, *terribly*, *fast*, *badly*, *well*

Adverbs of manner can modify verbs. They should not be confused with adjectives (*happy, terrible*, etc). Adjectives are not used to modify verbs.

- *She **danced happily** into the room.* (not *~~She danced happy …~~*)
- *She **sang badly**.* (not *~~She sang bad.~~*)
- *I don’t **remember** him very **well**.* (not *~~… very good.~~*)

But note that some adjective forms are sometimes used as adverbs in an informal style, especially in American English [(see here)](./adverbs-or-adjectives-confusing-cases#clean).

- *She talks **funny**.*

## Other uses: *terribly cold*

These adverbs can also modify adjectives, past participles, other adverbs and prepositional phrases.
