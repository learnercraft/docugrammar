# Connecting and comment adverbials

Examples of connecting adverbials: *then*, *next*, *after that*, *besides*, *anyway*, *suddenly*, *however*, *as a result*, *on the other hand*These words and expressions show how a clause connects with what came before. Naturally, they generally go in **front position**.

- *I worked until five o’clock. **Then** I went home.*
- ***Next**, I want to say something about the future.*
- ***Suddenly** the door opened.*
- *Some of us want a new system. **However**, not everybody agrees.*
- *It was hard work; **on the other hand**, we really enjoyed the experience.*

Examples of comment adverbials: *fortunately*, *surprisingly*, *in my opinion*, *arguably*, *as you might expect* These adverbials show a speaker’s or writer’s opinion of what he/she is talking about. They, too, most often go in **front position**.

- ***Fortunately**, several people have decided to help us.*
- ***Stupidly**, I did not read the contract before signing it.*
- ***Arguably**, this is her finest novel since ‘Flowers of Doom’.*
- ***As you might expect**, his remarks have attracted widespread criticism.*

Other positions are possible, especially with shorter adverbials.

- *Not everybody, **however**, agrees.*
- *I **stupidly** did not read the contract before signing it.*
