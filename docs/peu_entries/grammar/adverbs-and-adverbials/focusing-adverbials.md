# Focusing adverbials

These adverbials ‘point to’ one part of a clause.

:::tip[Examples]

*also*, *just*, *even*, *only*, *mainly*, *mostly*, *either*, *or*, *neither*, *nor*

:::

They often go in **mid-position**.

- *Your bicycle **just** needs some oil – that’s all.*
- *She **neither** said ‘Thank you’ **nor** looked at me.*
- *He’s been everywhere – he’s **even** been to Antarctica.*
- *We’re **only** going for two days.*
- *She’s my teacher, but she’s **also** my friend.*
- *The people at the meeting were **mainly** scientists.*

Some of these adverbials can also go in other places in a clause, directly before the words they modify. For details, see the entries on each adverbial.

- ***Only you** could do a thing like that.*
- *I feel **really tired**.*
