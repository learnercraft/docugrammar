# Introduction

Simple (one-clause) sentences come in four main types from the point of view of structure:

- **declarative clauses**: typically used for making statements (positive or negative)
  - *Your hair looks nice.*
  - *The government haven’t done it.*

- **interrogative clauses**: typically used for asking questions
  - *Does my hair look OK?*
  - *What haven’t they done this time?*

- **imperative clauses**: typically used for giving instructions, making suggestions, etc
  - *Try cutting it a bit shorter.*
  - *Write to your MP about it.*

- **exclamatory clauses**: typically used (naturally) for exclaiming
  - *What a good idea!*
  - *How optimistic you are!*

Structure and meaning don’t always go together.

- *Your coat’s on the floor.* (= ‘Pick up your coat.’ – declarative for instruction)
- *What do you take me for?* (= ‘I’m not stupid.’ – interrogative for statement)

English has fairly fixed word order, especially in formal writing and speech. The main points are summarised in [(see here)](./sentence-structure-basic-word-order). Other entries in this Section deal separately with the structures used in questions, negatives, imperatives and exclamations. The grammar of more complex clauses and sentences is covered in [(see here)](./../written-texts/academic-writing); some structures mainly found in informal speech are discussed in [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/spoken-sentence-structure). English word order can cause problems for learners whose languages move grammatical elements around more freely. In many languages, sentences frequently start with the **topic** – what is being talked about – whether or not this is the grammatical subject. English, especially formal English, prefers to combine topic and grammatical subject in the same noun phrase, and to put this first in a declarative clause. Informal speech can separate topic and subject more easily, [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/spoken-sentence-structure).
