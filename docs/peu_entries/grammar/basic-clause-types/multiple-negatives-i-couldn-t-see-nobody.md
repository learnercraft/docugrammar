# Multiple negatives: I couldn’t see nobody

## English and other languages

In some languages, a negative idea is expressed both by the verb and by accompanying pronouns or adverbs. In standard English, one negative word is normally enough.

- *I opened the door, but I **couldn’t** see anybody / I **could** see **nobody**.* (not *~~… but I couldn’t see nobody.~~*)
- ***Tell** them **nothing**.* (not *~~Don’t tell them nothing.~~*)
- *Your suggestion **will** help **neither** of us.* (not *~~… won’t help neither …~~*)
- ***Nothing matters** now – everything’s finished.* (not *~~Nothing doesn’t matter …~~*)
- *I’**ve never** understood what she wants.* (not *~~I haven’t never understood …~~*)

## *nobody* and *not anybody*, etc

*Nobody*, *nothing*, *never*, etc are rather emphatic. We often prefer to use *not anybody*, *not anything*, *not ever*, etc. Note that *anybody*, *anything*, *ever*, etc are not themselves negative words [(see here)](./non-affirmative-words-anybody-ever-yet-etc) – they have to be used with *not* to give a negative meaning.

- *I opened the door, but I **couldn’t** see **anybody**.* (not *~~… but I could see anybody.~~*)
- ***Don’t** tell them **anything**.*
- *Your suggestion **won’t** help **either** of us.*

At the beginning of a clause, only *nobody*, *nothing*, etc are used.

- ***Nothing** matters.* (not *~~Not anything matters.~~*)
- ***Nowhere** is safe.*

## Double and multiple negatives and their meaning

Two or more negative words can be used in one clause, but then both words normally have their full meaning. Compare:

- *Say **nothing**.* (= Be silent.)
- ***Don’t** just say **nothing**. Tell us what the problem is.* (= Don’t be silent …)

Multiple negatives are sometimes used instead of simple positive structures for special stylistic effects. This is rather literary; in spoken English it can seem unnatural or old-fashioned.

- ***Not** a day passes when I **don’t** regret **not** having studied music in my youth.* (More natural: *Every day I regret not having studied music when I was younger*. ``or`` *I wish I had studied music when I was younger.*)

## Dialects

In many British, American and other dialects, two or more negatives can be used with a single negative meaning.

- *I **ain’t** seen **nobody**.* (Standard English: *I haven’t seen anybody*.)
- *I **ain’t** **never** done **nothing** to **nobody**, and I **ain’t** **never** got **nothing** from **nobody** **no** time.* (American song by Bert Williams)

## *… I don’t think*, etc

In informal speech, expressions like *I don’t think* or *I don’t suppose* are often added after negative statements. In this case, the extra negative makes no difference to the meaning of the statement.

- *She hasn’t got much chance of passing the exam, **I don’t think**.*
- *We won’t be back before midnight, **I don’t suppose**.*

## Extra negative in expressions of doubt

In informal speech, a negative verb (without a negative meaning) is sometimes used after expressions of doubt or uncertainty.

- *I shouldn’t be surprised if they **didn’t** get married soon.* (= … if they got married soon.)
- *I wonder whether I **oughtn’t** to go and see a doctor – I’m feeling a bit funny.* (= … whether I ought to …)
