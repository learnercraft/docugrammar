# Negative structures: basic rules

## Negative verb forms: auxiliary + *not*

We make negative verb forms by putting *not* after an auxiliary verb.

- *We **have not** forgotten you.*
- *It **was not** raining.*
- *She **can’t** swim.*

*Do* is normally used if there is no other auxiliary verb.

- *I like the salad, but I **don’t** like the soup.* (not *~~I like not the soup.~~*)

*Do* is followed by the infinitive without *to*.

- *I didn’t **think**. (not *~~I didn’t to think.~~*) or *~~I didn’t thinking.~~* or *~~I didn’t thought.~~**

*Do* is not used with another auxiliary verb.

- *You **mustn’t** worry.* (not *~~You don’t must worry.~~*)

*Do* is not normally used with *be* (even when *be* is not auxiliary).

- *The supper **isn’t** ready.* (not *~~The supper doesn’t be ready.~~*)

:::note

For negative forms of *have*, *dare*, *need* and *used*, see the entries on these verbs.

For the dialect form *ain’t*, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-formation-and-spelling/contractions-i-ll-don-t-etc#list-of-contractions).

For negatives without *do* in older English (e.g. *I like him not*), [(see here)](./../varieties-of-english/changes-in-english#older-english-verb-forms-tell-me-what-thou-knowest).

For negative subjunctives (e.g. *It’s important that he not be disturbed*), [(see here)](./../conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/subjunctive-that-she-go-that-they-be-if-i-were-etc#that-she-see).

:::

## Imperatives: *Don’t worry.*

Negative imperatives are made with *do not / don’t* + infinitive [(see here)](./imperatives).

- ***Do not expect** quick results.* (not *~~Expect not …~~*)
- ***Don’t worry** – I’ll look after you.* (not *~~Worry not …~~*)

*Do not / don’t* is also used to make the negative imperative of *be*.

- ***Don’t be** rude.*

## Infinitives and *-ing* forms: *It’s important not to worry.*

We put *not* before infinitives and *\-ing* forms. *Do* is not used.

- *It’s important **not to worry**.* (not *~~… to don’t worry.~~*)
- *The best thing about the weekend is **not working**.*

## Other parts of a clause: *not his wife*, *not before six*

We can put *not* with other parts of a clause, not only a verb.

- *Ask Jake, **not his wife**.*
- *Come early, but **not before six**.*
- *It’s working, but **not well**.*

We do not usually begin a sentence with *not* + subject. Instead, we use a structure with *it* (‘cleft sentence’, [(see here)](./../information-structure/cleft-sentences-it-was-my-secretary-who).

- ***It** was **not George** that came, but his brother.* (not *~~Not George came …~~*)

:::note

For the difference between *not* and *no* with nouns, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/not-and-no).

:::

## Other negative words: *never*, *seldom*, etc

Other words besides *not* can make a clause negative. Compare:

- *He’s **not** at home.*
- *He’s **never** at home.*
- *He’s **seldom / rarely / hardly ever** at home.*

We do not normally use the auxiliary *do* with these other words. Compare:

- *He **doesn’t** **work**.*
- *He never **works**.* (not *~~He does never work.~~*)
- *He seldom / rarely / hardly ever **works**.*
- *They **refuse** to listen to reason.*
- *The soup **lacks** salt.*
- *We’re **unhappy** about your decision.*

However, *do* can be used for emphasis or contrast.

- *I never **did** like her.*

## Question tags: *You don’t …*, *do you?*

After negative clauses, question tags ( [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/question-tags-basic-information) are not negative.

- *You don’t work on Sundays, **do you?***
- *You seldom work on Saturdays, **do you?*** (not *~~You seldom work on Saturdays, don’t you?~~*)
- *She never smiled, **did she?***

The same thing happens after clauses with *little* and *few* [(see here)](./../determiners-quantifiers/a-little-and-a-few).

- *There’s **little** point in doing anything about it, **is there?*** (not *~~… isn’t there?~~*)
- *He has **few** reasons for staying, **has he?***

## ‘non-affirmative’ words: *any*, etc

We do not usually use *some*, *somebody*, etc in negative clauses. Instead, we use the ‘non-affirmative’ words *any*, *anybody*, etc [(see here)](./non-affirmative-words-anybody-ever-yet-etc). Compare:

- *I**’ve found some** mushrooms.*
- *I **haven’t found any** mushrooms.*
