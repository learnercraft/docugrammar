# Negative structures with think, hope, seem, etc

## *I don’t think …*

When we introduce negative ideas with *think*, *believe*, *suppose*, *imagine* and words with similar meanings, we usually make the first verb (*think*, etc) negative, not the second.

- *I **don’t think** you’ve met my wife.* (More natural than *I think you haven’t met my wife*.)

- *I **don’t believe** she’s at home.* (More natural than *I believe she isn’t at home*.)

However, surprise is often expressed with *I thought* + negative.

- *‘Would you like a drink?’ ‘I **thought** you’d **never** ask.’*
- *Hello! I **thought** you **weren’t** coming.*

## *I hope that … not …*

This does not happen with *hope*.

- *I **hope** it **doesn’t** rain.* (not *~~I don’t hope it rains.~~*)

## Short answers: *I suppose not*

In short answers, most of these verbs can be followed by *not* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/so-and-not-with-hope-believe-etc).

- *‘Are we going to see Luke again?’ ‘I **believe/suppose/hope not**.’*

Another possible short answer construction is *I don’t … so* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/so-and-not-with-hope-believe-etc).

- *‘Do you think it’ll snow?’ ‘I **don’t believe/suppose/think so**.’*

*Hope* is not used in this structure.

- *I **hope not**.* (not *~~I don’t hope so.~~*)

*I don’t think so* is more common than *I think not*, which is rather formal.

## Verbs followed by infinitives

Many verbs can be followed by infinitives [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/infinitives-after-verbs-it-s-beginning-to-rain). In an informal style we often prefer to make the first verb negative rather than the infinitive, although this may not change the meaning at all. This happens, for example, with *appear*, *seem*, *expect*, *happen*, *intend* and *want*.

- *Sibyl **doesn’t seem** to like you.* (Less formal than *Sibyl seems not to like you*.)
- *I **don’t expect** to see you before Monday.* (More natural than *I expect not to see you …*)
- *Angela and I were at the same university, but we **never happened** to meet.* (Less formal than *… we happened never to meet*.)
- *I **don’t want** to fail this exam.* (not *~~I want not to fail …~~*)
- ***I never want** to see you again.* (More natural than *I want never to see you again.*)
