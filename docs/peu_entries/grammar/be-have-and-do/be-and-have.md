# *be* and *have*

## Physical conditions: hunger, thirst, etc

To talk about experiencing hunger, thirst, heat, cold and certain other common physical conditions, we normally use ***be*** (or ***feel***) **+ adjective**, not ***have* + noun**. Note the following expressions:

- *be hungry* (not *have hunger*), *be thirsty*, *be warm*, *be hot*, *be cold*, *be sleepy*, *be afraid*

Note also:

- *be right*, *be wrong*, *be lucky*

## Age, height, weight, size and colour

*Be* is also used to talk about age, height, length, weight, size, shape and colour.

- *I’**m** nearly thirty.* (not *~~I have nearly thirty.~~*)
- *She **is** nearly my age.*
- *I wish I **was** ten kilos lighter.*
- *The room **is** ten metres long.*
- *He **is** six feet tall.*
- *What size **are** your shoes?*
- *What colour **are** his eyes?*
- *She **is** the same height as her father.*

*Be heavy* is not usually used in measuring expressions.

- *It **weighs** 37 kilos.* (not *~~It’s 37 kilos heavy.~~*)

:::note
For *have* in expressions like *have a bath*, *have a drink*, *have a walk*, [see here](./have-actions).
