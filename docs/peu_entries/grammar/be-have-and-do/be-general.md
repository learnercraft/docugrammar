# *be*: general

*Be* can be an **auxiliary verb**, used to form progressive and passive structures ( [(see here)](./../verbs/progressive-structures), [(see here)](./../passives/passive-structures-and-verb-forms).

- *What **are** you doing?*
- *We **weren’t** told about the meeting.*

As an auxiliary verb, *be* can have progressive forms in passive structures [(see here)](./../passives/passive-structures-and-verb-forms#use-of-tenses).

- *The hospital **is being** rebuilt.*
- *I knew we **were being** watched.*

*Be* can also be a **linking verb**, used to join a subject to a complement.

- *This **is** difficult.*
- *Andy **was** very tired.*

Progressive forms of the linking verb *be* are not usual.

- *It’s cold today.* (not *~~It’s being cold today.~~*)

But they are possible in some cases [(see here)](./be-progressive-forms).

- *You’**re being** stupid.*

Questions and negatives are formed without *do*, but *do* is used in negative and emphatic imperatives [(see here)](./be-with-auxiliary-do).

- ***Don’t be*** *afraid.*
- ***Do be*** *careful.* (stronger than *Be careful.*)

:::note
For the structure *there is*, used to introduce indefinite subjects, [(see here)](./there-is).

For ***be* + infinitive** (e.g. *She is to arrive tomorrow*), [(see here)](./../talking-about-the-future/be-to-infinitive-i-am-to-you-are-to-etc).

For contractions (e.g. *I’m*, *isn’t*), [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-formation-and-spelling/contractions-i-ll-don-t-etc).
