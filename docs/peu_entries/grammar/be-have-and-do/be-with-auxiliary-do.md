# *be* with auxiliary *do*

Normally, *be* is used without the auxiliary *do*.

- ***I’m not*** *often sick.* (not *~~I don’t often be sick.~~*)

But *do* is used to make negative imperative sentences with *be* (when we tell somebody not to do something).

- ***Don’t be*** *silly!*
- ***Don’t be** such a nuisance!*

And *do be* can begin emphatic imperatives.

- ***Do be*** *careful!*
- ***Do be*** *quiet, for God’s sake!*

In an informal style, people sometimes use *do* with *be* in one or two other structures which have a similar meaning to imperative sentences.

- *Why **don’t** you **be** a good boy and sit down?*
- *If you **don’t be** quiet you’ll go straight to bed.*
