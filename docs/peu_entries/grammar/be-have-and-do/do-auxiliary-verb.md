# *do*: auxiliary verb

The auxiliary verb *do* is followed by infinitives without *to*. It has several uses.

## Questions

We use *do* to make questions with ordinary verbs, but not with other auxiliary verbs [(see here)](./../basic-clause-types/questions-basic-rules). Compare:

- ****Do*** you like football?* (not *~~Like you football?~~*)
- *Can you play football?* (not *~~Do you can play football?~~*)

The auxiliary *do* can make questions with the ordinary verb *do*.

- *What ***do*** you ***do*** in the evenings?*

## Negatives

We use *do* to make negative clauses with ordinary verbs (including the ordinary verb *do*), but not with other auxiliary verbs [(see here)](./../basic-clause-types/negative-structures-basic-rules).

- *I ***don’t*** like football.* (not *~~I like not football.~~*)
- ***Don’t** go.*
- *I **don’t** **do** much in the evenings.*
- but *I can’t play football.* (not *~~I don’t can play football.~~*)

## Emphasis

We can use *do* in an affirmative clause for emphasis.

- ***Do** sit down.*
- *You **do** look nice today!*
- *She thinks I don’t love her, but I **do** love her.*
- *I don’t do much sport now, but I **did** play football when I was younger.*

## Inversion

*Do* is used in some structures with inversion (verb before subject) [(see here)](./../information-structure/inversion-auxiliary-verb-before-subject).

- *At no time **did** he lose his self-control.*

## Ellipsis

In cases where an auxiliary is used instead of a whole verb phrase [(see here)](./../information-structure/ellipsis-after-auxiliary-verbs), *do* is common in affirmative clauses as well as questions and negatives.

- *She doesn’t like dancing, but I **do**.* (= … but I like dancing.)
- *‘That meat smells funny.’ ‘Yes, it **does**, **doesn’t** it?’*
- *Anna thinks there’s something wrong with James, and so ***do*** I.*
