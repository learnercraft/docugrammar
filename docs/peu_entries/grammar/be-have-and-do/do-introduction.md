# *do*: introduction

*Do* has three main uses.

## Auxiliary verb

The auxiliary *do* is used to form the questions and negatives of other verbs, as well as emphatic and shortened forms. For details, [(see here)](./do-auxiliary-verb).

- ***Did*** *you remember to buy milk?*
- *This **doesn’t** taste very nice.*
- *I **do** like your earrings.*
- ‘*Jack eats too much.*’ ‘*He certainly **does**.*’

## General-purpose verb

*Do* is also an ordinary (non-auxiliary) verb. It can refer to almost any kind of activity, and is used when it is not necessary or not possible to be more precise. For details, and the difference between *do* and *make*, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/do-general-purpose-verb-do-and-make).

- *What are you **doing**?*
- *Don’t just stand there. **Do** something.*
- *I’ve finished the phone calls, and I’ll **do** the letters tomorrow.*

## Substitute verb

In British English, *do* can be used alone as a substitute for a main verb after an auxiliary. For details, [(see here)](./do-substitute-verb-i-may-do).

- ‘*Do you think Jake will come?*’ ‘*He might **do**.*’ (AmE *He might*.)

*Do so*/*it*/*that* can be used as a substitute expression when we want to avoid repeating another verb and what follows. For details, [(see here)](./do-so-it-that).

- *I need to take a rest, and I shall **do so** as soon as I can find time.*
- *He told me to open the door. I **did it** as quietly as I could.*

## Combined forms

Auxiliary *do* and non-auxiliary *do* can occur together.

- ***Do*** *you **do** much gardening?*
- *How **do** you **do**?*
- *The company **didn’t do** very well last year.*
