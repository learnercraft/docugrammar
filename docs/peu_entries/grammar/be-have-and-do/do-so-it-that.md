# *do so*/*it*/*that*

## *do so*

The expression *do so* can be used to avoid repeating a verb and its object or complement. It is usually rather formal.

- *‘Put the car away, please.’ ‘I’ve already **done so**.’*
- *Eventually she divorced Joshua. It was a pity she had not **done so** earlier.*
- *He told me to get out, and I **did so** as quietly as possible.*

## *do so* and *do it*/*that*

*Do it* and *do that* can be used instead of *do so*.

- *I promised to get the tickets, and I will **do so/it** as soon as possible.*
- *She rode a camel: she had never **done so/that** before.*

We use *do so* mainly to refer to the same action, with the same subject, that was mentioned before. In other cases we prefer *do it/that* or *do* alone.

- *I haven’t got time to get the tickets. Who’s going to **do it**?* (not *~~… Who’s going to do so?~~*)
- *‘I rode a camel in Morocco.’ ‘I’d love to **do that**.’* (not *~~… to do so.~~*)
- *I always eat peas with honey. My wife never **does**.* (not *~~… My wife never does so.~~*)

## *do so/it/that*: deliberate actions

*Do so/it/that* are mainly used to refer to deliberate dynamic actions. We do not usually use these expressions to replace verbs like *fall*, *lose*, *like*, *remember*, *think*, *own*, which refer to involuntary actions or states.

- *I like the saxophone, and I always **have (done)**.* (AmE ... *and I always **have**.*) (not *~~… and I have always done so/it/that.~~*)
- *She lost her money. I wasn’t surprised that she **did**.* (not *~~… that she did so/it/that.~~*)
- *I think Jake’s wrong. I **did** when he first spoke to me.* (not *~~… I did so/it/that when …~~*)

## Other verbs

Note that *so*, *it* and *that* are not normally used in this way after auxiliary verbs. It is not possible in standard English to say *I can so*, *She was it* or *I have that*.
