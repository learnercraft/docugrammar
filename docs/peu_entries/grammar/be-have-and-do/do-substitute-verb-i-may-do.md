# *do*: substitute verb (*I may do.*)

## auxiliary verb + do

In British English (but not American), *do* can be used alone as a substitute verb after an auxiliary verb.

- *‘Come and stay with us.’ ‘I may (**do**), if I have the time.’* (AmE *I may, if …* or *I may come, if …*)
- *‘He’s supposed to have locked the safe.’ ‘He has (**done**).’* (AmE *He has.* or *He has locked it.*)
- *He didn’t pass his exam, but he could have (**done**) if he’d tried harder.*
- *He smokes more than he used to (**do**).*

Progressive forms are possible, but not very common.

- *‘You should be getting dressed.’ ‘I **am (doing)**.’*

Note that the auxiliary verb is stressed in this structure.

- *‘Close the door.’ ‘I **``HAVE``** done.’* (not *~~… I have ``DONE``.~~*)
