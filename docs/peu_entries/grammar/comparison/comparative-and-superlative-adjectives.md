# Comparative and superlative adjectives

One-syllable adjectives normally have comparatives and superlatives ending in *\-er*, *\-est*. Some two-syllable adjectives are similar; others have *more* and *most*. Longer adjectives have *more* and *most*.

## One-syllable adjectives (regular comparison)

| Adjective | Comparative | Superlative | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *old* | *old**er*** | *old**est*** | |
| *tall* | *tall**er*** | *tall**est*** | Most adjectives: + ***-er***, ***-est*** |
| *cheap* | *cheap**er*** | *cheap**est*** | |
| | | | |
| *lat**e*** | *lat**er*** | *lat**est*** | Adjectives ending in *-e*: + ***-r***, ***-st*** |
| *nic**e*** | *nic**er*** | *nic**est*** | |
| | | | |
| *f**at*** | *fa**tt**er* | *fa**tt**est* | |
| *b**ig*** | *bi**gg**er* | *bi**gg**est* | One vowel + one consonant: double consonant.
| *th**in*** | *thi**nn**er* | *thi**nn**est* | |

Note the pronunciation of:

- *younger* /ˈjʌŋgə(r)/
- *youngest* /ˈjʌŋgɪst/ or /ˈjʌŋgəst/
- *longer* /ˈlɒŋgə(r)/
- *longest* /ˈlɒŋgɪst/ or /ˈlɒŋgəst/
- *stronger* /ˈstrɒŋgə(r)/
- *strongest* /ˈstrɒŋgɪst/ or /ˈstrɒŋgəst/

## Irregular comparison

| Adjective | Comparative | Superlative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *good* | *better* | *best* |
| *bad* | *worse* | *worst* |
| *ill* | *worse* |   |
| *far* | *farther/further* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/farther-and-further) | *farthest/furthest* |
| *old* | *older/elder* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/elder-and-eldest) | *oldest/eldest* |

The determiners *little* and *much*/*many* have irregular comparatives and superlatives:

- *little* [(see here)](./../determiners-quantifiers/a-little-and-a-few)
- *much/many* [(see here)](./../determiners-quantifiers/much-and-many)
- *less* [(see here)](./../determiners-quantifiers/less-and-fewer)
- *more* [(see here)](./../determiners-quantifiers/more)
- *least* [(see here)](./../determiners-quantifiers/least-and-fewest)
- *most* [(see here)](./../determiners-quantifiers/most)

*Few* has two possible comparatives and superlatives: *fewer/less* and *fewest/least*. [(see here)](./../determiners-quantifiers/less-and-fewer)

## Two-syllable adjectives

Adjectives ending in *\-y* have *\-ier* and *\-iest*.

| Adjective | Comparative | Superlative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *happ**y*** | *happ**ier*** | *happ**iest*** |
| *eas**y*** | *eas**ier*** | *eas**iest*** |

Some other two-syllable adjectives can have *\-er* and *\-est*, especially adjectives ending in an unstressed vowel, /l/ or /ə(r)/.

| Adjective | Comparative | Superlative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *narrow* | *narrow**er*** | *narrow**est*** |
| *simple* | *simple**r*** | *simple**st*** |
| *clever* | *clever**er*** | *clever**est*** |
| *quiet* | *quiet**er*** | *quiet**est*** |

With many two-syllable adjectives (e.g. *polite*, *common*), *\-er*/*\-est* and *more*/*most* are both possible. With others (including adjectives ending in *\-ing*, *\-ed*, *\-ful* and *\-less*), only *more*/*most* is possible. In general, the structure with *more*/*most* is becoming more common. To find out the normal comparative and superlative for a particular two-syllable adjective, check in a good dictionary.

## Longer adjectives

Adjectives of three or more syllables have *more* and *most*.

| Adjective | Comparative | Superlative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *intelligent* | ***more** intelligent* | ***most** intelligent* |
| *practical* | ***more** practical* | ***most** practical* |
| *beautiful* | ***more** beautiful* | ***most** beautiful* |

Words like *unhappy* (the opposites of two-syllable adjectives ending in *\-y*) are an exception: they can have forms in *\-er* and *\-est*.

| Adjective | Comparative | Superlative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *unhappy* | *unhapp**ier** / **more** unhappy* | *unhapp**iest** / **most** unhappy* |
| *untidy* | *untid**ier** / **more** untidy* | *untid**iest** / **most** untidy* |

Some compound adjectives like *good-looking* or *well-known* have two possible comparatives and superlatives.

| Adjective | Comparative | Superlative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *good-looking* | ***better**\-looking* or ****more good***\-looking* | ***best**\-looking* or ****most good***\-looking* |
| *well-known* | ***better**\-known* or ****more well***\-known* | ***best**\-known* or ****most well***\-known* |

## *more*, *most* with short adjectives

Sometimes *more*/*most* are used with adjectives that normally have *\-er*/*\-est*. This can happen, for example, when a comparative is not followed immediately by *than*; forms with *\-er* are also possible.

- *The road’s getting **more and more steep**.* (or *… **steeper** and **steeper**.*)

When we compare two descriptions (saying that one is more suitable or accurate than another), we use *more*; comparatives with *\-er* are not possible.

- *He’s **more lazy** than stupid.* (not *~~He’s lazier than stupid.~~*)

In a rather formal style, *most* can be used with adjectives expressing approval and disapproval (including one-syllable adjectives) to mean ‘very’.

- *Thank you very much indeed. That is **most kind** of you.* (not *~~… That is kindest of you.~~*)
- *You are **most** welcome.*

*Real*, *right*, *wrong* and *like* always have *more* and *most*.

- *She’s **more like** her mother than her father.* (not *~~… liker her mother …~~*)
