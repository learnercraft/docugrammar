# Comparison: advanced points

## Comparative meaning ‘relatively’, ‘more than average’

Comparatives can suggest ideas like ‘relatively’, ‘more than average’. Used like this, comparatives make a less clear and narrow selection than superlatives. Compare:

- *There are two classes – one for the **cleverer** students and one for the **slower** learners.*
- *The **cleverest** students were two girls from York.*

Comparatives are often used in advertising to make things sound less definite.

- ***less expensive** clothes for the **fuller** figure* (Compare *cheap clothes for fat people*.)

## *all/any/none the* + comparative

*All the* + comparative (more common in British English) suggests the idea of ‘even more …’.

- *I feel **all the better** for that swim.*
- *Her accident made it **all the more important** to get home fast.*

*Any* and *none* can be used in similar structures.

- *He didn’t seem to be **any the worse** for his experience.*
- *He explained it all carefully, but I was still **none the wiser**.*

Note that this structure is used mainly to express abstract ideas. We would not say, for example, *Those pills have made him all the slimmer.*

In this structure, *the* was originally a demonstrative, meaning ‘by that’.

## *three times …er*, etc

Instead of *three/four*, etc *times as much* [(see here)](./as-as-as-much-many-as#half-as-as-etc), we can use *three/four*, etc *times* + comparative.

- *She can walk **three times faster** than you.*
- *It was **ten times more difficult** than I expected.*

Note that *twice* and *half* are not possible in this structure.

- *She’s **twice as lively** as her sister.* (not *~~… twice livelier …~~*)

## Words left out after *than*

*Than* often replaces a subject or object pronoun or an adverbial expression, rather like a relative pronoun or adverb [(see here)](./../other-adverbial-clauses/than-and-as-clauses-leaving-out-subjects-etc).

- *She spent more money **than was** sensible.* (not *~~… than it was sensible.~~*)
- *There were more people **than** we had **expected**.* (not *~~… than we had expected them.~~*)
- *I love you more **than she** does.* (not *~~… than how much she does.~~*)

(In some English dialects, the above sentences would be constructed with *than what*.)

## *the youngest person to* …

After a superlative, an infinitive can mean the same as a relative clause.

- *She’s the **youngest** person ever **to swim** the Channel.* (= … the youngest person who has ever swum …)

This structure is also common after *first*, *last* and *next*.

- *Who was the **first** woman **to climb** Everest?*
- *The **next to speak** was Mrs Fenshaw.*

Note that this structure is only possible in cases where the noun with the superlative (or *first*, etc) has a subject relationship with the following verb. In other cases, infinitives cannot be used.

- *Is this the first time that you have stayed here?* (not *~~… the first time for you to stay here~~* – *time* is not the subject of *stay*.)

## Superlatives with or without *the*

Nouns with superlative adjectives normally have the article *the*.

- *It’s **the best book** I’ve ever read.*

After linking verbs, superlative adjectives also usually have *the*, though it is sometimes dropped in an informal style.

- *I’m **the greatest**.*
- *Which of the boys is **(the) strongest?***
- *This dictionary is **(the) best**.*

*The* cannot be dropped when a superlative is used with a defining expression.

- *This dictionary is **the best I could find**.* (not *~~This dictionary is best I could find.~~*)

However, we do not use *the* with superlatives when we compare the same person or thing in different situations. Compare:

- *Of all my friends, he’s **(the) nicest**.* (comparing different people)  
  *He’s **nicest** when he’s with children.* (not *~~He’s the nicest when …~~* – we’re comparing the same person in different situations.)

- *She works **(the) hardest** in the family; her husband doesn’t know what work is.* (A woman is being compared with a man – *the* is possible.)  
  *She works **hardest** when she’s doing something for her family.* (not *~~She works the hardest when …~~* – a woman’s work is being compared in different situations.)

*The* is sometimes dropped before superlative adverbs in an informal style.

- *Who can run **(the) fastest**?*
