# Introduction

Various words and structures can be used for comparing. This Section deals particularly with structures used for expressing **equality** and **inequality**.

## Equality: *as … as*

To say that people, things, etc are equal in a particular way, we often use the structure *as (much*/*many) … as* [(see here)](./as-as-as-much-many-as).

- *My hands were **as** cold **as** ice.*
- *I earn **as much** money **as** you.*

## Inequality: *older than*, *more attractive than*, *laziest*, *most annoying*, etc

To say that people, things, etc are unequal in a particular way, we can use comparative adjectives and adverbs, or *more* + adjective/adverb ( [(see here)](./comparative-and-superlative-adjectives).

- *He’s much **older** than her.*
- *The baby’s **more attractive** than you.*

To say which one of a group is outstanding in a particular way, we can use a superlative or *most* + adjective/adverb ( [(see here)](./comparative-and-superlative-adjectives).

- *You’re the **laziest** and **most annoying** person in the whole office.*

## Inequality: *less*, *least*; *not so*/*as … as*

We can also talk about inequality by looking at the ‘lower’ end of the scale. One possibility is to use *less (than)* [(see here)](./../determiners-quantifiers/less-and-fewer) or *least* [(see here)](./../determiners-quantifiers/least-and-fewest).

- *The baby’s **less** ugly than you.*
- *I want to spend the **least** possible time working.*

In informal usage, we more often use *not so … as* or *not as … as* [(see here)](./as-as-as-much-many-as).

- *The baby’s **not so** ugly **as** you.*

## Similarity and identity: *as*, *like*, *so do I*, *too*, *the same*, etc

If we want to say that people, things, actions or events are similar, we can use *as* or *like* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/like-and-as-similarity-function); *so*/*neither do I* and similar structures [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/so-am-i-neither-do-they-etc); or adverbs such as *too*, *also* and *as well* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/also-as-well-and-too). To say that they are identical, we can use *the same (as)* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/the-same).

- *He liked working with horses, **as** his father did.*
- *Your sister looks just **like** you.*
- *She likes music, and **so do I**.*
- *The fish was over-cooked and the vegetables were **too**.*
- *His eyes are just **the same** colour **as** mine.*
