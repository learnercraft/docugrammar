# *much older*, *by far the oldest*, etc

## *much*, *far*, etc with comparatives

We cannot use *very* with comparatives. Instead, we use, for example, *much*, *far*, *very much*, *a lot (informal)*, *lots (informal)*, *any* and *no* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/any-and-no-adverbs), *rather*, *a little*, *a bit (informal)*, and *even*.

- *My boyfriend is **much**/**far older** than me.* (not *~~… very older than me.~~*)
- *Russian is **much**/**far more difficult** than Spanish.*
- ***very much** nicer*
- ***a bit** more sensible* (informal)
- ***a lot** happier* (informal)
- *Is your mother **any better**?*
- ***rather** more quickly*
- *She looks **no older** than her daughter.*
- ***a little** less expensive*
- *Your cooking is **even worse** than Harry’s.*

*Quite* cannot be used with comparatives except in the expression *quite better*, meaning ‘recovered from an illness’ [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/better#recovered). *Any*, *no*, *a bit* and *a lot* are not normally used to modify comparatives before nouns.

- *There are **much**/**far nicer shops** in the town centre.* (but not *~~… a bit nicer shops …~~*)

## *many more*/*less*/*fewer*

When *more* [(see here)](./../determiners-quantifiers/more) begins a plural noun phrase, it is modified by *many* instead of *much*. Compare:

- *much / far / a lot, etc more money*
- ***many** / far / a lot, etc **more opportunities***

*Much* and *many* are not used to modify *less* or *fewer*, in plural noun phrases.

- ***far fewer** words* (*~~much/many fewer words~~*)

## *much*, *by far*, *quite*, etc with superlative noun phrases

Superlative noun phrases can be modified by *much* and *by far*, and by other adverbs of degree such as *quite* (meaning ‘absolutely’), *almost*, *practically*, *nearly* and *easily*. *Much* and *quite* are used in this way mostly in British English.

- *He’s **much the most imaginative** of them all.* (BrE)
- *She’s **by far the oldest**.*
- *We’re walking **by far the slowest**.*
- *He’s **quite the most stupid** man I’ve ever met.* (BrE)
- *I’m **nearly the oldest** in the company.*
- *This is **easily the worst** party I’ve been to this year.*

## *very* with superlatives

Note the special use of *very* to emphasise superlatives and *first*, *next* and *last*.

- *Bring out your **very best** wine – Michael’s coming to dinner.*
- *You’re the **very first** person I’ve spoken to today.*
- *This is your **very last** chance.*
