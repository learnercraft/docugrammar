# *not … or*; *not … nor*; and *not*

## *not* used once for two negative ideas

When *not* (used once) refers to two or more verbs, nouns, adjectives, etc, we usually join them with *or*.

- *He doesn’t **smoke or drink**.* (not *~~He doesn’t smoke nor drink.~~*)

- *She wasn’t **angry or upset**.*
- *It’s not **on the table or in the cupboard**.*

However, we can use *nor* after a pause, to separate and emphasise a second verb, adjective, etc.

- *Our main need is not food, **nor** money. It is education.*
- *She didn’t phone that day, **nor** the next day.*

Note that *neither* cannot be used in this way.

*And* cannot normally be used in this kind of structure.

- *The project was not successful in economic terms **or** in political terms.* (not *~~The project was not successful in political terms and in economic terms.~~*)

This also happens after negative nouns or adjectives.

- *The country suffered from a **lack** of employment legislation **or** of an independent labour union.* (More normal than *a lack of … and …*)

:::note

For the use of *neither … nor* to join two negative ideas (e.g. *He neither smokes nor drinks*), [(see here)](./emphatic-coordination-both-and-n-either-n-or-not-only#neither--nor).

:::

## Two separate negative clauses: *not either*

After using a negative verb in one clause, we can mention a second negative idea or fact in another clause with *not … either.*

- *Daniel **isn’t** here today. Jack **isn’t** here **either**.* (not *~~Jack isn’t here neither.~~*)

Another way of expressing this is with ***neither/nor*** + *be*/auxiliary + subject.

- *Daniel isn’t here today. **Neither is** Jack.*
- *I can’t sing, and **nor can** any of my family.*

For details of this and similar structures, [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/so-am-i-neither-do-they-etc#neither-do-i-i-cant-either-etc).

*Also*, *as well* and *too* are not normally used with *not* in this way.

- *You **can’t** have an apple, and you **can’t** have an orange **either**.* (not *~~… and you can’t have an orange also / as well / too.~~*)

## Positive + negative: *also / as well / too*

After mentioning a positive (non-negative) fact or idea, we can add a negative point by using *not … also*, *not … as well* or *not … too*.

- *You **can** have an apple, but you **can’t** have an orange **too**.*
- *He **drinks** too much, but at least he **doesn’t smoke as well**.*
