# Subjunctive: *that she go, that they be, if I were*, etc

## What is the subjunctive?

Some languages have special verb forms called ‘subjunctive’, which are used especially in subordinate clauses to talk about ‘unreal’ situations: things which are possible, desirable or imaginary. Older English had subjunctives, but in modern English they have mostly been replaced by uses of *should*, *would* and other modal verbs, by special uses of past tenses [(see here)](./../past-and-perfect-tenses/past-verb-form-with-present-or-future-meaning), and by ordinary verb forms. English only has a few subjunctive forms left: third person singular present verbs without *\-(e)s*, (e.g. *she see*, *he have*) and special forms of *be* (e.g. *I be*, *he were*). Except for *I*/*he*/*she*/*it* *were* after *if*, they are not very common.

## *that she see*

Ordinary verbs only have one subjunctive form: a third person singular present with no *\-(e)s* (e.g. *she see*). It is sometimes used in *that*\-clauses in a formal style, especially in American English, after words which express the idea that something is important or desirable (e.g. *suggest*, *recommend*, *ask*, *insist*, *vital*, *essential*, *important*, *advice*). The same forms are used in both present and past sentences.

- *It is essential that every child **have** the same educational opportunities.*
- *It was important that James **contact** Adam as soon as possible.*
- *Our advice is that the company **invest** in new equipment.*
- *The judge recommended that Simmons **remain** in prison for life.*

*Do* is not used in negative subjunctives. Note the word order.

- *We felt it desirable that he **not leave** school before eighteen.*

With verbs that are not third person singular, the forms are the same as ordinary present-tense verbs (but they may refer to the past).

- *I recommended that you **move** to another office.*

## *be*

*Be* has special subjunctive forms: *I be*, *you be*, etc.

- *It is important that Ella **be** present when we sign the papers.*
- *The Director asked that he **be** allowed to advertise for more staff.*

*I were* and *he*/*she*/*it were*, used for example after *if* [(see here)](./../if/special-structures-with-past-tenses-and-would#if-i-were-etc) and *wish* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/wish) in a formal style, are also subjunctives.

- *If I **were** you I should stop smoking.*
- *I wish it **were** Saturday.*

## Fixed phrases: *as it were*; *so be it*

Subjunctives are also used in certain fixed phrases. Examples:

- *God **save** the Queen!*
- *God **bless** you.*
- *Long **live** the King!*
- *Heaven **forbid**.*
- *He’s a sort of adopted uncle, as it **were**.* (= … in a way.)
- ***Be** that as it may …* (= Whether that is true or not …)
- *If we have to pay £2,000, then so **be** it.* (= We can’t do anything to change it.)

## Other structures

Most subjunctive structures are formal and unusual in British English. In *that*\-clauses, British people usually prefer *should* + infinitive [(see here)](./../noun-clauses-direct-and-indirect-speech/that-clauses#should-in-that-clauses-it-s-surprising-that-should), or ordinary present and past tenses.

- *It is essential that every child **should have** the same educational opportunities.* (or *… that every child has …*)
- *It was important that James **should contact** Adam as soon as possible.* (or *… that James contacted …*)
