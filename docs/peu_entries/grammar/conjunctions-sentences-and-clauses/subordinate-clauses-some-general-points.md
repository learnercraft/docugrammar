# Subordinate clauses: some general points

In most languages of European origin, clauses are joined together by conjunctions in similar ways. However, students who speak other languages may have some problems in using English conjunctions correctly.

## Position of subordinate clauses

Adverbial clauses can usually go either first or last in a sentence, depending on the focus. Putting a clause at the end can give it more importance.

- ***While I was taking a shower**, I slipped.* (emphasises what happened)  
  *I slipped **while I was taking a shower**.* (emphasises when it happened)
- ***If you need help**, just let me know.*  
  *Just let me know **if you need help**.*
- ***Although the bicycle was expensive**, she decided to buy it.*  
  *She decided to buy the bicycle **although it was expensive**.*
- ***Because she was too angry to speak**, Anna said nothing.*  
  *Anna said nothing, **because she was too angry to speak**.*

For the position of other kinds of clause, [*if* section](../if/if-introduction), [*Other adverbial clause*](../other-adverbial-clauses/other-adverbial-clauses-introduction), [*Noun clauses, direct and indirect speech*](../noun-clauses-direct-and-indirect-speech/noun-clauses-direct-and-indirect-speech-introduction), [*Information structure*](../information-structure/information-structure-introduction).

## Punctuation

Commas are often used to separate longer or more complicated clauses. Shorter pairs of clauses are often connected without commas. Compare:

- *They changed all their policies after they had won the election.*
- *They made a large number of disturbing changes in their policies, after they had won the election and settled in with a comfortable majority.*

When a subordinate clause begins a sentence, it is more often separated by a comma unless the sentence is very short.

- *When we opened the door, we saw water running down the stairs.*
- *When we opened the door(,) we got a shock.*

## Leaving words out

Words for repeated ideas can often be left out in the second of two co-ordinate clauses [(see here)](./../information-structure/ellipsis-with-and-but-and-or) for details), but not normally in a subordinate clause. Compare:

- *She was depressed **and didn’t** know what to do.* (= and she didn’t know what to do.)
- *She was depressed, **because she didn’t** know what to do.* (not *~~She was depressed, because didn’t know …~~*)

However, after *if*, *when*, *while*, *until*, *once*, *unless* and *(al)though*, a pronoun subject and the verb *be* can often be dropped, especially in common fixed expressions like *if necessary*.

- *I’ll pay for you **if necessary**.* (= … if it is necessary.)
- ***If in doubt**, wait and see.* (= If you are in doubt …)
- ***When in Rome**, do as the Romans do.*
- *Cook slowly **until ready**.*
- ***Once in bed**, I read for twenty minutes and then turned out the light.*

Many conjunctions that express time relations (*after*, *before*, *since*, *when*, *while*, *whenever*, *once* and *until*) can often be followed by *\-ing* forms or past participles instead of subjects and full verbs [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-other-uses/participle-clauses#participle-clauses-after-conjunctions-and-prepositions).

- *I always feel better **after talking** to you.*
- *Some things are never forgotten, **once learnt**.*

## Conjunctions in separate sentences

Normally a conjunction connects two clauses into one sentence. However, sometimes a conjunction and its clause can stand alone. This happens, for example, in answers.

- *‘When are you going to get up?’ ‘**When I’m ready.**’*
- *‘Why did you do that?’ ‘**Because I felt like it.**’*

Writers and speakers can also separate clauses for emphasis.

- *This government has got to go. **Before it does any more damage.***

Schoolchildren are sometimes told that it is wrong to write a one-clause sentence beginning with a conjunction in this way. In fact, the structure is perfectly correct when used appropriately.

Afterthoughts may also begin with conjunctions.

- *OK, I did it. – **But I didn’t mean to.***

## One conjunction for two clauses

One conjunction is enough to join two clauses – we do not normally use two.

- ***Although** she was tired, she went to work.*  
  *She was tired **but** she went to work.*  
  (not *~~Although she was tired but she went to work.~~*)
- ***Because** I liked him, I tried to help him.*  
  *I liked him, **so** I tried to help him.*  
  (not *~~Because I liked him, so I tried to help him.~~*)
- ***As** you know, I work very hard.*  
  *You know **that** I work very hard.*  
  (not *~~As you know, that I work very hard.~~*)

However, we can use *and* or *or* together with a repeated conjunction.

- *We came back because we ran out of money, **and because** Anna got ill.*
- *She didn’t write when I was ill, **or when** I got married.*

## Relative pronouns

Relative pronouns (*who*, *which* and *that*, [(see here)](./../relative-clauses/relatives-basic-information) also join clauses.

- *There’s the girl **who** works with my sister.*

A relative pronoun is the subject or object of the verb that comes after it. So we do not need another subject or object.

- *I’ve got a friend **who** works in a pub.* (not *~~… who he works in a pub.~~*)
- *The man **(that)** she married was an old friend of mine.* (not *~~The man that she married him …~~*)
- *She always thanks me for the money **that** I give her.* (not *~~… the money that I give her it.~~*)
