# *who, which, what*, etc after prepositions

Interrogative conjunctions like *who*, *which*, *what*, *where*, *whether* can follow prepositions.

- *We discussed the question **of who** to appoint as manager.*
- *I may be able to come: it depends **on which** day you are holding the meeting.*
- *They were not at all interested **in what** I thought.*

After common words like *tell*, *ask*, *idea*, prepositions are often dropped before these conjunctions.

- ***Tell** me **about** your trip.* ``but`` ***Tell** me **where** you went.*
- *Do you have any **idea of** the cost?* ``but`` *Do you have any **idea what** it costs?*

Prepositions are not normally used before other conjunctions such as *that*. Either they are dropped:

- *I **knew about** his problems.* ``but`` ***I knew that** he had problems.* (not *~~I knew about that he had problems.~~*)

or the expression *the fact* is put between the preposition and *that*.

- *I was not responsible for **the fact that** the documents were stolen.* (not *~~I was not responsible for that the documents were stolen.~~*)
