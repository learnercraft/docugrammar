# Articles: basic information (B)

(This entry is for students who speak languages (e.g. Russian or Japanese) that do not have articles like English *a*/*an* and *the*. Students who speak languages which have articles (e.g. German or Portuguese) should read entry [(see here)](./articles-basic-information-a).)

## Two basic rules

- To say ‘You know which I mean’, we put *the* before a noun.

  - *I’ve been to **the doctor**.* (You know which one: my doctor.)
  - *Have you fed **the dogs**?* (You know which ones I mean.)
  - *Could you pass **the salt**?* (You can see the salt that I want.)
- When we can’t say ‘You know which I mean’, we:
  - put *a/an* before a singular countable noun [(see here)](./more-about-a-an).
    - *There’s **a rat** in the kitchen!*
    - *I need **an envelope**.*
  - put no article with a plural or uncountable noun.
    - *She’s afraid of **rats**.*
    - *I need **help**.*

## Four common mistakes to avoid

- Don’t use *a*/*an* with plural or uncountable nouns.

  - *Jack collects **stamps**.* (not *~~… a stamps.~~*)
  - *Our garden needs **water**.* (not *~~… a water.~~*)
- Don’t use *the* to talk about things in general. *The* does not mean ‘all’. (For exceptions, [(see here)](./talking-in-general#generalisations-with-singular-countable-nouns).)

  - ***Elephants** can swim very well.* (not *~~The elephants can swim …~~*)
  - ***Gas** is expensive.* (not *~~The gas …~~*)
- Don’t use articles together with *my*, *this*, or other determiners.

  - ***my work*** (not *~~the my work~~*)
  - ***a friend** of mine* (not *~~a my friend~~*)
  - ***this problem*** (not *~~the this problem~~*)
- Don’t use singular countable nouns alone, without an article or other determiner. We can say *a cat*, *the cat*, *my cat*, *this cat*, *any cat*, *either cat* or *every cat*, but not just *cat*. (For exceptions, [(see here)](./special-rules-and-exceptions).)

  - *Give it to **the cat**.* (not *~~Give it to cat.~~*)
  - *Annie is **a doctor**.* (not *~~Annie is doctor.~~*)
