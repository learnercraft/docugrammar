# Introduction

## What are determiners?

**Determiners** are words that come at the beginning of noun phrases, before any adjectives. They mostly show **which** or **how much/many** we are talking about.

- ***the** manager*
- ***this** house*
- ***every** week*
- ***a** nice day*
- ***some** problems*
- ***enough** oil*
- ***my** fat old cat*
- ***either** arm*
- ***several** young students*

They fall into two main groups from a grammatical point of view.

1. **Articles** (*a/an* and *the*), **possessives** (*my*, *your*, etc) and **demonstratives** (*this*, *that*, etc).  
    These help to show which members or which part of a class or category we are talking about. Possessives and demonstratives are called ‘adjectives’ in older grammars and dictionaries, but they are quite different from adjectives.

2. **Quantifiers** (e.g. *all*, *some*, *each*, *much*, *most*, *several*) and one or two others.  
    These mostly show how much or how many we are talking about.  
    The first group are covered in this Section, and the others in [*Determiners: quantifiers*](../determiners-quantifiers/determiners-quantifiers-introduction).

## Articles

Article use is one of the most difficult points in English grammar, particularly for learners whose languages do not have article systems. Articles are difficult for several reasons:

- The two articles (and the use of **no article** or ‘zero article’) express several different meanings, and it is not always possible to draw clear lines between them.
- These meanings are relatively abstract and not easy to explain.
- Languages which have articles (e.g. French, Swedish, Portuguese) do not always use them in the same way as their English equivalents, especially when talking about things in general [(see here)](./talking-in-general).
- Sometimes article use is more a matter of vocabulary than grammar: we happen to use *the* in one expression, and *a* or no article in another similar expression, for no very good reason.
  - *on ***the radio****
  - *on ***TV****
  - *I’ve got **backache**.* (BrE)
  - *I’ve got **a headache**.*
  - *We took **a wrong turning** and went to **the wrong address**.*

However, much article use is regular; and the explanations in the following entries should help a good deal. Also, article mistakes do not usually matter very much for practical purposes: they rarely cause misunderstandings.

## Possessives: terminology

There are problems of terminology with possessives. *My*, *your*, etc [(see here)](./possessive-determiners-my-your-etc) are sometimes called ‘**possessive adjectives’**, while *mine*, *yours*, etc [(see here)](./../pronouns/possessive-pronouns-mine-yours-etc) are generally called ‘**possessive pronouns’**. In fact, both types of possessive are pronouns, because they stand for noun phrases. *My* replaces the noun phrase *the speaker’s*; *mine* replaces the more complex noun phrase *the speaker’s possession*. The real difference is that *my*, etc function as determiners in noun phrases while *mine*, etc are free-standing, used instead of noun phrases. None of this matters much from a practical point of view: the important thing is to use possessives correctly, not to worry about what they are called.
