# Possessive determiners: *my*, *your*, etc

## What kind of words are they?

*My*, *your*, *his*, *her*, *its*, *our* and *their* are **pronouns**, because they stand for possessive noun phrases: ***my** younger brother* means ‘**the speaker’s** younger brother’; ***their** plans* means for example ‘**those people’s** plans’ or ‘**the children’s** plans’.

They are used at the beginning of noun phrases, and function as **determiners**.

They are not adjectives, though they are sometimes called ‘possessive adjectives’ in older grammars and dictionaries.

Like all ‘possessive’ words and structures, they can express various ideas besides possession.

Note that *mine*, *yours*, etc [(see here)](./../pronouns/possessive-pronouns-mine-yours-etc) are also pronouns (of a different kind), but they are not used as determiners.

## *one’s* and *whose*

*One’s* [(see here)](./../pronouns/one-you-and-they-used-for-people-in-general#one-you-as-subject-object-etc) and *whose* ( [(see here)](./../relative-clauses/whose), [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/whose-question-word) are also possessive determiners/pronouns.

- *It’s easy to lose **one’s** temper when one is criticised.*
- *An orphan is a child **whose** parents are dead.*
- ***Whose** bicycle is that?*

## Not used with other determiners

*My*, *your*, etc are not used with other determiners like *the*, *a/an* or *this*.

- *She’s lost **her** keys.* (not *~~… the her keys.~~*)

If we want to use *a/an* or *this*, *that*, etc with a possessive, we use the ‘*… of mine*’ structure [(see here)](./../pronouns/a-friend-of-mine-etc).

- ***A friend of mine** has just invited me to Italy.* (not *~~A my friend …~~*)
- *How’s **that brother of yours**?* (not *~~… that your brother?~~*)

## Distributive use: *She told them to open their books*, etc

After a plural possessive, we do not normally use a singular noun in the sense of ‘one each’. (For details, [(see here)](./../nouns-and-noun-phrases-agreement/distributive-plural-tell-them-to-bring-raincoats).)

- *The teacher told the children to open **their books**.* (not *~~… their book.~~*)

## Articles instead of possessives: *a pain in the head*

We sometimes use articles instead of *my*, *your*, etc. This happens in common prepositional phrases which refer to the subject or object, mostly when we are talking about blows, pains and other things that often happen to parts of people’s bodies.

- *The ball hit him **on the head**.*
- *She’s got a pain **in the stomach**.*

In other cases we do not normally use articles instead of possessives [(see here)](./special-rules-and-exceptions#parts-of-the-body-etc).

- *She’s got a parrot **on her shoulder**.* (not *~~She’s got a parrot on the shoulder.~~*)
- *Mia broke **her leg** playing football.* (not *~~Mia broke the leg …~~*)
- *He stood there, **his eyes** closed and **his hands** in **his pockets**, looking half asleep.* (not *~~… the eyes closed and the hands in the pockets …~~*)

## Spelling: *its*, *whose*

The possessives *its* and *whose* have no apostrophes. *It’s* and *who’s* are not possessives, but contractions [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-formation-and-spelling/contractions-i-ll-don-t-etc): they mean ‘it is’ or ‘it has’; ‘who is’ or ‘who has’. Compare:

- *The dog’s in a good mood. **It’s** just had **its** breakfast.*
- *‘**Whose** little girl is that?’ ‘You mean the one **who’s** making all that noise?’*
