# Special rules and exceptions

## Common expressions without articles: *in bed;* *at school*

In some common fixed expressions to do with place, time and movement, normally countable nouns are treated as uncountables, without articles. Examples are:

- *to/at/in/from school/university/college*
- *to/at/in/into/from church*
- *to/in/into/out of bed/prison*
- *to/in/into/out of hospital* (BrE)
- *to/at/from work*
- *to/at sea*
- *to/in/from town*
- *at/from home*
- *leave home*
- *leave/start/enter school/university/college*
- *by day*
- *at night*
- *by car/bus/bicycle/plane/train/tube/boat*
- *on foot*
- *by radio/phone/letter/mail/email/text*

With place nouns, expressions with or without articles may have different meanings. Compare:

- *I met her **at college**.* (when we were students)  
  *I’ll meet you **at the college**.* (The college is just a meeting place.)
- *Megan’s **in hospital**.* (as a patient)  
  *I left my coat **in the hospital** when I was visiting Megan.*

In American English, *university* and *hospital* are not used without articles.

- *She was unhappy **at the university**.*
- *Say that again and I’ll put you **in the hospital**.*

## Double expressions: *with knife and fork*

Articles are often dropped in double expressions, particularly with prepositions.

- *with knife and fork*
- *with hat and coat*
- *from top to bottom*
- *on land and sea*
- *arm in arm*
- *inch by inch*
- *day after day*
- *husband and wife*

:::note

For cases like *the bread and (the) butter*, [(see here)](./../information-structure/ellipsis-with-and-but-and-or).

:::

## Possessive *’s*

Nouns lose their articles after possessive *’s*.

- ***the coat** that belongs to Jack* = *Jack’s **coat*** (not *~~Jack’s the coat~~*) or *~~the Jack’s coat~~*
- ***the economic problems** of America* = *America’s **economic problems*** (not *~~the America’s economic problems~~*)

But the possessive noun itself may have an article.

- *the wife of **the boss*** = ***the boss’s** wife*

## Noun modifiers

When a noun modifies another noun, the first noun’s article is dropped.

- *lessons in how to play **the guitar*** = ***guitar** lessons*
- *a spot on **the sun*** = *a **sun**spot*

## *both* and *all*

We often leave out *the* after *both*.

- ***Both* (the)* children are good at languages.*

And we generally leave out *the* between *all* and a number.

- ***All (the) three** brothers were arrested.*

We usually leave out *the* after *all* in *all day*, *all night*, *all week*, *all year*, *all winter* and *all summer*.

- *He’s been away **all week**.*
- *I haven’t seen her **all day**.*

## *kind of*, etc

We usually leave out *a*/*an* after *kind of*, *sort of*, *type of* and similar expressions [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/sort-of-kind-of-and-type-of).

- *What **kind of (a) person** is she?*
- *Have you got a cheaper **sort of radio**?*
- *They’ve developed a new **variety of sheep**.*

## *amount* and *number*

*The* is dropped after *the amount/number of*.

- *I was surprised at **the amount of money** collected.* (not *~~… of the money~~*)
- *The **number of unemployed** is rising steadily.*

## *man* and *woman*

Unlike other singular countable nouns, *man* and *woman* can be used in a general sense without articles.

- ***Man** and **woman** were created equal.*

But we more often use *a woman* and *a man*, or *men* and *women*.

- ***A woman** without **a man** is like a fish without a bicycle.* (old feminist joke)
- ***Men** and **women** have similar abilities and needs.*

*Man* is also commonly used to mean ‘the human race’, though many people regard this usage as sexist and prefer to avoid it [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/vocabulary-areas/gender-references-to-males-and-females#man).

- *How did **man** first discover fire?*

## Days, months and seasons

We drop *the* when we mean ‘the day/month before or after this one’.

- *Where were you **last Saturday**?*
- *I was away in **April**.*
- *See you on **Thursday**.*
- *We’re moving **next September**.*

To talk about the seasons in general, we can say *spring* or *the spring*, *summer* or *the summer*, etc. There is little difference.

- *Rome is lovely in **(the) spring**.*
- *I like **(the) winter** best.*

When we are talking about particular springs, summers, etc, we are more likely to use *the*.

- *I worked very hard in **the summer** that year.*

## Musical instruments

We often use *the* + singular when we talk about musical instruments in general, or about playing musical instruments.

- ***The violin** is really difficult.*
- *Who’s that on **the piano**?*

But *the* is often dropped when talking about jazz or pop, and sometimes when talking about classical music.

- *This recording was made with Miles Davis **on trumpet**.*
- *She studied **oboe** and **saxophone** at the Royal Academy of Music.*

## *(the) radio*, *(the) cinema*, *(the) theatre* and *television*

When we talk about our use of these forms of entertainment, we generally say *the radio*, ***the cinema*** (BrE), *the theatre*, but *television* or *TV*.

- *I always listen to **the radio** while I’m driving.*
- *It was a great treat to go to **the cinema** or **the theatre** when I was a child.* (BrE)
- *What’s on **TV**?*

*The* is often dropped in all four cases when we talk about these institutions as art forms or professions.

- ***Cinema** is different from **theatre** in several ways.*
- *He’s worked in **radio** and **television** all his life.*

## Jobs and positions: *He was elected President.*

*The* is not used in titles like *Queen Elizabeth*, *President Obama*. Compare:

- ***Queen** Elizabeth had dinner with **President Obama**.*
- ***The Queen** had dinner with **the President**.*

And *the* is not usually used in the complement of a sentence, when we say that somebody has or gains a unique position (the only one in the organisation). Compare:

- *They appointed him **Head Librarian**.*
- *He was elected **President** in 1879.*
- *Where’s **the librarian**?*
- *I want to see **the president**.*

## Addressing people: *Good morning, children.*

We don’t address groups of people directly by using *the* with the name of the group.

- *Good morning, **children**.* (not *~~Good morning, the children.~~*)

## Exclamations: *What a …!*

We use *a*/*an* with singular countable nouns in exclamations after *What*.

- ***What a** lovely dress!* (not *~~What lovely dress!~~*)

Note that *a*/*an* cannot be used in exclamations with uncountable nouns.

- ***What** nonsense!* (not *~~What a nonsense!~~*)
- ***What** luck!*

## Illnesses

The names of illnesses and pains are usually uncountable, with no article, in standard British English (for more details, [(see here)](./../nouns-and-noun-phrases-agreement/countable-and-uncountable-nouns-basic-information#illnesses).

- *Have you had **appendicitis**?*
- *I’ve got **toothache** again.*

*A*/*an* is used in a few cases such as *a cold*, *a headache*.

- *I’ve got **a** horrible **cold**.*
- *Have you got **a headache**?*

*The* can be used informally with a few common illnesses.

- *I think I’ve got **(the) flu**.* (AmE always *the flu*)
- *She’s never had **(the) measles**.*

American usage is different in some cases.

- *I’ve got **a toothache** / **an earache** / **a** **backache** / **a stomach ache**.* (BrE *I’ve got toothache/earache*, etc)

## Parts of the body, etc

When talking about someone’s possessions, or parts of their body, we usually use possessives, not *the*.

- *He stood in the doorway, **his coat** over **his arm**.* (not *~~… the coat over the arm.~~*)
- *Katy broke **her arm** climbing.* (not *~~Katy broke the arm climbing.~~*)

But *the* is common after prepositions, especially when we are talking about blows, pains and other things that often happen to parts of people’s bodies [(see here)](./possessive-determiners-my-your-etc#articles-instead-of-possessives-a-pain-in-the-head).

- *She hit him **in the stomach**.*
- *He was shot **in the leg**.*
- *Can’t you look me **in the eye**?*

## Measurements: *by the hour*; *twice a week*

Note the use of *the* in measuring expressions beginning with *by*.

- *Do you sell eggs **by the kilo** or **by the dozen**?*
- *He sits watching TV **by the hour**.*
- *Can I pay **by the month**?*

*A*/*an* is used to relate one measuring unit to another.

- *sixty pence **a** kilo*
- *thirty miles **an** hour*
- *twice **a** week*

## Place names

We use *the* with these kinds of place names:

- seas (***the** Atlantic*)
- mountain groups (***the** Himalayas*)
- island groups (***the** West Indies*)
- rivers (***the** Rhine*)
- deserts (***the** Sahara*)
- most hotels (***the** Grand Hotel*)
- most cinemas and theatres (***the** Odeon*; ***the** Playhouse*)
- most museums and art galleries (***the** British Museum*; ***the** Frick*)

We usually use **no article** with:

- continents, countries, states, counties, departments, etc (*Africa*, *Brazil*, *Texas*, *Berkshire*, *Westphalia*)
- towns (*Oxford*)
- streets (*New Street*, *Willow Road*)
- lakes (*Lake Michigan*)

Exceptions: places whose name is (or contains) a common noun like *republic*, *state*, *union* (e.g. ***the** People’s Republic of China*, ***the** United Kingdom*, ***the** United States*). Note also ***the** Netherlands*, and its seat of government ***The** Hague*. There are a few countries whose names used to have *the*, but are now normally used with no article: *(The) Ukraine*, *(The) Lebanon*, *(The) Gambia*, *(The) Sudan*.

*The* is unusual in the titles of the principal public buildings and organisations of a town, when the title begins with the town name.

- *Oxford University* (not *~~the Oxford University~~*)
- *Hull Station* (not *~~**the** Hull Station~~*)
- *Salisbury Cathedral*
- *Birmingham Airport*
- *Manchester City Council*
- *Cheltenham Football Club*

With the names of less important institutions, usage varies.

- ***(The)** East Oxford Community Centre*
- ***(The)** Newbury School of English*

Names of single mountains vary. Most have no article.

- *Everest*
- *Kilimanjaro*
- *Snowdon*
- *Table Mountain*

But definite articles are usually translated in the English versions of European mountain names, except those beginning *Le Mont*.

- ***The** Meije* (= La Meije)
- ***The** Matterhorn* (= Das Matterhorn)
- but ***Mont Blanc*** (not *~~the Mont Blanc~~*)

## Newspapers and magazines

The names of newspapers usually have *the*.

- ***The** Times*
- ***The** Washington Post*

The names of magazines do not always have *the*.

- *New Scientist*

## Abbreviated styles

We usually leave out articles in abbreviated styles [(see here)](./../written-texts/abbreviated-styles).

- newspaper headlines: *``MAN KILLED ON MOUNTAIN``*
- headings:
  - *Introduction*
  - *Chapter 2*
  - *Section B*
- picture captions: *Mother and child*
- notices, posters, etc: *``SUPER CINEMA``*
- instructions: *Open packet at other end*.
- numbering and labelling:
  - *Go through door A*
  - *Control to Car 27: can you hear me?*
  - *Turn to page 26.* (not *~~… the page 26.~~*)
- (native-speaker) dictionary entries: ***palm** inner surface of hand …*
- lists: *take car to garage; pay phone bill; …*
- notes: *J thinks company needs new office*
