# The difference between *some/any* and no article

## Use with uncountable and plural nouns

Uncountable and plural nouns can often be used either with *some*/*any* or with **no article**. There is not always a great difference of meaning.

- *We need (**some**) **cheese**.*
- *I didn’t buy (**any**) **eggs**.*

*Some* is used especially in affirmative sentences; *any* is more common in questions and negatives (for details, [(see here)](./../determiners-quantifiers/some-and-any-the-main-differences).

## *some*/*any* or no article?

We prefer *some*/*any* when we are thinking about limited but rather indefinite numbers or quantities – when we don’t know, care or say exactly how much/many. We prefer **no article** when we are thinking about unlimited numbers or quantities, or not thinking about numbers/quantities at all. Compare:

- *We’ve planted **some roses** in the garden.* (A limited number; the speaker doesn’t say how many.)  
  *I like **roses**.* (No idea of number.)
- *We got talking to **some students**.* (A limited number.)  
  *Our next-door neighbours are **students**.* (The main idea is classification, not number.)
- *I’ve just bought **some books** on computing.* (A limited number.)  
  *There were **books** on the desk, on the floor, on the chairs, …* (A large number.)
- *Would you like **some** more **rice**?* (An indefinite amount – as much as the listener wants.)  
  *We need **rice**, sugar, eggs, butter, beer, and toilet paper.* (The speaker is thinking just of the things that need to be bought, not of the amounts.)
- *Is there **any water** in the fridge?* (The speaker wants a limited amount.)  
  *Is there **water** on the moon?* (The interest is in the existence of water, not the amount.)
- *This heating system hardly uses **any** oil.* (The interest is in the amount.)  
  *This heating system doesn’t use **oil**.* (The interest is in the type of fuel, not the amount.)

We do not use *some*/*any* when it is clear exactly how much/many we are talking about. Compare:

- *You’ve got **some great books**.*
- *You’ve got **pretty toes**.* (A definite number – ten. *You’ve got some pretty toes* would suggest that the speaker is not making clear how many of them are pretty – perhaps six or seven!)
