# (a) little and (a) few

## Uncountable and plural

We use the determiner *(a) little* with singular (usually uncountable) words, and we use *(a) few* with plurals. Compare:

- *I have **little** interest in politics.*
- ***Few** politicians are really honest.*
- *We’ve got **a little** bacon and **a few** eggs.*

Before another determiner (article, possessive, etc) or a pronoun, we use *(a) little of* and *(a) few of*. Compare:

- *Could I have **a little** butter?*  
  *Could I have **a little of that** butter?*  
  *Could I have **a little of that**?*
- ***Few** people always tell the truth.*  
  ***Few of the** people questioned told the truth.*  
  ***Few of them** told the truth.*

## Use of *a*

There is a difference between *little* and *a little*, and between *few* and *a few*. Without *a*, *little* and *few* usually have rather negative meanings, close to *no* or *none*. They may suggest ‘not as much/many as one would like’, ‘not as much/many as expected’, and similar ideas.

- *The average MP has **little** real power.*
- ***Few** people can speak a foreign language perfectly.*

*A little* and *a few* are more positive: their meaning is generally closer to *some*. They may suggest ideas like ‘better than nothing’ or ‘more than expected’.

- *Would you like **a little** soup?*
- *You don’t need to go shopping. We’ve got **a few** potatoes and some steak.*

Compare:

- *Cactuses need **little** water.* (not much water)  
  *Give the roses **a little** water every day.* (not a lot, but some)
- *His ideas are difficult, and **few** people understand them.*  
  *His ideas are difficult, but **a few** people understand them.*

*Quite a few* (informal) means ‘a considerable number’.

- *We’ve got **quite a few** friends in the village.*

## Formal and informal language

*Little* and *few* (with no article) are rather formal. In an informal style (e.g. ordinary conversation), we generally prefer *not much/many*, or *only a little/few*.

- *Come on! We have**n’t** got **much** time!*
- ***Only a few** people remembered my birthday.*

However, *very little* and *very few* are possible in an informal style.

- *He’s got **very little** patience and **very few** friends.*

## *(a) little* and *(a) few* without nouns

We can drop a noun and use *(a) little/few* alone, if the meaning is clear.

- *‘Some more soup?’ ‘Just **a little**, please.’*

## Not used after *be*

*(A) little* and *(a) few* are determiners. They are normally used before nouns, but not after *be*.

- *They had **little hope**.* (but not *~~Their hope was little.~~*)

## *his few friends*, etc

Note that *few* can follow possessives in expressions like *his few friends*, *my few visits to Scotland*. This is rather formal.
