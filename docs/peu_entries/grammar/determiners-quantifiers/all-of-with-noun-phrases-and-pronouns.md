# *all (of)* with noun phrases and pronouns

## *all* and *all of*

*All* (of) can modify noun phrases and pronouns, especially in American English.

Before a noun with a determiner (for example *the*, *my*, *this*), *all* and *all of* are both possible. *All* is more common than *all of* in British English.

- *She’s eaten **all (of) the cake**.*
- ***All (of) my friends** like riding.*

Before a noun with no determiner, we do not normally use *of*.

- ***All children** can be difficult.* (not *~~All of children …~~*)

## *all of* + personal pronoun

With personal pronouns, we use *all of* + *us*/*you*/*them*.

*All of us/you/them* can be a subject or object.

- ***All of us** can come tomorrow.* (not *~~All we …~~*)
- *She’s invited **all of you**.*
- *Emily sent **all of them** her love.*

## Pronoun + *all*

We can put *all* after pronouns used as objects.

- *She’s invited **you all**.*
- *Emily sent her love to **them all**.*
- *I’ve made **us all** something to eat.*

This does not generally happen with complement pronouns (after *be*) or in short answers.

- *I think that’s **all of them**.* (not *~~I think that’s them all.~~*)
- *‘Who did she invite?’ ‘**All of us**.’* (not *~~Us all.~~*)

*All* can follow a subject pronoun (e.g. ***They all** went home*), but in this case it is positioned with the verb [(see here)](./all-with-the-verb-we-can-all-swim) and may be separated from the pronoun (e.g. ***They** have **all** gone home*).

For the American plural pronoun *you all*, [(see here)](./../pronouns/personal-pronouns-advanced-points#you-different-singular-and-plural-forms).

## Types of noun

*All* is used mostly before uncountable and plural noun phrases.

- *all the **water***
- *all my **friends***

However, *all* can be used before some singular countable nouns referring to things that can naturally be divided into parts.

- *all that **week***
- *all my **family***
- *all the **way***

We can also use *all* (of) before proper nouns (e.g. the names of places or writers), especially in BrE.

- ***All (of) London** knew about her affairs.*
- *I’ve read **all (of) Shakespeare**.*

With other singular countable nouns, it is more natural to use *whole* (e.g. *the whole story*). For details, [(see here)](./all-and-whole).

## Leaving out *the*

After *all*, we sometimes leave out *the* before numbers.

- *all (the) **three** brothers*

And we usually leave out *the* in *all day*, *all night*, *all week*, *all year*, *all winter* and *all summer*.

- *She stayed here **all day**. (not *~~… all the day~~*).*

## *not all …*

It is not very common to use *all* + noun as the subject of a negative verb (e.g. ***All** Americans **don’t like** hamburgers*). We more often use *not all* + noun + affirmative verb.

- ***Not all** Americans **like** hamburgers.*

Note the difference between *not all* and *no*. Compare:

- ***Not all** birds can fly.*
- ***No** birds can play chess.*
