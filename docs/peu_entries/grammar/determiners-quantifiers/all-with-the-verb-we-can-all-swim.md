# All with the verb: *We can all swim.*

When *all* refers to the subject of a clause, it can go with the verb, in ‘mid-position’ (for details of word order, [(see here)](./../adverbs-and-adverbials/mid-position-details).

- *We **can all** swim.*
- *The guests **have all arrived**.*
- *Those apples **were all** bad.*
- *My family **all work** in education.*

Note that these meanings can also be expressed by using *all* (of) with the subject [(see here)](./all-of-with-noun-phrases-and-pronouns).

- ***All of us** can swim.*
- ***All (of) the guests** have arrived.*
