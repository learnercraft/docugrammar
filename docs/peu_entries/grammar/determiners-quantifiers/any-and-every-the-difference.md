# *any* and *every*: the difference

*Any* and *every* can both be used to talk in general about all the members of a class or group.

- ***Any/Every** child can learn to swim.*

The meaning is not quite the same. *Any* looks at things one at a time: it means ‘whichever one you choose’. *Every* looks at things together: its meaning is closer to ‘all’. Compare:

- *‘Which newspaper would you like?’ ‘It doesn’t matter. **Any** one.’*  (= one or another or another) (not *~~… Every one.~~*)
- *On the stand there were newspapers and magazines of **every** kind.* (= one and another and another) (not *~~… magazines of any kind.~~*)
