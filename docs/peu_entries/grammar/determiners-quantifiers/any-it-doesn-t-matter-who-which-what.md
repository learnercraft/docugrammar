# any = ‘it doesn’t matter who/which/what’

*Any* can be used to emphasise the idea of free choice, with the meaning of ‘it doesn’t matter who/which/what’. With this meaning, *any* is common in affirmative clauses as well as questions and negatives, and is often used with singular countable nouns as well as uncountables and plurals. In speech, it is stressed.

- *Ask **any** doctor – they’ll all tell you that alcohol is a poison.*
- *My brother’s looking for work. He’ll take **any** job he can get.*
- *‘When should I come?’ ‘**Any** time.’*

We can use *just any* if necessary to make the meaning clear.

- *I don’t do **just any** work – I choose jobs that interest me.* (*I don’t do any work …* could be misunderstood.)

Note that we use *either* [(see here)](./either), not *any*, to talk about a choice between two alternatives.

- *I can write with **either** hand.* (not *~~… any hand.~~*)

*At all* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/at-all) is often used to emphasise the meaning of *(not) any*.

- *I’ll do **any** job **at all** – even road-sweeping.*
- *She doesn’t speak **any** English **at all**.*
