# Introduction

Determiners in this group are mainly **quantifiers**: they show how much of a class or category we are talking about (*all*, *most*, *some*, *none*, …).

## Other uses

Besides their use as determiners in noun phrases, these words can generally be used without following nouns if the meaning is clear. Compare:

- *He doesn’t eat **any meat**, and not **much fish**.*
- *Fish? He eats **some**, but not **much**.*

This ‘pronoun’ use of quantifiers is dealt with here, and not in [*Pronouns*](../pronouns/pronouns-introduction), for convenience, along with some other uses of these words. For uses not included here, search the Index.

A few words which can have determiner and non-determiner uses (e.g. *other*, *only*, *such*, *which*, *what* and numbers) are covered elsewhere – search the Index.

## Putting determiners together: use of *of*

Quantifiers can be put together if the combination makes sense.

- *We meet ***every few*** days.*
- *Have you got ***any more*** coffee?*

When a quantifier is put together with a ‘group 1’ determiner (article, possessive or demonstrative, [*Determiners: a/an and the; my, your, etc; this, that, etc*)](../determiners-a-an-and-the-my-your-etc-this-that-etc/determiners-a-an-and-the-my-your-etc-this-that-etc-introduction), we use a structure with *of*. Compare:

- ***some** people*  
  ***some of the** people*
- ***each** child*  
  ***each of my** children*
- ***neither** door*  
  ***neither of these** doors*

The same thing happens before a pronoun. Compare:

- ***most** horses*
- ***most of them***

A quantifier with *of* can be used directly before a noun in a few cases. This happens with proper nouns such as place names, and sometimes with uncountable nouns that refer to the whole of a subject or activity.

- ***Most of Wales** was without electricity last night.*
- ***Much of philosophy** is concerned with questions that have no answers.*

*Many*, *most*, *little*, *least*, *few* and *fewest* can follow ‘group 1’ determiners directly in some cases.

- ***his many** friends*  
  ***the most** money*
- ***a little** time*  
  ***the least** difficulty*
- ***these few** poems*  
  ***the fewest** problems*
