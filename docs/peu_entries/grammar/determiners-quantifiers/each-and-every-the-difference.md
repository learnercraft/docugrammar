# *each* and *every*: the difference

## *each* with two or more; *every* with three or more

*Each* and *every* are both normally used with singular nouns. *Each* can be used to talk about two or more people or things; *every* is normally used to talk about three or more.

- *The business makes less money **each/every year**.* (not *~~… each/every years.~~*)
- *She had a child holding on to **each hand**.* (not *~~… every hand.~~*)

:::note

For expressions like *every two years*, *every three steps*, [(see here)](./../nouns-and-noun-phrases-agreement/mixed-singular-and-plural-other-structures#every-frequency).

## Meaning

*Each* and *every* can often be used without much difference of meaning.

- *You look more beautiful **each/every** time I see you.*

But we prefer *each* when we are thinking of people or things separately, one at a time. And *every* is more common when we are thinking of people or things together, in a group. (*Every* is closer to *all*.) So we are more likely to say:

- ***Each person** in turn went to see the doctor.*

but

- ***Every patient** came from the same small village.*

## Structures

We do not use *each* with words and expressions like *almost*, *practically*, *nearly* or *without exception*, which stress the idea of a whole group.

- *She’s lost nearly **every friend** she had.* (not *~~… nearly each friend …~~*)

*Each* can be used in some structures where *every* is impossible.

- *They **each** said what they thought.* (but not *~~They every …~~*)
- ***Each of them** spoke for five minutes.* (but not *~~Every of them …~~*)
