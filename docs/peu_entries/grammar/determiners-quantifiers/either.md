# *either*

## *either* + singular

We use *either* with a singular noun to mean ‘one or the other’ of two.

- *Come on Tuesday or Thursday. **Either day** is OK.* (not *~~Either days …~~*)
- *She didn’t get on with **either parent**.* (not *~~… either parents~~*)

## *either of*

We use *either of* before a determiner (for example *the*, *my*, *these*) or a pronoun. A following noun is plural.

- *You can use **either of the bathrooms**.*
- *I don’t like **either of my history teachers**.*
- *I don’t like **either of them**.*

A verb after *either of* is more often singular, but it can sometimes be plural in an informal style.

- *Either of the children **is** perfectly capable of looking after the baby.*
- *She just doesn’t care what either of her parents **say(s)**.*

## Without a noun

We can use *either* alone if the meaning is clear.

- *‘Would you like tea or coffee?’ ‘I don’t mind. **Either**.’*

## Pronouns

When a pronoun is used later in a clause to refer back to *either* + noun/pronoun, the later pronoun can be singular (more formal) or plural (more informal).

- *If either of the boys phones, tell **him/them** I’ll be in this evening.*

## *either side/end*

In these expressions, *either* sometimes means ‘each’.

- *There are roses on **either side** of the door.*

## Pronunciation

*Either* is pronounced /ˈaɪðə(r)/ or /ˈiːðə(r)/ (in American English usually /ˈiːðər/).
