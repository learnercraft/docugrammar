# *every (one)*

## *every* + singular

*Every* is a determiner. We normally use it before a singular noun (but [(see here)](./every-one#every-plural-noun) below). If the noun is a subject, its verb is also singular.

*every* + singular noun (+ singular verb)

:::

- *I see her **every day**.* (not *~~… every days.~~*)
- ***Every room is** being used.* (not *~~Every room are …~~*)

## *every one of*

We use *every one of* before a pronoun or a determiner (for example *the*, *my*, *these*). The pronoun or noun is plural, but a following verb is singular.

*every one of* + determiner + plural noun (+ singular verb)

:::

- *His books are wonderful. I’ve read **every one of them**.*
- ***Every one of the children was** crying.*

## *every one* without a noun

We can drop a noun and use *every one* alone, if the meaning is clear.

- *His books are great. **Every one**’s worth reading.*

## Negative structures

To negate *every*, we normally use *not every*.

- ***Not every** kind of bird can fly.* (More natural than *Every kind of bird cannot fly*.)

## *every* + plural noun

*Every* is used before a plural noun in expressions that refer to intervals.

- *I see her **every few days**.*
- *There’s a meeting **every six weeks**.*
- *She had to stop and rest **every two or three steps**.*

## *everybody*, etc

*Everybody*, *everyone*, *everything* and *everywhere* are used with singular verbs, like *every*.

- ***Everybody has** gone home.* (not *~~Everybody have …~~*)
- ***Everything** I like **is** either illegal, immoral or fattening.*
- *I found that **everywhere was** closed.*

When possessives and pronouns refer back to *everybody*/*everyone*, they can usually be either singular (more formal) or plural (less formal). Sometimes only a plural word makes sense. Compare:

- *Has **everybody** got **his or her** ticket?* (more formal)
- *Has **everybody** got **their** tickets?* (less formal)
- *When **everybody** had finished eating, the waiters took away **their** plates.* (not *~~… his or her plate.~~*)

Note that *everyone* (= ‘everybody’) does not mean the same as *every one* (which can refer to things as well as people).

## *everyday*

*Everyday* is an adjective meaning ‘ordinary’, ‘usual’, ‘routine’. It is not the same as the adverbial expression *every day*. Compare:

- *In **everyday** life, you don’t often find an elephant in a supermarket.*
- *You don’t see elephants **every day**.*

## Common expressions

Note the following common expressions with *every*.

*every single*

- *She visits her mother **every single** day.*

*every other*

- *We meet **every other** Tuesday.* (= … every second Tuesday.)

*every so often*; *every now and then*

- *We go out for a drink together **every so often** / **every now and then**.*
