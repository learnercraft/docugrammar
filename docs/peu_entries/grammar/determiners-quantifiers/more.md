# more

## *more (of)*

We can use *more* as a determiner before uncountable or plural nouns. Before another determiner (article, possessive, etc) or a pronoun, we use *more of*. Compare:

- *We need **more** butter.*  
  *We need **more of that** salted butter.*  
  *We need **more of it**.*
- ***More** climbers have been found.*  
  ***More of the** missing climbers have been found.*  
  ***More of them** have been found.*

However, *more of* can be used directly before personal and geographical names.

- *It would be nice to see **more of Ray and Barbara**.*
- *Five hundred years ago, much **more of Britain** was covered with trees.*

## *more* without a noun

We can drop a noun after *more* if the meaning is clear.

- *I’d like some **more**, please.*

## *one more*, etc

Note the structure *one more*, *two more*, etc. In this case *more* can be used before a countable noun.

- *There’s just **one more river** to cross.*

## *more* as an adverb

*More* can also be used as an adverb.

- *I couldn’t agree **more**.*

*More and more* is used to talk about continual increase.

- *I hate this job **more and more** as the years go by.*
