# Quantifying expressions: *a lot*, *lots*, *a great deal*, *the majority*, etc

## Introduction; use of *of*

Expressions of this kind have similar meanings to the determiners *much*, *many* and *most*, but the grammar is not quite the same. In particular, *of* is used after these expressions even before nouns with no determiner. Compare:

- *There’s not **a lot of** meat left.* (not *~~There’s not a lot meat left.~~*)  
  *There’s not **much** meat left.* (not *~~There’s not much of meat left.~~*)
- ***Plenty of** shops open on Sunday mornings.* (not *~~Plenty shops …~~*)  
  ***Many** shops open on Sunday mornings.* (not *~~Many of shops …~~*)

## *a lot of* and *lots of*

These are rather informal. In a more formal style, we prefer *a great deal of*, *a large number of*, *much* or *many*. There is not much difference between *a lot of* and *lots of*: they are both used mainly before singular uncountable and plural nouns, and before pronouns. It is the subject, and not the form *lot/lots*, that makes a following verb singular or plural. So when *a lot of* is used before a plural subject, the verb is plural; when *lots of* is used before a singular subject, the verb is singular.

- ***A lot of time is** needed to learn a language.*
- ***Lots of patience** is needed, too.* (not *~~Lots of patience *are* needed, too.~~*)
- ***A lot of my friends want** to emigrate.* (not *~~A lot of my friends *wants* …~~*)
- ***Lots of us** think it’s time for an election.*

## *plenty of*

*Plenty of* is usually rather informal. It is used mostly before singular uncountables and plurals. It suggests ‘enough and more’.

- *Don’t rush. There’s **plenty of time.***
- ***Plenty of shops** sell batteries.*

## *a great deal of*, *a large amount of* and *a large number of*

These are used in similar ways to *a lot of* and *lots of*, but are more formal. *A great deal of* and *a large amount of* are generally used with uncountable nouns.

- *Mr Lucas has spent **a great deal of time** in the Far East.*
- *I’ve thrown out **a large amount of old clothing**.*

*A large number of* is used before plurals, and a following verb is plural.

- ***A large number of problems** still **have** to be solved.* (More common than *A large amount of problems …* ``or`` *A great deal of problems …*)

Some people think it is a mistake to use a plural noun after *a large amount* or *a great deal*, but the usage is quite common in standard English speech.

## *the majority of*

*The majority of* (= ‘most’ or ‘most of’) is mostly used with plural nouns and verbs.

- ***The majority of criminals are** non-violent.*

However, if it is used with a singular noun, any following verb is singular.

- *The majority of his **work is** concerned with children’s artistic development.*

## Not used with measurement nouns

These expressions are not generally used before words for units of measure, like *pounds, years* or *miles*. Other words have to be used.

- *It cost **several** pounds.* (not *~~It cost a lot of pounds.~~*)
- *They lived **many** miles from the town.* (not *~~They lived plenty of miles from the town.~~*)

## Use without following nouns

These expressions can be used without nouns if the meaning is clear. In this case, *of* is not used.

- *‘How much money did it cost?’ ‘**A lot**.’* (not *~~A lot of.~~*)
- *We should be all right for cheese – I’ve bought **plenty**.*
- *He does not often speak, but when he does he says **a great deal**.*
