# *if I were you*

## Advice

We often use the structure *If I were you …* to give advice. British English has *should* or *would* in the main clause; American English *would*.

- *I wouldn’t/shouldn’t worry **if I were you**.*
- ***If I were you**, I’d get that car serviced.*

*If I was you* is also possible. Some people consider it incorrect [(see here)](./special-structures-with-past-tenses-and-would#if-i-were-etc).

## *I should/would …*

Sometimes we leave out *If I were you*, and just use *I should …* (British English) or *I would …* to give advice.

- *I **shouldn’t** worry.*
- *I **would** get that car serviced.*

In this case, *I should/would* is similar to *you should*.
