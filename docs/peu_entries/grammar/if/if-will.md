# *if … will*

:::tip[Examples]

- *I’ll give you £100 if it will help you to get home.*
- *If Anna won’t be here, we’d better cancel the meeting.*
- *I don’t know if I’ll be ready in time.*
- *If you will come this way …*
- *If you will eat so much …*

:::

We normally use a present tense with *if* (and most other conjunctions) to refer to the future [(see here)](./../conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/tense-simplification-in-subordinate-clauses).

- *I’ll phone you if I **have** time.* (not *~~… if I will have time.~~*)

But in certain situations we use *if … will*.

## Results

We use *will* with *if* to talk about what will happen because of possible future actions – to mean ‘if this will be the later result’. Compare:

- *I’ll give you £100 if I **win** the lottery.* (Winning the lottery is a condition – it must happen first.)  
  *I’ll give you £100 if it’**ll help** you to get home.* (The return home is a result – it follows the gift of money.)
- *We’ll go home now if you **get** the car. (condition)*  
  *We’ll go home now if it **will make** you feel better.* (result)

## ‘If it is true now that …’

We use *will* with *if* when we are saying ‘if it is true now that …’ or ‘if we know now that …’.

- *If Anna **won’t be** here on Thursday, we’d better cancel the meeting.*
- *If prices **will** really **come** down in a few months, I’m not going to buy one now.*

## Indirect questions: *I don’t know if* …

We can use *will* after *if* in indirect questions [(see here)](./../noun-clauses-direct-and-indirect-speech/indirect-speech-questions-and-answers#yes-no-questions-he-asked-if).

- *I don’t know if I’**ll be** ready in time.* (not *~~… if I’m ready in time.~~*)

## Polite requests: *If you will come this way …*

We can use *if* + *will* in polite requests. In this case, *will* is not a future auxiliary; it means ‘are willing to’ [(see here)](./../modal-auxiliary-verbs/instructions-and-requests-will-would-can-could-might-shall#instructions-requests-and-suggestions-will-would-can-could-might).

- *If you **will come** this way, I’ll show you your room.*
- *If your mother **will complete** this form, I’ll prepare her ticket.*

*Would* can be used to make a request even more polite.

- *If you **would come** this way …*

## Insistence: *If you WILL eat so much …*

Stressed *will* can be used after *if* to criticise people’s habits or choices.

- *If you **WILL eat** so much, it’s not surprising you feel ill.* (= ‘If you insist on eating so much …’)
