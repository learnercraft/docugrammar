# Ordinary structures

:::tip[Examples]

- *If you didn’t study physics at school, you won’t understand this book.*
- *I’ll give her your love if I see her.*

:::

## The same tenses as with other conjunctions

When we are not talking about ‘unreal’ situations [(see here)](./special-structures-with-past-tenses-and-would), we use the same tenses with *if* as with other conjunctions. Present tenses are used to refer to the present, past tenses to the past, and so on. Compare:

- *Oil **floats** **if** you **pour** it on water.*  
  *Iron **goes** red **when** it **gets** very hot.*
- ***If** Jack **didn’t** **come** to work yesterday, he **was** probably ill.*  
  ***As** Jack **didn’t** **come** to work yesterday, he **was** probably ill.*
- ***If** you **didn’t study** physics at school, you **won’t understand** this book.*  
  ***Because** you **didn’t study** physics at school, you **won’t understand** this book.*

## Present tense with future meaning

In an *if*\-clause, we normally use a present tense to talk about the future. This happens after most conjunctions [(see here)](./../conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/tense-simplification-in-subordinate-clauses). Compare:

- *I’ll give her your love **if** I **see** her.* (not *~~… if I will see her.~~*)  
  *I’ll give her your love **when** I **see** her.* (not *~~… when I will see her.~~*)
- ***If** we **have** fine weather tomorrow, I’m going to paint the windows.*  
  ***As soon as** we **have** fine weather, I’m going to paint the windows.*

:::note

For *if* + *will* (e.g. *if it will make you feel better*), [(see here)](./if-will).

For *if* + *will* in reported speech (e.g. *I don’t know if I’ll be ready*), [(see here)](./../noun-clauses-direct-and-indirect-speech/indirect-speech-questions-and-answers#yes-no-questions-he-asked-if).
