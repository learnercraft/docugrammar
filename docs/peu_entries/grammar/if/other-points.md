# Other points

## *if … happen to*

We can suggest that something is unlikely, or not particularly probable, by using *… happen to …* after *if*.

- ***If** I **happen to** run into Daniel, I’ll tell him to call you.*
- ***If** you **happen to** pass a supermarket, perhaps you could pick up some eggs.*

*Should* can be used after *if* in British English with a similar meaning, but this is now unusual.

- *If I **should** run into Daniel …*

## *if … was/were to*

This is another way of talking about unreal or imaginary future events.

- ***If** the boss **was/were to come in** now, we’d be in real trouble.* (= If the boss came …)
- *What would we do **if** I **was/were to lose** my job?*

It can be used to make a suggestion sound less direct, and so more polite.

- ***If you were to move** your chair a bit, we could all sit down.*

This structure is not normally used with verbs like *be* or *know*, which refer to continuing situations.

- *If I **knew** her name …* (not *~~If I were to know her name …~~*)

:::

## *if it was/were not for*

This structure is used to say that one event or situation changes everything.

- ***If it wasn’t/weren’t for** his wife’s money he’d never be a director.* (= Without his wife’s money, …)
- ***If it wasn’t/weren’t for** the children, we could go skiing next week.*

To talk about the past we use *If it had not been for*.

- ***If it hadn’t been for** your help, I don’t know what I’d have done.*

*But for* can be used to mean ‘if it were not for’ or ‘if it had not been for’.

- ***But for** your help, I don’t know what I’d have done.*

## Leaving out *if*: conversational – *You want to get in, you pay.*

*If* is sometimes left out at the beginning of a sentence in a conversational style, especially when the speaker is making conditions or threats.

- *You want to get in, you pay like everybody else.* (= If you want …)
- *You touch me again, I’ll kick your teeth in.*

## Leaving out *if*: formal inversion structures – *Had I realised …*

In formal and literary styles, *if* can be dropped and an auxiliary verb put before the subject. This happens mostly with *were*, *had* and *should*.

- ***Were she** my daughter, …* (= If she were my daughter …)
- ***Had I** realised what you intended, …* (= If I had realised …)
- ***Should you** change your mind, …* (= If you should change …)

Negatives are not contracted.

- ***Had we not** missed the plane, we would all have been killed in the crash.* (not *~~Hadn’t we missed …~~*)

## Leaving out words after *if*

We sometimes leave out subject + *be* after *if*. Note the common fixed expressions *if necessary*, *if any*, *if anything*, *if ever*, *if in doubt*.

- *I’ll work late tonight **if necessary**.* (= … if it is necessary)
- *There is little **if any** good evidence for flying saucers.*
- *I’m not angry. **If anything**, I feel a little surprised.*
- *He seldom **if ever** travels abroad.*
- ***If in doubt**, ask for help.* (= If you are in doubt …)
- ***If about** to go on a long journey, try to have a good night’s sleep.*

## *if so* and *if not*

After *if*, we can use *so* and *not* instead of repeating a whole clause.

- *Are you free? **If so**, let’s go out for a meal.* (= … If you are free …)
- *I might see you tomorrow. **If not**, then it’ll be Saturday.* (= … If I don’t see you tomorrow …)

## Extra negative: *I wonder if we shouldn’t …*

An extra *not* is sometimes put into *if*\-clauses after expressions suggesting doubt or uncertainty.

- *I wonder **if** we **shouldn’t ask** the doctor to look at Emily.* (= I wonder if we should ask …)
- *I wouldn’t be surprised **if** she **didn’t** get married soon.* (= … if she got married soon.)

## *if … then*

We sometimes construct sentences with *if …* *then* to emphasise that one thing depends on another.

- ***If** she can’t come to us, **then** we’ll have to go and see her.*

## *if* meaning ‘even if’

We can use *if* to mean ‘even if’ [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/even#even-if-and-even-though).

- *I’ll finish this job **if** it takes all night.*
- *I wouldn’t marry you **if** you were the last man in the world.*

## Admitting facts with *if*

An *if*\-clause can be used to admit a fact when giving a reason for it.

- ***If I’m a bit sleepy**, it’s because I was up all night.*

## *if* meaning ‘I’m saying this in case’

*If*\-clauses are quite often used to explain the purpose of a remark – to suggest ‘I’m saying this in case …’

- *There’s some steak in the fridge **if you’re hungry**.*
- ***If you want to go home**, Anne’s got your car keys.*

## *if* meaning ‘although’

In a formal style, *if* can be used with a similar meaning to *although*. This is common in the structure *if* + adjective (with no verb). *If* is not as definite as *although*; it can suggest that what is being talked about is a matter of opinion, or not very important.

- *His style, **if** simple, is pleasant to read.*
- *The profits, **if** a little lower than last year’s, are still extremely healthy.*

The same kind of idea can be expressed with *may … but*.

- *His style **may** be simple, **but** it is pleasant to read.*
