# Other structures found in spoken English

## *would* in both clauses

Conditional *would* is sometimes used in both clauses of an *if*\-sentence. This is very informal, and quite common in speech. It is not usually written, and is incorrect in formal writing.

- *It *would* be good if we*’d*get some rain.*
- *How *would* we feel if this *would* happen to our family?*

:::note

For *if … would* in polite requests, [(see here)](./if-will#polite-requests-if-you-will-come-this-way-).

## *’d have … ’d have*; *would have … would have*

In informal spoken English, *if*\-clauses referring to the past are sometimes constructed with *’d have*. This, too, is very informal, but it occurs quite often in speech. It is not usually written, and is incorrect in formal writing.

- ***If** I’**d have** known, I’d have told you.*
- *It would have been funny **if** she’**d have** recognised him.*
- *You wonder what the attitudes of both players **would have** been if Nadal **would have** gone on and won that second set.* (from a tennis commentary)

## *had’ve* and *would’ve*

Instead of the contracted ’*d* in these structures, full forms are sometimes used for emphasis or in negatives. Both *had* and *would* occur. The following are genuine examples taken from conversation.

- *I didn’t know. But **if** I **had’ve** known …*
- *We would never have met **if** he **hadn’t have** crashed into my car.*
- ***If** I **would’ve** had a gun, somebody might have got hurt.*
- ***If** you **wouldn’t have** phoned her, we’d never have found out what was happening.*

Confusion about this structure sometimes leads people to write *would of* instead of *would have* (they are pronounced the same: /ˈwʊdəv/ in normal speech).

## Mixed tenses

Sometimes a simple past tense is used with *if* where a past perfect would be normal. This is more common in American English.

- **If* I *knew* you were coming, I’d have baked a cake.*
- **If* I *had* the money with me, I would have bought you one.*
- **If* I *didn’t have* my walking boots on, I think I would have really hurt my foot.*
