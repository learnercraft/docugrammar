# Special structures with past tenses and *would*

:::tip[Examples]

- *If I knew her name, I would tell you.*
- *What would you do if you lost your job?*

:::

## Unreal situations

We use special structures with *if* when we are talking about unreal situations – things that will probably not happen, situations that are untrue or imaginary, and similar ideas. In these cases, we use past tenses and *would* to ‘distance’ our language from reality.

## *if* + past; *would* + infinitive

To talk about unreal or improbable situations now or in the future, we use a past tense in the *if*\-clause (even though the meaning is present or future), and *would* + infinitive (without *to*) in the other part of the sentence.

- ***If** I **knew** her name, I **would tell** you. (not *~~If I know …~~*) or *~~If I would know …~~* or *~~… I will tell you.~~**
- *She **would be** perfectly happy if she **had** a car.*
- *What **would** you **do** if you **lost** your job?*

This structure can make suggestions sound less definite, and so more polite.

- *It **would be** nice **if** you **helped** me a bit with the housework.*
- ***Would** it **be** all right **if** I **came** round about seven tomorrow?*

## *would*, *should* and ’*d*

After *I* and *we*, *should* is sometimes used with the same meaning as *would*. This is now unusual in British English, and has almost disappeared from American English.

- *If I knew her name, I **should** tell you.* (rare)

We use *’d* as a contraction [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-formation-and-spelling/contractions-i-ll-don-t-etc).

- *We’**d** get up earlier if there was a good reason to.*

:::note

For *I should …* meaning ‘I advise you to …’, [(see here)](./if-i-were-you#i-shouldwould-).

For *would* in the *if*\-clause, [(see here)](./other-structures-found-in-spoken-english).

For *should* in the *if*\-clause, [(see here)](./other-points#if--happen-to).

## *if I were*, etc

We often use *were* instead of *was* after *if*. This is common in both formal and informal styles. In a formal style *were* is more common than *was*, and many people consider it more correct, especially in American English. The grammatical name for this use of *were* is ‘subjunctive’ [(see here)](./../conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/subjunctive-that-she-go-that-they-be-if-i-were-etc).

- *If I **were** rich, I would spend all my time travelling.*
- *If my nose **were** a little shorter, I’d be quite pretty.*

:::note

For the expression *If I were you …*, [(see here)](./if-i-were-you).

## Ordinary tense-use or special tense-use? *If I come* or *if I came*?

The difference between, for example, *if I come* and *if I came* is not necessarily a difference of time. They can both refer to the future; but the past tense suggests that a future situation is impossible, imaginary or less probable. Compare:

- *If I **become** President, I’ll …* (said by a candidate in an election)  
  *If I **became** President, I’d …* (said by a schoolboy)
- *If I **win** this race, I’ll …* (said by the fastest runner)  
  *If I **won** this race, I’d …* (said by the slowest runner)
- *Will it be all right if I **bring** a friend?* (direct request)  
  *Would it be all right if I **brought** a friend?* (less direct, more polite)

## *could* and *might*

We can use *could* to mean ‘would be able to’ and *might* to mean ‘would perhaps’ or ‘would possibly’.

- *If I had another £500, I **could** buy a car.*
- *If you asked me nicely, I **might** get you a drink.*

:::note

For other cases where a past tense has a present or future meaning, [(see here)](./../past-and-perfect-tenses/past-verb-form-with-present-or-future-meaning).

For *if only*, [(see here)](./if-only).
