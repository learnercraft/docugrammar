# Causative and similar structures with *have*

*Have* can be followed by object + infinitive (without *to*), object + *\-ing*, and object + past participle.

## Causative: *have somebody do/doing something*

*Have* + object + infinitive can mean ‘cause somebody to do something’. This is mostly used in American English, to talk about giving instructions or orders.

- *I’m ready to see Mr Smith. **Have him come in**, please.*
- *The manager **had everybody fill out** a form.*

The structure with an *\-ing* form can mean ‘cause somebody to be doing something’ (BrE and AmE).

- *He **had us laughing** all through the meal.*

For *get* + object + infinitive (meaning ‘persuade somebody/something to do something’), [(see here)](./causative-and-similar-structures-with-get#causative-get-penny-to-help-us).

## Causative: *have something done*

*Have* + object + past participle can mean ‘cause something to be done by somebody else’. The past participle has a passive meaning.

- *I must **have my watch repaired**.* (= I want my watch to be repaired.)
- *I’m going to **have my hair cut** this afternoon.* (= I want my hair to be cut.)
- *If you don’t get out of my house I’ll **have you arrested**.*

*Get* is used in a similar structure, [(see here)](./causative-and-similar-structures-with-get#causative-get-something-done).

## Experience: *have something happen/happening*

In the structure *have* + object + infinitive/…*ing*, *have* can mean ‘experience’.

- *I **had a very strange thing happen** to me when I was fourteen.*
- *We **had a tax inspector come** to the office yesterday.*
- *It’s lovely to **have children playing** in the garden again.*
- *I looked up and found we **had water dripping** through the ceiling.*

Note the difference between the infinitive in the first two examples (for things that happened), and the *\-ing* form in the last two (for things that are/were happening). This is like the difference between simple and progressive tenses [(see here)](./../verbs/progressive-structures#terminology-and-use).

## Experience: *We had our roof blown off.*

*Have* + object + past participle can also be used in the sense of ‘experience’. Again, the past participle has a passive meaning.

- *We **had our roof blown off** in the storm.*
- *I **had my car stolen** last week.*

## *I won’t have …*

*I won’t have* + object + verb form can mean ‘I won’t allow …’

- *I won’t **have you telling** me what to do.*
- *I won’t **have my house turned** into a hotel.*
