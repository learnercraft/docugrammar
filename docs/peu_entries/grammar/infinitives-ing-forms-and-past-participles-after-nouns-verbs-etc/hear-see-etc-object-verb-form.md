# Hear, see, etc + object + verb form

## *I heard him go/going.*

*Hear*, *see*, *watch*, *notice* and similar verbs of perception can be followed by object + infinitive (without *to*) or object + *\-ing* form.

- *I **heard him go** down the stairs.* ``OR`` *I **heard him going** down the stairs.* (not *~~I heard him went down the stairs.~~*)

There is often a difference of meaning. After these verbs, an infinitive suggests that we hear or see the whole of an action or event; an *\-ing* form suggests that we hear or see something in progress, going on. Compare:

- *I **saw her cross** the road.* (= I saw her cross it from one side to the other.)  
  *I **saw her crossing** the road.* (= I saw her in the middle, on her way across.)
- *I once **heard him give** a talk on Japanese politics.*  
  *As I walked past his room I **heard him talking** on the phone.*
- ***Watch me jump** over the stream.*  
  *I like to **watch people walking** in the street.*
- *I **heard the bomb explode**.* (not *~~I heard the bomb exploding.~~*)  
  *I **saw the book lying** on the table.* (not *~~I saw the book lie …~~*)

A progressive form can suggest repetition.

- *I saw her **throwing** stones at the other children.*

After *can see/hear* (which refer to actions and events that are in progress, [(see here)](./../modal-auxiliary-verbs/can-and-could-with-see-hear-etc), only the *\-ing* structure is used.

- *I **could see** Jack **getting** on the bus.* (not *~~I could see Jack get …~~*)

These structures can be used after passive forms of *hear* and *see*. In this case, the infinitive has *to*.

- *He **was** never **heard to say** ‘thank you’ in his life.* (not *~~He was never heard say …~~*)
- *Justice must not only be done; it must **be seen to be done**.*
- *She **was seen walking** away from the accident.*

Passive forms of *watch* and *notice* are not used in this way.

## Possessives not used

After these verbs, possessives cannot be used with *\-ing* forms.

- *I saw **Chloe** talking to Mia.* (not *~~I saw Chloe’s talking to Mia.~~*)

## *I heard my name repeated.*

In this structure, the past participle has a passive meaning.

- *I **heard my name repeated** several times.* (= My name was repeated.)
- *Have you ever **seen a television thrown** through a window?*

The idea of ‘action or event in progress’ can be given by a progressive form (*being* + past participle).

- *As I watched the tree **being cut** down …*
- *I woke up to hear the bedroom door **being opened** slowly.*

## *Look at him eating!*

*Look at* can be followed by object + *\-ing* form, and in American English also by object + infinitive.

- *Look at him **eating**!*
- *Look at him **eat!*** (AmE)
