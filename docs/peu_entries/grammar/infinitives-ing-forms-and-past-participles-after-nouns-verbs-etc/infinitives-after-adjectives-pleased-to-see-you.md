# Infinitives after adjectives: pleased to see you

## Reactions and feelings: *pleased to see you*

Infinitives are often used after adjectives describing reactions and feelings.

- *I’m **pleased to see** you.*
- *We’re **happy to be** here.*
- *She’s **anxious to go** home.*
- *Jack was **surprised to get** Anna’s message.*
- *I was **shocked to see** how ill he was.*
- *Most people are **afraid to hear** the truth about themselves.*

Not all adjectives of this kind are followed by infinitives. Some are followed by preposition + *\-ing* form [(see here)](./ing-forms-after-nouns-and-adjectives-tired-of-listening), or by *that*\-clauses [(see here)](./../adjectives/what-can-follow-an-adjective). Some adjectives (e.g. *afraid*, *sure*) can be followed by either an infinitive or an *\-ing* form, often with a difference of meaning: for details, [(see here)](./infinitives-or-ing-forms-both-possible-with-different-uses#afraid).

:::note

For structures with *for* (e.g. *She’s anxious for the children to go home*), [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-other-uses/for-to).

## Other adjectives: *certain to win*

Besides adjectives referring to reactions and feelings, many other adjectives can be followed by infinitives. Examples: *right*, *wrong*, *stupid*, *certain* [(see here)](./infinitives-or-ing-forms-both-possible-with-different-uses#certain-and-sure), *welcome*, *careful*, *due*, *fit*, *able* [(see here)](./../modal-auxiliary-verbs/be-able-to), *likely* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/likely), *lucky*.

- *We were **right to start** early.*
- *I was **stupid to believe** him.*
- *She’s **certain to win**.*
- *Be **careful not to wake** the children.*
- *It’s very **likely to rain**.*
- *You were **lucky not to be killed**.*
- *You’re **welcome to stay** as long as you like.*

For structures with preparatory *it* (e.g. ***It** is important to get enough sleep*), [(see here)](./../information-structure/preparatory-it-subject).

## Superlatives, etc: *the oldest athlete to win …*

Superlatives can be followed by an infinitive structure. The meaning is similar to an identifying relative clause [(see here)](./../relative-clauses/identifying-and-non-identifying-clauses-the-tall-man-who-mr-rogers-who).

- *He’s the **oldest athlete** ever **to win** an Olympic gold medal.* (= … who has ever won …)

This structure is also common with *first*, *second*, *third*, etc, *next*, *last* and *only*.

- *Who was the **first person to climb** Everest without oxygen?*
- *The **next to arrive** was Mrs Patterson.*
- *She’s the **only scientist to have won** three Nobel prizes.*

This structure is only possible when the superlative has a subject relationship with the infinitive.

- *Is this the first time that you have stayed here?* (not *~~… the first time for you to stay here.~~* *Time* is not the subject of *stay*.)

## *easy to please*

Some adjectives can be used with infinitives in a special structure, in which the subject of the clause is really the object of the infinitive. Examples are *easy*, *hard*, *difficult*, *impossible*, *good*, *ready*, and adjectives after *enough* and *too*.

- *He’s **easy to please**.* (= *To please him is easy.* ``OR`` *It is easy to please him.*)
- *Japanese is **difficult** for Europeans **to learn**.* (= *It is difficult for Europeans to learn Japanese.*)
- *His theory is **impossible to understand**.* (= *It is impossible to understand his theory.*)
- *Are these berries **good to eat**?*
- *The apples were **ripe enough to pick**.*
- *The report is **ready for you to check**.*
- *The box was **too heavy to lift**.*

The structure often ends with a preposition [(see here)](./../prepositions/prepositions-at-the-ends-of-clauses#infinitive-structures-pleasant-to-live-in).

- *She’s nice to talk **to**.*
- *He’s very easy to get on **with**.*
- *It’s not a bad place to live **in**.*

There is no object pronoun after the infinitive or preposition in these cases.

- *Cricket is not very interesting to **watch**.* (not *~~Cricket is not very interesting to watch it.~~*)
- *She’s nice to talk **to**.* (not *~~She’s nice to talk to her.~~*)

When the adjective is before a noun, the infinitive is usually after the noun.

- *It’s a **good** wine **to keep**.* (not *~~It’s a good to keep wine.~~*)

*Easy*, *difficult* and *impossible* cannot be used in this structure when the subject of the clause is the subject of the following verb.

- *She has difficulty learning maths.* (not *~~She is difficult to learn maths.~~*)
- *Iron rusts easily.* (not *~~Iron is easy to rust.~~*)
- *This material can’t possibly catch fire.* (not *~~This material is impossible to catch fire.~~*)
