# Infinitives after nouns and pronouns: *my decision to leave*

## Nouns related to verbs: *no wish to change*

We can use infinitives after some nouns which are related to verbs that can be followed by infinitives (e.g. *wish*, *decide*, *need*).

- *I have no **wish to change**.* (= I do not wish to change.)
- *I told her about my **decision to leave**.* (= I told her that I had decided to leave.)
- *Is there any **need to ask** Jasmine?* (= Do we need to ask Jasmine?)

Not all nouns can be followed by infinitives in this way.

- *I hate the **thought of getting** old.* (not *~~… the thought to get old.~~*)

And note that not all related verbs and nouns are followed by the same structures. Compare:

- *I hope **to arrive**.*  
  *There’s no hope **of arriving**.*
- *She prefers **to live** alone.*  
  *I understand her preference **for living** alone.*
- *I do not intend **to return**.*  
  *I have no intention **of returning**.*

Unfortunately, there is no easy way to decide which structures are possible after a particular noun. It is best to check in a good dictionary.

## Nouns related to adjectives: *You were a fool to agree.*

We can also use infinitives after some nouns which are related to adjectives, or which have an adjectival sense.

- *You were a **fool to agree**.* (= You were foolish to agree.)
- *What a **nuisance to have** to go!* (= How annoying to have to go!)
- *It’s a **pleasure to see** you again.* (= It’s pleasant to see you again.)

## Purpose: *a key to open the door*

An infinitive can be used after a noun, or an indefinite pronoun like *something*, to explain the purpose of a particular thing: what it does, or what somebody does with it. The noun or pronoun can be like the subject of the infinitive.

- *Have you got a **key to open** this door?* (The key will open the door.)
- *It was a **war to end** all wars.*
- *I’d like **something to stop** my toothache.*

The noun or pronoun can also be like the object of the infinitive.

- *I need some more **books to read**.* (I will read the books.)
- *Is there any **milk to put** on the cornflakes?*
- *Did you tell her which **bus to take**?*
- *Is there **anything to drink**?*

If the noun or pronoun is the object of the infinitive, we do not add an object pronoun after the infinitive.

- *I gave her a paper **to read**.* (not *~~… a paper to read it.~~*)
- *He needs a place **to live in**.* (not *~~… a place to live in it.~~*)

*Some*/*any*/*nowhere* can also be followed by infinitives.

- *The kids want **somewhere to practise** their music.*

## *enough*, *too much*, etc

Quantifiers like *enough*, *too much/many/little/few*, *plenty*, etc are often followed by noun + infinitive.

- *There was **enough** light **to see** what I was doing.*
- *There’s **too much** snow (for us) **to be able** to drive.*
- *We’ve got **plenty** of time **to see** the British Museum.*

*Enough* is often dropped before *room* and *time*.

- *There’s hardly **(enough) room to breathe** in here.*
- *Do you think we’ll have **(enough) time to do** some shopping?*

## Infinitive with preposition: *a friend to play with*

A noun can be followed by infinitive + preposition.

- *Emily needs a **friend to play with**.*
- *They’re looking for a **room to meet in**.*

In a very formal style, another structure is possible: noun + preposition + *whom*/*which* + infinitive.

- *Emily needs a friend **with whom to play**.*
- *They’re looking for a room **in which to meet**.*

This is not possible when there is no preposition. One cannot say, for example, **~~I need a book which to read~~**.

## *the life to come*, etc

In expressions like *the life **to come*** (= life after death), *the world **to come***, *his wife **to be*** (= his future wife), the infinitive has a future meaning, and is similar to a relative clause with *be* (= the life/world that is to come, etc).
