# Infinitives after verbs: *It’s beginning to rain.*

After many non-auxiliary verbs, we can use the infinitives of other verbs.

- *It’s **beginning to rain**.*
- *I don’t **want to see** you again.*
- *She **seems to be crying**.*
- *I **expect to have finished** by tomorrow evening.*
- *The car **needs to be cleaned**.*

Common verbs that can be followed by infinitives (for more detailed entries on some of these, search the Index):

- *afford*

- *appear*
- *arrange*
- *ask*
- *attempt*
- *(can’t) bear*

Some of these verbs can be followed by object + infinitive (e.g. *I **want her to be** happy*). For details, [(see here)](./verb-object-infinitive-i-want-you-to-listen). A few verbs are followed by verb + *for* + object + infinitive (e.g. *I **arranged for her to have** violin lessons*). For details of these, [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-other-uses/for-to#after-verbs-ask-for-to).

After some verbs we can use not only an infinitive but also an *\-ing* form (sometimes with a difference of meaning). For details, [(see here)](./infinitives-or-ing-forms-both-possible-with-different-uses).

After some verbs, it is not possible to use an infinitive. Many of these can be followed by *\-ing* forms [(see here)](./ing-forms-after-verbs-i-enjoy-travelling).

- *I **enjoy sailing**.* (not *~~I enjoy to sail.~~*)
