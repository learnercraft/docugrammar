# Introduction

## Verb + verb

Infinitive structures can be used after many verbs; structures with *\-ing* forms can be used after many others.

- *I **want to stop** now.* (not *~~I want stopping now.~~*)
- *We **enjoyed visiting** Edinburgh.* (not *~~We enjoyed to visit Edinburgh.~~*)

Some verbs can also be followed by object + infinitive or object + *\-ing* form.

- *I **expected him to say** something.*
- *Jack didn’t **hear me calling** him.*

After some verbs, more than one of these structures is possible, sometimes with a difference of meaning.

- *I don’t **remember seeing** her before.*
- ***Remember to buy** coffee.*

After some verbs (e.g. *get*, *have*, *hear*), structures with past participles and passive meanings are also possible.

- *We **had** our car **broken into**.*
- *I’ve just **seen** a man **arrested**.*

## Structures after nouns, adjectives and prepositions

Many nouns and adjectives can also be followed by structures with infinitives, and many by preposition + *\-ing*.

- *the **need to invest***
- *an **excuse for leaving***
- ***happy to see** you*
- ***worried about getting** old*

Unfortunately, there is no good way of knowing which verbs, nouns and adjectives are followed by which kind of structure. The more important cases are dealt with in this Section; if in doubt, check in a good dictionary.

Note that prepositions are always followed by *\-ing* forms.

- *She left **without saying** goodbye.* (not *~~… without to say goodbye.~~*)
