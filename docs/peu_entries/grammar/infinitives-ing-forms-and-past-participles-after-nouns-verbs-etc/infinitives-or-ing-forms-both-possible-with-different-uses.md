# Infinitives or -ing forms: both possible with different uses

Some verbs and adjectives can be followed by either *\-ing* forms or infinitives [(see here)](./ing-forms-after-verbs-i-enjoy-travelling#-ing-form-or-infinitive).

- *I **started playing** / **to play** the violin when I was 10.*
- *She was **proud of having** / **to have** won.*

With some of these verbs and adjectives, there is a difference of meaning.

## *remember* and *forget*

*Remember*/*forget* + *\-ing* form looks back at the past – at things that one did. *Forget* *…ing* is used mostly in the phrase *I’ll never forget …ing*, and expressions with similar meanings.

- *I still **remember buying** my first bicycle.*
- *I’ll never **forget meeting** the Queen.*

*Remember*/*forget* + infinitive looks forward in time – at things that one still has or still had to do at the moment of remembering or forgetting.

- *You must **remember to fetch** Mr Lewis from the station tomorrow.*
- *I **forgot to buy** the soap.*

## *go on*

*Go on* + *\-ing* form means ‘continue’.

- *She **went on talking** about her illness until we all went to sleep.*

*Go on* + infinitive refers to a change of activity.

- *She stopped talking about that and **went on to describe** her other problems.*

## *regret*

*Regret* + *\-ing* form looks back at the past – at something that one is sorry that one did.

- *I **regret leaving** school at 16 – it was a big mistake.*

*Regret* + infinitive is used mostly in announcements of bad news.

- *We **regret to inform** passengers that the 14.50 train is one hour late.*
- *We **regret to say** that we are unable to help you.*

## *advise*, *allow*, *permit* and *forbid*

In active clauses after these verbs, we use an *\-ing* form if there is no object. If there is an object we normally use an infinitive. Compare:

- *I wouldn’t **advise taking** the car – there’s nowhere to park.*  
  *I wouldn’t **advise you to take** the car …*
- *We don’t **allow**/**permit smoking** in the lecture room.*  
  *We don’t **allow**/**permit people to smoke** in the lecture room.*
- *The headmistress has **forbidden singing** in the corridors.*  
  *The headmistress has **forbidden children to sing** …*

Note the corresponding passive structures.

- ***Smoking** is not allowed/permitted in the lecture room.*  
  ***People** are not allowed/permitted **to smoke** in the lecture room.*
- ***Singing** is forbidden.*  
  ***Children** are forbidden **to sing**.*
- *Early **reservation** is advised.*  
  ***Passengers** are advised **to reserve** early.*

## *see*, *watch* and *hear*

After these verbs, the difference between object + *\-ing* form and object + infinitive is like the difference between progressive and simple tenses. With *\-ing* forms the verbs suggest that one pays attention to events or actions that are already going on; infinitives usually refer to complete events/actions which are seen/heard from beginning to end. (Note that these verbs are followed by the infinitive without *to*.) Compare:

- *I looked out of the window and **saw Emily crossing** the road.*  
  *I **saw Emily cross** the road and **disappear** into the bank.*
- *As I passed his house I **heard him practising** the piano.*  
  *I once **heard Brendel play** all the Beethoven concertos.*

## *try*

To talk about doing something to see what will happen, we use *try* + *\-ing*.

- *I **tried sending** her flowers, **writing** her letters, **giving** her presents, but she still wouldn’t speak to me.*

To talk about making an effort to do something difficult, we can use either *try* + infinitive or *try* + *\-ing*.

- *I **tried to change** the wheel, but my hands were too cold.* (or I **tried changing** the wheel …)

## *mean*

*Mean* in the sense of ‘involve’, ‘have as a result’ [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/mean) can be followed by an *\-ing* form.

- *If you want to pass the exam, it will **mean studying** hard.*

In the sense of ‘intend’, *mean* is followed by an infinitive.

- *I don’t think she **means to get** married for the moment.*

## *learn* and *teach*

These verbs (and others with similar meanings) are followed by *\-ing* forms mostly when we are referring to lessons or subjects of study.

- *She goes to college twice a week to **learn coding**.*
- *Mr Garland **teaches skiing** in the winter.*

Infinitives are preferred when we talk about the result of the study – about successfully learning a skill.

- *She **learned to read** German at school, but she **learned to speak** it in Germany.*
- *I **taught** myself **to code**.*

## *like*, *love*, *hate* and *prefer*

After these four verbs, both infinitives and *\-ing* forms can often be used without a great difference of meaning.

- *I **hate working** / **to work** at weekends.*
- *I don’t get up on Sundays. I **prefer staying** / **to stay** in bed.*

*Like* + infinitive is used to talk about choices and habits. Compare:

- *I **like climbing** / **to climb** mountains.* (*Like* = ‘enjoy’: both forms possible)
- *When I pour tea I **like to put** the milk in first.* (*Like* = ‘choose’: infinitive more natural)

*Hate* + infinitive can be used to introduce unwelcome news.

- *I **hate to** tell you this, but we’re going to miss the train.*

After *would like*, *would prefer*, *would hate* and *would love*, infinitives are most often used.

- *I’**d like to tell** you something.* (not *~~I’d like telling you something.~~*)

- *‘Can I give you a lift?’ ‘No thanks, I’**d prefer to walk**.’* (not *~~… I’d prefer walking.~~*)

Compare:

- ***Do** you **like dancing**?* (= Do you enjoy dancing?)
- *Would you like **to dance**?* (= Do you want to dance now?)

## *begin* and *start*

*Begin* and *start* can be followed by infinitives or *\-ing* forms. Usually there is no important difference.

- *She **began playing** / **to play** the guitar when she was six.*
- *He **started talking** / **to talk** about golf, and everybody went out of the room.*

After progressive forms of *begin* and *start*, infinitives are preferred.

- *I’**m beginning to learn** karate.* (not *~~I’m beginning learning karate.~~*)

Infinitives are also preferred with *understand*, *realise* and *know*.

- *I slowly **began to understand** how she felt.* (not *~~… began understanding …~~*)
- *He **started to realise** that if you wanted to eat you had to work.* (not *~~… started realising …~~*)

## *attempt*, *intend*, *continue*, *can’t bear*, *be accustomed to*, *be committed to*

After these words and expressions we can generally use either an *\-ing* form or an infinitive without much difference of meaning.

- *I **intend telling** / **to tell** her what I think.*
- *I’m not **accustomed to giving**/**give** personal information about myself to strangers.*

## *-ing* form or infinitive of purpose: *stop*

Some verbs that are followed by *\-ing* forms can also be followed by an infinitive of purpose [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-other-uses/infinitive-of-purpose-i-sat-down-to-rest). A common example is *stop*. Compare:

- *I **stopped running**.* (not *~~… I stopped to run.~~*)
- *I **stopped to rest**.* (= … in order to rest.)

## *afraid*

To talk about fear of things that happen accidentally, we prefer *afraid of* + *\-ing*.

- *I don’t like to drive fast because I’m **afraid of crashing**.*
- *‘Why are you so quiet?’ ‘I’m **afraid of waking** the children.’*

In other cases we can use *afraid of* + *\-ing* or *afraid* + infinitive with no difference of meaning.

- *I’m not **afraid of telling** / **to tell** her the truth.*

## *sorry*

*Sorry for*/*about* + *\-ing* is used to refer to past things that one regrets. (*That*\-clauses are also very common in an informal style.)

- *I’m **sorry for**/**about losing** my temper this morning.* (or I’m **sorry that I lost** my temper.)

*Sorry* + perfect infinitive (more formal) can be used with the same meaning.

- *I’m **sorry to have woken** you up.* (or I’m **sorry that I woke** you up.)

*Sorry* + infinitive is used to apologise for current situations – things that one is doing or going to do, or that one has just done.

- ***Sorry to disturb** you – could I speak to you for a moment?*
- *I’m **sorry to tell** you that you failed the exam.*
- ***Sorry to keep** you waiting – we can start now.*

## *certain* and *sure*

*Certain*/*sure of* + *\-ing* are used to refer to the feelings of the person one is talking about.

- *Before the game she felt **certain of winning**, but after a few minutes she realised it wasn’t going to be so easy.*
- *You seem very **sure of passing** the exam. I hope you’re right.*

*Certain*/*sure* + infinitive refer to the speaker’s or writer’s own feelings.

- *The repairs are **certain to cost** more than you think.* (not *~~The repairs are certain of costing …~~*)
- *Kroftova’s **sure to win** – the other girl hasn’t got a chance.* (= ‘I am sure she will win.’)

## *interested*

To talk about reactions to things one learns, *interested* + infinitive is commonly used.

- *I was **interested to read** in the paper that scientists have found out how to talk to whales.*
- *I’m **interested to see** that Alice and Jake are going out together.*
- *I shall be **interested to see** how long it lasts.*

To talk about a wish to find out something, both *interested in* + *\-ing* and *interested* + infinitive are common.

- *I’m **interested in finding out** / **to find out** what she did with all that money.*
- *Aren’t you **interested in knowing** / **to know** whether I’m pregnant?*

To talk about a wish to do something, we use *interested in* with an *\-ing* form.

- *I’m **interested in working** in Switzerland. Do you know anybody who could help me?* (not *~~I’m interested to work in Switzerland …~~*)
