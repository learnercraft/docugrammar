# -ing forms after verbs: *I enjoy travelling.*

## Verbs that can be followed by *-ing* forms

After some verbs we can use an *\-ing* form (gerund), but not normally an infinitive.

- *I **enjoy travelling**.* (not *~~I enjoy to travel.~~*)
- *He’s **finished repairing** the car.* (not *~~He’s finished to repair …~~*)
- *She’s **given up smoking**.* (not *~~… given up to smoke.~~*)
- *The doctor **suggested taking** a long rest.* (not *~~The doctor suggested to take …~~*)

Some common verbs that are normally followed by *\-ing* forms:

- *admit*
- *appreciate*
- *avoid*
- *burst out (crying/laughing)*
- *consider*
- *contemplate*
- *delay*
- *deny*
- *detest*
- *dislike*
- *endure*
- *enjoy*
- *escape*
- *excuse*
- *face*
- *fancy*
- *feel like*
- *finish*
- *forgive*
- *give up*
- *(can’t) help*
- *imagine*
- *involve*
- *keep (on)*
- *leave off*
- *mention*
- *mind*
- *miss*
- *postpone*
- *practise*
- *put off*
- *resent*
- *resist*
- *risk*
- *(can’t) stand*
- *suggest*
- *understand*

Some verbs can be followed by both *\-ing* forms and infinitives [(see here)](#ing-form-or-infinitive) below).

Unfortunately, there is no easy way to decide which structures are possible after a particular verb. It is best to check in a good dictionary.

## Verb + object + *-ing* form: *I dislike people telling me …*

Some of the verbs listed above, and some others, can be followed by object + *\-ing* form.

- *I **dislike people telling** me what to think.*
- *I can’t **imagine him working** in an office.*
- *Nobody can **stop him doing** what he wants to.*
- *He **spends all his time gardening**.*
- *I **caught the next-door children stealing** my apples.*
- *We **found a dead mouse lying** on the kitchen floor.*

*Stop* (in an informal style) and *prevent* are often followed by object + *from* + *\-ing* form.

- *Try to **stop**/**prevent them (from) finding** out.*

Note that after many verbs we can use possessive + *\-ing* form rather than object + *\-ing* form, especially in a formal style. [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles/ing-form-as-subject-object-or-complement#the-opening-of-parliament-my-smoking) for details.)

## *-ing* form with passive meaning: *Your hair needs cutting.*

After *deserve*, *need* and *require*, the *\-ing* form has a passive sense. This structure is more common in British than American English.

- *I don’t think his article **deserves reading**.* (= … deserves to be read.)
- *Your hair **needs cutting**.* (= … needs to be cut.)

In informal British English, *want* can also be used like this.

- *The car **wants servicing**.* (= … needs to be serviced.)

## *-ing* form or infinitive

After some verbs, either an *\-ing* form or an infinitive can be used. These include:

- *advise*
- *allow*
- *can’t bear*
- *begin*
- *continue*
- *forbid*
- *forget*
- *go*
- *go on*
- *hate*
- *hear*
- *intend*
- *like*
- *love*
- *permit*
- *prefer*
- *propose*
- *regret*
- *remember*
- *see*
- *start*
- *stop*
- *try*
- *watch*

In some cases there is a difference of meaning: [(see here)](./infinitives-or-ing-forms-both-possible-with-different-uses), [(see here)](./hear-see-etc-object-verb-form).
