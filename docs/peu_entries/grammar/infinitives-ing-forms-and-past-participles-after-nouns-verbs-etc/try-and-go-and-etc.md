# *try and …*, *go and …*, etc

## *try / be sure / wait and …*

We often use *and …* instead of *to* after *try / be sure*. This is informal.

- ***Try and** eat something – you’ll feel better if you do.*
- ***I’ll try and** phone you tomorrow morning.*
- ***Be sure and** ask Uncle Joe about his garden.*

Note also the common expression *Wait and see*.

- *‘What’s for lunch?’ ‘**Wait and see**.’*

We only use this structure with the simple base forms *try* / *be sure* / *wait*. It is not possible, for example, with *tries*, *trying*, *was sure* or *waited*. Compare:

- *I **try and keep** a straight face when he talks, but I can’t help smiling.*
- *She **tries to keep** a straight face …* (not *~~She tries and keeps …~~*)
- ***Try and** eat something.*
- *I **tried to** eat something.* (not *~~**I tried and ate** something.~~*)
- *We **waited to see** what would happen.* (not *~~We waited and saw …~~*)

## *come*/*go*, etc *and* …

*Come and …* , *go and …* , *run and …* , *hurry up and …* , *stay and …* are often used informally.

- ***Come and** have a drink.*
- ***Stay and** have dinner.*
- ***Hurry up and** open the door.*

With these verbs, the structure is not only used with the base form.

- *He often **comes and spends** the evening with us.*
- *She **stayed and played** with the children.*
- *She thought of **going and getting** him.*

## American English

In informal American English, *and* is sometimes dropped after the base forms *go* and *come*.

- *Let’s **go see** if Anne’s home.*
- ***Go jump** in the river.*
- ***Come sit** on my lap.*
