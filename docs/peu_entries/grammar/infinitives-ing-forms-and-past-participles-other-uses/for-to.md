# *for … to …*

## Infinitive with its own subject

The structure *for* + noun/pronoun + infinitive is very common in English.

It is used when an infinitive needs its own subject. Compare:

- *Anna will be happy **to help** you.* (Anna will help.)  
  *Anna will be happy **for the children to help** you.* (The children will help.)
- *My idea was **to learn** Russian.*  
  *My idea was **for her to learn** Russian.*
- ***To ask** Joe would be a big mistake.*  
  ***For you to ask** Joe would be a big mistake.* (not *~~You to ask Joe would be …~~*)

Note that the subject of the infinitive is the object of the preposition *for*. Object forms of pronouns are used.

- *Anna will be happy for **them** to help you.* (not *~~… for they to help you.~~*)

## Use

The structure is often used when we are referring to possibility, necessity or frequency, when we are expressing wishes, suggestions or plans for the future, and when we are giving personal reactions to situations. Like other infinitive structures, it is used especially after adjectives, nouns and verbs; it can also act as the subject of a clause. It often has the same meaning as a *that*\-clause, but is generally less formal and often more natural. Compare:

- *It’s important **for the meeting to start** on time.*
- *It’s important **that the meeting should start** on time.*

## After adjectives: *anxious for us to see …*

The structure *for* + object + infinitive can be used after certain adjectives which express wishes and other personal feelings about the importance or value of future events (e.g. *anxious*, *eager*, *delighted*, *willing*, *reluctant*).

- *She’s **anxious for us to see** her work.*
- *I’m **eager for the party to be** a success.*
- *Robert says he’d be **delighted for Emily to come** and stay.*

## *It’s impossible for … to …*

*For*\-structures with preparatory *it* [(see here)](./../information-structure/preparatory-it-subject) are common with many adjectives expressing possibility, necessity, importance, urgency, frequency and value judgements.

- ***It**’s impossible **for the job to be** finished in time.*
- *Would **it** be easy **for you to phone** me tomorrow?*
- ***It**’s important **for the meeting to start** at eight.*
- ***It** seems unnecessary **for him to start** work this week.*
- *I consider **it** essential **for the school to be** well heated.*
- *Is **it** usual **for foxes to come** so close to the town?*
- *I thought **it** strange **for her to be** out so late.*
- ***It**’s not good **for the oil tank to be** so close to the house.*

Other common adjectives that are used in this way include *vital*, *necessary*, *pointless*, *unimportant*, *common*, *normal*, *unusual*, *rare*, *right*, *wrong*. Note that *likely* and *probable* are not used like this.

- *She’s **likely to arrive** this evening.* (not *~~It’s likely for her to arrive this evening.~~*)
- *It’s **probable that she’ll be** in a bad temper. or She’ll probably be …* (not *~~It’s probable for her to be …~~*)

## After nouns: *It’s a good idea for us to …*

The structure can also be used after nouns in expressions with meanings similar to the adjectives listed above. Examples are: *time*, *a good/bad idea*, *plan*, *aim*, *need*, *request*, *mistake*, *shame*.

- *It’s **time for everybody to go** to bed.*
- *It’s a good **idea for us to travel** in separate cars.*
- *There’s a **plan for Jack to spend** a year in Japan.*
- *Our **aim** is **for students to learn** as quickly as possible.*
- *It was a big **mistake for them not to keep** John as manager.*
- *It was a real **shame for them not to win** after all their work.*

## *something for me to do*

*Something*, *anything*, *nothing* and similar words are often followed by *for* + object + infinitive.

- *Have you got **something for me to do**?*
- *There’s **nothing for the cats to eat**.*
- *Is there **anybody for Louise to play** with in the village?*
- *I must find **somewhere for him to practise** the piano.*

## After verbs: *ask for … to …*

*For*\-structures are not normally used as objects after verbs.

- *I need you to help me.* (not *~~I need for you to help me.~~*)

However, verbs which are normally followed by *for* (e.g. *ask*, *hope*, *wait*, *look*, *pay*, *arrange*) can often be used with *for* + object + infinitive.

- *Anna **asked for the designs to be** ready by Friday.*
- *I can’t **wait for them to finish** talking.*
- *Can you **arrange for the gold to be** delivered on Monday?* (not *~~… for the gold being delivered.~~*)

A few other verbs can be used like this, e.g. *suit* and *take* (time).

- *When will it **suit** you **for us to call**?*
- *It **took** twenty minutes **for the smoke to clear**.*

In informal American English, *like*, *hate*, *mean*, *intend* and some other verbs with similar meanings can be used with a *for*\-structure. This is not usually possible in British English.

- *I would **like for you to stay** as long as you want.*
- *She **hates for people to feel** sad.*
- *Did you **mean for Jack to take** the car?*

## After *too* and *enough*

A *for*\-structure is often used after *too* and *enough*.

- *This is much **too** heavy **for you to lift**.*
- *There are **too** many people here **for me to talk** to all of them.*
- *Do you think it’s warm **enough for the snow to melt**?*
- *I explained **enough for her to understand** what was happening.*

## As subject

The *for*\-structure can be the subject of a clause.

- ***For us to fail** now would be a disaster.*
- ***For her to lose** the election would make me very happy.*

However, it is more common for a structure with preparatory *it* to be used [(see here)](./for-to#it-s-impossible-for-to) above).

- ***It** would make me very happy **for her to lose** the election.*

## *for there to be*

The infinitive of *there is* (*there to be*) can be used after *for*.

- *I’m anxious **for there to be** plenty of time for discussion.*
- *It’s important **for there to be** a fire escape at the back of the building.*

## *that*-clauses

Instead of *for* + object + infinitive, a *that*\-clause with *should* or a subjunctive [(see here)](./../conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/subjunctive-that-she-go-that-they-be-if-i-were-etc) is often possible, especially when we want to express wishes, recommendations, suggestions and plans for the future. A *that*\-clause is usually more formal than a *for*\-structure.

- *It is important **that there should be** a fire escape.*
- *I’m anxious **that the party should be** a success.*
- *His idea is **that we should travel** in separate cars.*
- *It is essential **that the meeting start** at eight.*

For sentences like *He made it difficult for us to refuse*, [(see here)](./../information-structure/preparatory-it-object).
