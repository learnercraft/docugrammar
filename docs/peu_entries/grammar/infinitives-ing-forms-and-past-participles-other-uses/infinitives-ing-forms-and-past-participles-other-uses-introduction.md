# Introduction

Infinitives, *\-ing* forms and participles can all begin clauses.

- *I’d like **to look at those papers again**.* (infinitive clause)
- *She ran out **laughing like a hyena**.* (participle clause)
- ***Cooked in a slow oven**, it will taste delicious.* (participle clause)

This Section deals with a few more complex structures of this kind.
