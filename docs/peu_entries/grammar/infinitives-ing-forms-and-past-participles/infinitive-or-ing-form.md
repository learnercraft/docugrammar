# Infinitive or -ing form?

Infinitives and *\-ing* forms are often used in similar ways. For instance, they can follow certain verbs, adjectives or nouns [(*Infinitives, -ing forms and past participles after nouns, verbs, etc*)](../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc-introduction). Compare:

- *He agreed **to wait**.*  
  *He suggested **waiting**.* (not *~~He suggested to wait.~~*)
- *She’s ready to **listen**.*  
  *She’s good at **listening**.* (not *~~She’s good to listen.~~*)
- *the need to **talk***  
  *the idea of **talking*** (not *~~the idea to talk~~*)

Unfortunately, there is no easy way to decide which verbs, adjectives and nouns are followed by *\-ing* forms, and which are followed by infinitives. It is best to check in a good dictionary.

Expressions with *\-ing* forms can be used both as subjects in sentences, or as complements after *be*. Infinitives are less common, especially in informal English. Compare:

- ***Smoking cigarettes** can kill you.* (More natural than *To smoke cigarettes can kill you.*)
- *My favourite activity is **reading thrillers**.* (More natural than *My favourite activity is to read thrillers.*)

**A bad rule**

Students’ grammars sometimes say that infinitives are used when the reference is forward in time, and *\-ing* forms in other cases (as in *I expected **to see** Megan*; *I enjoyed **meeting** her parents*). Unfortunately, this is not a reliable rule: it’s true when it’s true, but there are too many exceptions. (Compare *I anticipated **seeing** her brother*; *I was sorry not **to meet** him*.)
