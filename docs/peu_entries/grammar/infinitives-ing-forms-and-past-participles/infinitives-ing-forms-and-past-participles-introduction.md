# Introduction

This Section, and Sections 9–10, deal with verb forms like *(to) write* (**infinitive**), *speaking* (***\-ing*** **form**) and *seen* (**past participle**). These forms do not themselves have any time reference (unlike for example *writes* or *spoke*), and grammarians call them ‘**non-finite’**. However, they can be used together with auxiliary verbs to form tenses: e.g. *will **write***, *is **speaking***, *has **seen*** [(see here)](./../verbs/verb-verb-auxiliary-verbs). They also have various other uses which are explained in Sections 8–10.

*\-ing* forms have two grammatical names. They are often called ‘**gerunds’** when they are used in similar ways to nouns, as subjects or objects. Gerunds may correspond to infinitives in some other languages.

- ***Smoking** is dangerous.*
- *I enjoy **skiing**.*

They are called ‘**present participles’** when they are used more like verbs or adjectives:

- *She ran out **laughing**.*
- *faster than a **speeding** bullet*

The names ‘present participle’ and ‘past participle’ are misleading, because these forms do not have any particular time reference.

The dividing line between participles and adjectives is not always clear, [(see here)](./participles-ing-and-ed-forms-used-like-adjectives).

All of these verb forms can begin clauses [(*Infinitives, -ing forms and past participles: other uses*)](../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-other-uses/infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-other-uses-introduction).

- *I’d like **to look at those papers again**.* (infinitive clause)
- *She ran out **laughing like a hyena**.* (participle clause)
- ***Cooked in a slow oven**, it will taste delicious.* (participle clause)

For the sake of simplicity, ‘infinitive’ and ‘participle’ are used for infinitive and participle clauses in the following explanations unless the longer term is needed.
