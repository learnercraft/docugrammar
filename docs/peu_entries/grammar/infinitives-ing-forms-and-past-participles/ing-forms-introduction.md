# -ing forms: introduction

## ‘participles’ and ‘gerunds’

We can use *\-ing* forms (e.g. *smoking*, *walking*) not only as verbs, but also like adjectives or nouns. Compare:

- *You’re **smoking** too much these days.* (verb: part of present progressive)
- *There was a **smoking** cigarette end in the ashtray.* (adjective-like: description of *cigarette end*)
- ***Smoking** is bad for you.* (noun-like: subject of sentence)

When *\-ing* forms are used verbally or adjectivally, they are often called ‘**present participles**’. (This is not a very suitable name, because these forms can refer to the past, present or future.) When they are used more like nouns, they are often called ‘**gerunds**’.

Before nouns, both noun-like *\-ing* forms (gerunds) and adjective-like *\-ing* forms (participles) can be used. The two structures do not have quite the same kind of meaning. Compare:

- *a **waiting** room* (= a room for waiting. *Waiting* is a gerund, used rather like a noun. Compare *a guest room*.)  
  *a **waiting** train* (= a train that is waiting. *Waiting* is a participle, used rather like an adjective. Compare *an early train*.)
- *a **sleeping** pill* (**sleeping** is a gerund)  
  *a **sleeping** child* (**sleeping** is a participle)
- ***working** conditions* (gerund)  
  ***working** men and women* (participle)

## Perfect, passive and negative *-ing* forms

Note the structure of perfect, passive and negative *\-ing* forms.

- ***Having slept** for twelve hours, I felt marvellous.* (perfect)
- *She loves **being looked at**.* (passive)
- ***Not knowing** what to do, I went home.* (negative)
- *She’s angry about **not having been invited**.* (negative perfect passive)

## ‘participles’ and ‘gerunds’: an unclear difference

The distinction between ‘participles’ and ‘gerunds’ is not always clear-cut, and it can sometimes be difficult to decide which term to use. For this reason, some grammarians prefer to avoid the terms ‘participle’ and ‘gerund’. For a detailed discussion of this point, see *Comparison*.54 of *A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language*, by Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech and Svartvik (Longman, 1985). In *Practical English Usage* the expression ‘*\-ing* form’ is used except when there is a good reason to use one of the other terms.
