# Cleft sentences: What I need is a rest

## *What I need is …*

In this kind of cleft sentence, the words to be emphasised are connected to a *what*\-clause (or similar structure) by *is*/*was*.

- ***A rest is what I** need.*
- ***A motorbike is what** Emily kept in the garden shed.*

The words to be emphasised are often put last: this gives them even more force.

- *What I need is **a rest**.*
- *What Emily kept in the garden shed was **a motorbike**.*

This structure can be used to emphasise a complement.

- ***The secretary** is what Jake is, actually.* (or Actually, what Jake is is **the secretary**.)

To emphasise words that refer to people, we use structures like *the person who*.

- ***The person who** kept a motorbike in the garden shed was **Emily**.*

Instead of *what* or *the person*, we can use less general expressions.

- *‘Casablanca’ is **a film (that)** I watch again and again.*
- *You’re **the woman (that)** I always see in my dreams.*

A *what*\-clause is normally considered to be singular; if it begins a cleft sentence it is followed by *is*/*was*. But a plural verb is sometimes possible before a plural noun in an informal style.

- *What we want **is**/**are** some of those cakes.*

## *the place where* …; *the day when* …; *the reason why* …

We can use these expressions to emphasise a place, time or reason.

- *Jake spent Tuesday IN LONDON.*  
  *London was **the place where** Jake spent Tuesday.*  
  ***The place where** Jake spent Tuesday was London.*
- *Jake went to London ON TUESDAY.*  
  *Tuesday was **the day when**/**that** Jake went to London.*  
  ***The day when** Jake went to London was Tuesday.*
- *Jake went to London TO SEE TOM..*  
  *To see Tom was **the reason why** Jake went to London.*  
  ***The reason why** Jake went to London was to see Tom.*

*The place*, *the day* or *the reason* can be dropped in an informal style, especially in the middle of a sentence.

- *Spain’s **where** we’re going this year.*
- ***Why** I’m here is to talk about my plans.* (More formal: *The reason why I’m here is …*)

## Emphasising verbs: *What he did was …*

When we want to emphasise a verb (or an expression beginning with a verb), we have to use a more complicated structure with *what … do*. Infinitives with and without *to* are possible.

- ***What** he **did** was (to) scream.*
- ***What** she **does** is (to) write science fiction.*

Instead of an infinitive, we often use subject + verb in an informal style.

- *What she does is, **she writes** science fiction.*
- *What I’ll do is, **I’ll phone** Jack and ask his advice.*

In a very informal style, *is*/*was* may be dropped.

- ***What I’ll do**, I’ll have a word with Dan.*
- ***What they did**, they took his money and then just vanished.*

## Emphasising a whole sentence: *What happened was that …*

A whole sentence can be given extra emphasis by using a cleft structure with *what* and the verb *happen*. Compare:

- *The car broke down.*
- ***What happened** was (that) the car broke down.*

## Other structures

*All (that)*, and expressions with *thing*, can be used in cleft sentences.

- ***All** I want is a home somewhere.*
- ***All** you need is love.*
- ***All** (that) I did was (to) touch the window, and it broke.*
- ***The only thing** I remember is a terrible pain in my head.*
- ***The first thing** was to make some coffee.*
- *My first journey abroad is **something** I shall never forget.*

Time expressions can be emphasised with *It was not until …* and *It was only when …*

- ***It was not until** I met you that I knew real happiness.*
- ***It was only when** I read her email that I realised what was happening.*

At the beginning of a cleft sentence, *this* and *that* often replace emphasised *here* and *there*. Compare:

- *You pay here.*  
  ***This** is where you pay.* (or *Here is where you pay.*)
- *We live there.*  
  ***That**’s where we live.* (or *There’s where we live.*)
