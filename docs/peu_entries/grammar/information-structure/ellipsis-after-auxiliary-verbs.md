# Ellipsis after auxiliary verbs

## Auxiliary instead of complete verb phrase

We can avoid repetition by using an auxiliary verb instead of a complete verb phrase, if the meaning is clear. The auxiliary verb usually has a ‘strong’ pronunciation [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/pronunciation-weak-and-strong-forms), and contractions [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-formation-and-spelling/contractions-i-ll-don-t-etc) are not normally used except in negatives.

- *‘Get up.’ ‘I **am** /æm/.’* (= I am getting up.)
- *He said he’d write, but he **hasn’t**.* (= … hasn’t written.)
- *I’ll come and see you when I **can**.* (= … can come and see you.)
- *‘Shall I tell him what I think?’ ‘I **wouldn’t** if I were you.’*

*Do* can be used before ellipsis if there is no other auxiliary to repeat.

- *I may come to London. I’ll phone you if I **do**.*
- *He said he would arrive before seven, and he **did**.*

Other words, as well as the rest of the verb phrase, can be left out after the auxiliary.

- *I can’t see you today, but I **can** tomorrow.* (= … I can see you …)
- *‘I’ve forgotten the address.’ ‘I **have** too.’*
- *‘You’re not trying very hard.’ ‘I **am**.’*
- *‘You wouldn’t have won if I hadn’t helped you.’ ‘Yes, I **would (have)**.’*

This also happens after non-auxiliary *be* and *have*.

- *‘I’m tired.’ ‘I **am** too.’*
- *‘Who’s the driver?’ ‘I **am**.’*
- *‘Who has a dictionary?’ ‘I **have**.’*

## Short answers, etc: *Yes, I have*

Ellipsis is used regularly in short answers [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/short-answers-yes-he-can-etc), reply questions [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/reply-questions-was-it-did-you-dear) and question tags ( [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/question-tags-basic-information).

- *‘Have you finished?’ ‘Yes, I **have**.’*
- *‘I can whistle through my fingers.’ ‘**Can** you, dear?’*
- *You don’t want to buy a car, **do** you?*

## *so am I*, etc

Ellipsis also happens after *so*, *neither* and *nor* [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/so-am-i-neither-do-they-etc). Note the word order.

- *‘I’ve forgotten the address.’ ‘So **have** I.’*
- *She doesn’t like olives, and neither **do** I.*

## Ellipsis before complete form: *If you can, call me …*

Ellipsis normally happens when an expression is used for a second time, after the complete form has already been used once (see above examples). However, it can sometimes happen the other way round. This is common in sentences beginning with *if*.

- ***If** you **can**, call me when you arrive.*
- ***If** you **could**, I’d like you to help me this evening.*
- ***If** you **prefer**, we can go tomorrow instead.*

## More than one auxiliary: *I could have been.*

When there is more than one auxiliary, ellipsis usually happens after the first.

- *‘You wouldn’t have enjoyed the film.’ ‘Yes, I **would**.’* (= … I would have enjoyed the film.)

However, more auxiliaries can be included. The first is stressed.

- *‘Could you have been dreaming?’ ‘I suppose I **could** / **``COULD`` have** / **``COULD`` have been**.’*

We often include a second auxiliary verb if it has not appeared before in the same form.

- *‘I think Emily should **be** told.’ ‘She **has been.**’* (More natural than … *She has*.)

And we normally include a second auxiliary verb after a change of modal auxiliary.

- *‘Emily **should be** told.’ ‘She **must be**.’* (More natural than … *She must*.)

## Substitution with *do*: *He might do.*

In British English, a main verb that is left out after an auxiliary can be replaced by *do*. For details, [(see here)](./../be-have-and-do/do-substitute-verb-i-may-do).

- *‘Do you think he’ll phone?’ ‘He might **do**.’* (AmE *… He might*.)

For *do so*, [(see here)](./../be-have-and-do/do-so-it-that).
