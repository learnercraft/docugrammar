# Ellipsis in noun phrases

## Ellipsis after adjectives ,*please*

A repeated noun can sometimes be dropped after an adjective, if the meaning is clear, especially when one is talking about common kinds of choice.

- *‘What kind of potatoes would you like?’ ‘**Boiled** (potatoes), please.’*
- *We haven’t got any brown sugar. Only **white** (sugar).*

This often happens after superlatives.

- *I think I’ll buy the **cheapest**.*

:::note

For other structures in which adjectives are used without nouns, [(see here)](./../adjectives/adjectives-without-nouns).

## Ellipsis after *this*, *numbers*, *possessives*, etc

Nouns can also be dropped after most determiners ( [*Determiners: a/an and the; my, your, etc; this, that, etc*](../determiners-a-an-and-the-my-your-etc-this-that-etc/determiners-a-an-and-the-my-your-etc-this-that-etc-introduction), [*Determiners: quantifiers*)](../determiners-quantifiers/determiners-quantifiers-introduction), if the meaning is clear.

- *This is Ella’s coat, and **that** (coat) is mine.*

This also happens after numbers, nouns with possessive ’*s*, *own* and *(an)other*.

- *I’m not sure how many packets I need, but I’ll take **two** (packets) to start with.*
- *Our train’s the **second** (train) from this platform.*
- *You take Dan’s car, and I’ll take **Susie’s** (car).*
- *‘Can I borrow your pen?’ ‘No, find your **own** (pen).’*
- *‘That beer went down fast.’ ‘Have **another** (beer).’*

## Well-known names

The last words of well-known names are often dropped.

- *She’s playing the **Beethoven** with the **Scottish National** tomorrow night.* (= … the Beethoven violin concerto with the Scottish National Orchestra …)
- *He’s staying at the **Hilton**.* (= … the Hilton Hotel.)
- *We’re going to see ‘Hamlet’ at the **Mermaid**.* (= … the Mermaid Theatre.)

When we talk about people’s homes, and about shops and offices, possessives are often used without following nouns.

- *We spent the weekend at **Jack and Emily’s**.*
- *Could you pick up some chops from the **butcher’s**?*
- *I’m going to call in at the **doctor’s** on the way home.*

## Other situations

Note that nouns are not normally dropped in other situations.

- *The most important **thing** is to keep calm.* (not *~~The most important is to …~~*)
