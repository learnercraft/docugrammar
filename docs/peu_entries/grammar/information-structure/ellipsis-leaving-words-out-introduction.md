# Ellipsis (leaving words out): introduction

We often leave out words to avoid repetition, or in other cases when the meaning can be understood without them. This is called ‘ellipsis’.

## Replies

In replies we usually avoid repeating information that has just been given.

- *‘What time are you coming?’ ‘About ten.’* (More likely than ‘*I’m coming about ten*’.)
- *‘Who said that?’ ‘Jack.’* (More likely than ‘*Jack said that*’.)
- *‘How many chairs do you need?’ ‘Three.’* (More likely than ‘*I need three chairs*’.)
- *‘She’s out this evening?’ ‘Yes, working.’* (More likely than ‘*Yes, she’s working this evening*’.)

## Structures with *and*, *but* and *or*

Repeated words are often dropped in co-ordinate structures [(see here)](./ellipsis-with-and-but-and-or).

- *a knife **and fork*** (= a knife and a fork)
- *She was poor **but happy**.* (= … but she was happy.)

## At the beginning of a sentence

In informal speech, unstressed words are often dropped at the beginning of a sentence, if the meaning is clear. For details, [(see here)](./ellipsis-at-the-beginning-of-a-sentence).

- ***Seen** Lucy?* (= Have you seen Lucy?)
- ***Doesn’t** know what she’s talking about.* (= She doesn’t …)

## At the end of a noun phrase

It is sometimes possible to drop nouns after adjectives, noun modifiers and/or determiners. For details, [(see here)](./ellipsis-in-noun-phrases).

- *‘Do you want large eggs?’ ‘No, I’ll have **small**.’* (= … small eggs.)
- *My car isn’t working. I’ll have to use **Emily’s**.* (= … Emily’s car.)
- *We’re going to hear the **London Philharmonic** tonight.* (= … the London Philharmonic Orchestra.)
- *‘Which shoes are you going to wear?’ ‘**These**.’* (= These shoes.)

## At the end of a verb phrase

Auxiliary verbs are often used alone instead of full verbs. For details, [(see here)](./ellipsis-after-auxiliary-verbs).

- *‘I haven’t paid.’ ‘I **haven’t** either.’* (= … I haven’t paid either.)
- *She said she’d phone, but she **didn’t**.* (= … didn’t phone.)

This type of ellipsis can include complements that follow the verb.

- *I was planning to go to Paris next week, but I **can’t**.* (= … I can’t go to Paris next week.)

The same structures are possible with non-auxiliary *be* and *have*.

- *I thought she would be angry, and she **was**.*
- *He says he hasn’t any friends, but I know he **has**.*

## Infinitives

We can use *to* instead of repeating a whole infinitive. For details, [(see here)](./ellipsis-infinitives).

- *‘Are you and Gillian getting married?’ ‘We hope **to**.’* (= We hope to get married.)
- *I don’t dance much now, but I used **to** a lot.*

Sometimes a whole infinitive, including *to*, is left out.

- *Come when you **want**.* (= … when you want to come.)
- *‘Have a good time.’ ‘I’ll **try**.’* (= I’ll try to have a good time.)

## Comparative structures with *as* and *than*

We can leave out words after *as* and *than*, if the meaning is clear.

- *The weather isn’t as good **as last year**.* (= … as it was last year.)
- *I found more blackberries **than you**.* (= … than you found.)

:::note

For missing subject or object after *as* and *than* (e.g. *as was expected*), [(see here)](./../other-adverbial-clauses/than-and-as-clauses-leaving-out-subjects-etc).

## Question-word clauses

Clauses can be dropped after question words.

- *Somebody has been stealing our flowers, but I don’t know **who**.* (= … I don’t know who has been stealing our flowers.)
- *Become a successful writer. This book shows you **how**.*

## *that* and relative pronouns

In an informal style, the conjunction *that* is often dropped [(see here)](./../noun-clauses-direct-and-indirect-speech/leaving-out-that); object relative pronouns can also be dropped [(see here)](./../relative-clauses/identifying-and-non-identifying-clauses-the-tall-man-who-mr-rogers-who#leaving-out-object-pronouns).

- *I knew (**that**) she didn’t want to help me.*
- *This is the restaurant (**which**) I was talking about.*

## Reduced relative structures: *the tickets available*, etc

We can sometimes leave out a relative pronoun and the verb *be* before participles, or adjectives such as *available*, *possible*. For details, [(see here)](./../relative-clauses/relatives-advanced-points#reduced-relative-clauses-the-girl-dancing).

- *Who’s the girl **dancing** with your brother?* (= … who is dancing …)
- *It will not be possible to finish the job in the time **available**.* (= … that is available.)

## *be* after conjunctions

Subject pronouns with forms of *be* can be left out after certain conjunctions, especially in a formal style.

- *Start **when ready**.* (= … when you are ready.)
- ***Though intelligent**, he was very poorly educated.* (= Though he was intelligent …)
- ***When ordering**, please send £1.50 for postage and packing.*
- *Phone me **if** (**it is**) **necessary**.*
- *He had a small heart attack **while asleep**.*
- *I’m enclosing the signed contract, **as agreed**.*
- *Leave in oven **until browned on top**.*

## Prepositions

In an informal style, prepositions can be dropped in a few time expressions ( [(see here)](./../prepositions/expressions-without-prepositions#next-last-etc).

- *See you (**on**) Monday night.*
- *We’re staying here (**for**) another three months.*
- *What time shall I come?* (More natural than *At what time …?*)

:::note

For cases like *We need a place to live (**in**)*, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/place-a-place-to-live-etc).

## Pronouns after prepositions

In British English, pronoun objects can sometimes be dropped after prepositions. This happens, for example, when *have* or *with* are used in descriptive structures.

- *My socks have got holes *in* (them).*
- *I’d like a piece of toast with butter *on* (it).*

## Abbreviated styles

In certain styles, many or all non-essential words can be dropped. For details, [(see here)](./../written-texts/abbreviated-styles).

- *Take 500g butter and place in small saucepan.*
- *Single man looking for flat Oxford area.*
- *``DOG FINDS ROMAN TREASURE``*
