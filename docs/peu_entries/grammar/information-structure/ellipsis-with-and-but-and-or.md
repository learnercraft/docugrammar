# Ellipsis with and, but and or

## Various kinds of word left out

When expressions are joined by *and*, *but* or *or*, we often leave out repeated words or phrases of various kinds.

- *a knife **and** (a) fork*
- *these men **and** (these) women*
- *ripe apples **and** (ripe) pears*
- *antique (furniture) **or** modern furniture*
- *in France, (in) Germany **or** (in) Spain*
- *She can read, **but** (she) can’t write.*
- *The Minister likes golf **but** (the Minister) hates fishing.*
- *We drove (across America), rode (across America), flew (across America) **and** walked across America.*
- *She was poor **but** (she was) happy.*
- *The food (is ready) **and** the drinks are ready.*
- *Jake (washed the dishes) **and** Sophie washed the dishes.*

We can sometimes drop a verb that is repeated in a different form.

- *I have always **paid** my bills and I always will (**pay** …).*

## Word order

Note that when two verbs, objects, etc are the same, it is not always the second that is left out. We may have to leave out the first to avoid confusion, or to produce a simpler word order and sentence structure.

- *Cats (catch mice) and dogs catch mice.* (not *~~Cats catch mice and dogs.~~*)
- *I can (go) and will go.*

In informal speech and writing, ellipsis does not usually interrupt the normal word order of a clause or sentence. Sentences like the following are typical of a more formal style.

- *Daniel planned and Megan paid for the trip.* (Less formal: *Daniel planned the trip and Megan paid for it*.)
- *Kevin likes dancing and Annie athletics.* (Less formal: *Kevin likes dancing and Annie likes athletics*.)
- *The children will carry the small boxes and the adults the large ones.*
- *Megan went to Greece and Alice to Rome.*
- *You seem, and she certainly is, ill.*

## Other conjunctions

Ellipsis is not normally possible after other conjunctions besides *and*, *but* and *or*.

- *She didn’t know where she was **when** she woke up.* (not *~~… when woke up.~~*)

However, ellipsis of subject pronouns with forms of *be* is possible in some cases (e.g. *if possible*, *when arriving*), [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-other-uses/participle-clauses#participle-clauses-after-conjunctions-and-prepositions), [(see here)](./../if/other-points#leaving-out-words-after-if), [(see here)](./../other-adverbial-clauses/as-when-and-while-simultaneous-events#reduced-clauses-with-when-and-while).

## *(and) then*

In an informal style, ellipsis is sometimes possible after *then*, even if *and* is dropped.

- *Daniel started first, (and) **then** Tom (started).*
