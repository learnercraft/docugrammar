# Fronting: This question we have already discussed

## *People like that I just can’t stand.*

Affirmative sentences most often begin with the grammatical subject.

- ***I** just can’t stand people like that.*

If we begin a sentence with something else (‘fronting’), this is often to make it the topic – the thing we are talking about – even though it is not the grammatical subject. This can also move the main new information to the end – its most natural position [(see here)](./information-structure-normal-order-and-variations).

- ***This question** we have already discussed at some length.*
- ***All the other information which you need** I am sending today.* (from a business letter)
- ***Any video in our catalogue** we can supply, if available.* (notice in music shop)

Fronting is particularly common in speech.

- ***People like that** I just can’t stand.*
- ***These books** I’m just going to give away.*
- ***(A) fat lot of good** that does me.* (= ‘That doesn’t do me much good’, but putting strong emphasis on *me*.)

Question-word clauses [(see here)](./../noun-clauses-direct-and-indirect-speech/interrogative-question-word-clauses) are often fronted.

- ***What I’m going to do next** I just don’t know.*
- ***How she got the gun through customs** we never found out.*

## *Very good lesson we had.*

Fronting words in short sentences can also give them extra emphasis. This happens mostly in speech.

- ***Strange people** they are!*
- ***Very good lesson** we had yesterday.*
- ***Last for ever** these shoes will.*

In a few exclamatory expressions, a noun is fronted before *that*, but this is uncommon in modern English.

- ***Fool** that I was!*

## Adverbs, etc: *Off we go!*

Many adverbs and adverbial expressions can go at the beginning of a clause ( [(see here)](../adverbs-and-adverbials/position-of-adverbials-introduction). This often happens when we are using the adverbs to structure a piece of narrative or a description.

- *Once upon a time there were three little pigs. One day … Then … Soon after that … After dark, …*
- *Inside the front door there is … Opposite the living room is … On the right you can see … At the top of the stairs …*

Adverb particles are often fronted when giving instructions to small children.

- ***Off** we go!*
- ***Down** you come!*

Inversion ( [(see here)](./inversion-auxiliary-verb-before-subject) is necessary after some emphatic fronted adverbs and adverbial expressions.

- *Under no circumstances **can tickets** be exchanged.* (not *~~Under no circumstances tickets can …~~*)
- *Round the corner **came Mrs Porter**.*

## Fronting with *as* or *though*

Fronted adjectives and adverbs are possible in a structure with *as* or *though* [(see here)](./../other-adverbial-clauses/as-and-though-special-word-order).

- ***Young as I was**, I realised what was happening.*
- ***Tired though she was**, she went on working.*
- ***Fast though she drove**, she could not catch them.*
- ***Much as I respect his work**, I cannot agree with him.*
