# Introduction

Sentences are not usually isolated: they mostly fit into longer pieces of communication, for example written texts or spoken exchanges. So the way we choose to organise the information in a clause or sentence will partly depend on things outside the sentence: for example what has been said before, or what is already known, or what the speaker or writer wants to emphasise. This is a complicated area of grammar in all languages. This Section looks at ways in which English allows speakers and writers to arrange information in sentences effectively, both by using normal sentence structure and by varying the normal order. The structure of longer texts and exchanges is looked at in [*Written text*](../written-texts/written-texts-introduction) and [*Speech and spoken exchanges*](../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/speech-and-spoken-exchanges-introduction).
