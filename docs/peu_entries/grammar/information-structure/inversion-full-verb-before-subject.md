# Inversion: full verb before subject

## After adverbial expressions of place: *Along the road came …*

When an adverbial expression of place or direction comes at the beginning of a clause, intransitive verbs are often put before their subjects. This happens especially when a new indefinite subject is being introduced. The structure is most common in literary and descriptive writing.

- *Under a tree **was lying one of the biggest men** I had ever seen.*
- *On the grass **sat an enormous frog**.*
- *Directly in front of them **stood a great castle**.*
- *Along the road **came a strange procession**.*

This structure is often used in speech with *here*, *there* and other short adverbs and adverb particles.

- *Here **comes Freddy**!* (not *~~Here Freddy comes!~~*)
- *There **goes your brother**.*
- *I stopped the car, and up **walked a police officer**.*
- *The door opened and out **came Angela’s boyfriend**.*

If the subject is a pronoun, it goes before the verb.

- *Here **she comes**.* (not *~~Here comes she.~~*)
- *Off **we go**!*

Inversion is normal in *here*/*there is*/*are* …

- ***Here are** your keys.* (not *~~Here your keys are.~~*)
- *Look – **there’s** the bus.*

In informal speech, *here’s* and *there’s* often introduce plural subjects [(see here)](./../nouns-and-noun-phrases-agreement/mixed-singular-and-plural-other-structures#here-s-there-s-and-where-s).

- ***Here’s** those papers you wanted.*

## Reporting: *‘What do you mean?’ asked Henry.*

In story-telling, the subject often comes after reporting verbs like *said*, *asked*, *suggested*, etc when these follow direct speech.

- *‘What do you mean?’ **asked Henry**.* (or *… Henry asked.*)
- *‘I love you,’ **whispered Jess**.*

If the subject is a pronoun, it usually comes before the verb.

- *‘What do you mean?’ **he asked**.*
