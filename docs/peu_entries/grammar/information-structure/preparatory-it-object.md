# Preparatory it: object

## *I find it difficult to talk to you.*

We can sometimes use *it* as a ‘**preparatory object**’. This happens when the object of a verb is an infinitive or a clause, and when this has an adjective or noun complement. For example, instead of saying ‘*I find ***to talk to you difficult****’, we prefer ‘*I find ***it*** difficult ***to talk to you****’.

:::tip[Grammar]

subject + verb + *it* + complement + infinitive/clause

:::

- *We found **it** tiring **to listen to him**.*
- *My blister made **it** a problem **to walk**.*
- *I thought **it** strange **that she hadn’t written**.*
- *George made **it** clear **what he wanted**.*

*It* is quite often dropped from *make (it) clear that …*

- *The Prime Minister **has made clear that** he will not allow a free vote.*

Note that this structure is not normally used when there is no adjective or noun complement after the verb.

- *I cannot bear to see people crying.* (not *~~I cannot bear it to see people crying.~~*)
- *I remember that we were very happy.* (not *~~I remember it that …~~*)

But note the structure *I like/love/hate it when …*

- ***I love it when** you sing.*
- ***I hate it when** strangers use my first name.*

Note also the idiom *I take it that …* (= I assume that …).

- ***I take it that** you won’t be working tomorrow.*

## *I found it strange being …*

This structure is also possible with *\-ing* form objects.

- *I found **it** strange **being** in her house.*

## *I would appreciate it if* …

*It* is used as a preparatory object for an *if*\-clause after *would appreciate*.

- *I **would appreciate it if** you would keep me informed.* (not *~~I would appreciate if you would …~~*)

## *owe* and *leave*

Note the structures *owe it to somebody to …* and *leave it to somebody to …*

- *We **owe it to society to** make our country a better place.*
- *I’ll **leave it to you to** decide.*
