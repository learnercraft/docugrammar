# Ability: *can* and *could*

## Knowledge, skill, strength, etc: *I can read Italian.*

We use *can* to say what people and things are able (or unable) to do because of their knowledge, skill, strength, nature, design, etc.

- *I **can** read Italian, but I **can’t** speak it.*
- *Dogs **can’t** climb trees.*
- *Henry **can** lift 100 kilos.*
- *These roses **can** grow anywhere.*
- ***Can** gases freeze?*
- *My car **can** do 150mph.*

*Be able to* [(see here)](./be-able-to) is used with similar meanings, especially when we are talking about people’s ability.

- *Henry **is able to** lift 100 kilos.*

## Possible in the situation: *We can go to Paris.*

We also use *can* to say what we are able (or unable) to do because of the circumstances that we are in – what is possible in the situation.

- *We **can** go to Paris this weekend, because I don’t have to work.*
- *I **can’t** come out this evening: I have to see my brother.*
- *There are three possibilities: we **can** go to the police, we **can** talk to a lawyer, or we **can** forget all about it.*
- *‘What **can** we do?’ ‘We **can** try asking Lucy for help.’*
- *Anybody who wants to **can** join the club.*

## Past: *She could read when she was four.*

We use *could* to talk about general ability in the past.

- *She **could** read when she was four.*
- *My grandmother **could** sing like an angel.*
- *My last car **could** do 160mph.*
- *In those days everybody **could** find a job.*
- *It **could** be quite frightening if you were alone in our big old house.*

*Was/were able to* is also possible, especially to talk about people’s ability.

- *She **was able to** read when she was four.*

## Past: *could* is not always possible

We use *could* for ‘general ability’ – for example to say that somebody could do something at any time, whenever he/she wanted.

- *When I was younger, I **could** run 10km in under 40 minutes.*

We do not normally use *could* to say that somebody did something on one occasion. Instead, we use other expressions.

- *I **managed to** run 10km yesterday in under an hour.* (not *~~I could run 10km yesterday …~~*)
- *How many eggs **were** you **able to** get?* (not *~~… could you get?~~*)
- *After six hours’ climbing, we **succeeded in** getting to the top of the mountain.* (not *~~… we could get to the top …~~*)
- *I **found** a really nice dress in the sale.* (not *~~I could find …~~*)

However, we use *couldn’t* to say that something did not happen on one occasion.

- *I managed to find the street, but I **couldn’t** find her house.*

## Other uses of *could*

*Could* is not only past: we also use it as a ‘softer’, less definite form of *can*.

- *‘What shall we do tomorrow?’ ‘Well, we **could** go fishing.’*
- *When you’re in Spain, you **could** go and see Alex.*

*Could* can mean ‘would be able to’.

- *You **could** get a better job if you spoke a foreign language.*

*Could* is used in past indirect speech, when *can* was used in direct speech.

- *‘**Can** you help me?’ ‘What did you say?’ ‘I asked if you **could** help me.’*

## *could have …*

We use a special structure to talk about unrealised past ability or opportunities – to say that somebody was able to do something, but did not do it; or that something was possible, but did not happen.

:::tip[Grammar]

*could have* + past participle

:::

- *I **could have married** anybody I wanted to.*
- *I was so angry I **could have killed** her!*
- *Why did you jump out of the window? You **could have hurt** yourself.*
- *I **could have won** the race if I hadn’t fallen.*

This structure can be used to criticise people for not doing things.

- *You **could have helped** me – why did you just sit and watch?*

Negative sentences suggest that somebody would not have been able to do something even if they had wanted or tried to.

- *I **couldn’t have won**, so I didn’t go in for the race.*
- *I **couldn’t have enjoyed** myself more – it was a perfect day.*

The structure is sometimes used to talk about past events which are not certain to have happened (like *may/might have* – [(see here)](./chances-may-might-and-could#may-might-could-have-she-may-have-missed-her-train).

- *‘Who sent those flowers?’ ‘I’m not sure. It **could have been** your mother.’*

This structure can also refer to present situations which were possible but which have not been realised.

- *He **could have been** Prime Minister now if he hadn’t decided to leave politics.*
- *We **could have spent** today at the beach, but we thought it was going to rain so we decided not to go.*

## Chances: *Will it happen?* / *Is it happening?* – *can* not used

We do not use *can* to talk about the chances (probability) that something will actually happen, or is actually happening. Instead, we use *may* [(see here)](./chances-may-might-and-could).

- *We **may** go camping this summer.* (not *~~We can go …~~*)
- *‘Where’s Sarah?’ ‘She **may** be with Joe.’* (not *~~She can be …~~*)

However, *could* is possible in this sense.

- *It **could** rain later this evening, perhaps.* (but not *~~It can rain later …~~*)
