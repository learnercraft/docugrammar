# *can* and *could* with *see*, *hear*, etc

## *see*, *hear*, *feel*, *smell*, *taste*

When these verbs refer to perception (receiving information through the eyes, ears, etc), we do not normally use progressive forms. To talk about seeing, hearing, etc at a particular moment, we often use **can see**, **can hear**, etc (especially in British English).

- *I **can see** Susan coming.* (not *~~I’m seeing …~~*)
- ***Can** you **hear** somebody coming up the stairs?*
- *What did you put in the stew? I **can taste** something funny.*
- *Suddenly she realised she **could smell** something burning.*

In American English, **I see/hear**, etc are common in this sense.

## *guess*, *tell*

*Can* and *could* are often used with *guess* and with *tell* (meaning *see*, *know*). *Can*/*could* are not normally used with *know* in the sense of ‘find out’ [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/know#know-and-find-out-etc).

- *I **could guess** what she wanted.*
- *You **can tell** he’s Irish from his accent.* (not *~~You can know …~~*)

## *understand*, *follow*, *remember*

*Can*/*could* is often used with these verbs too. It does not always add very much to the meaning.

- *I **can’t**/**don’t understand** what she’s talking about.*
- ***Do**/**Can** you **follow** what he’s saying?*
- *I (**can**) **remember** your grandfather.*
