# Chances: *may*, *might* and *could*

## *You may be right*; *We may go climbing.*

We often use *may*, *might* and *could* to talk about the chance (possibility) that something will happen, or is happening.

- *We **may** go climbing in the Alps next summer.*
- *‘I think Labour are going to win.’ ‘You **may** be right.’*
- *Daniel **might** phone. If he does, ask him to ring later.*
- *‘Where’s Emma?’ ‘I don’t know. She **might** be out running, I suppose.’*
- *They’ve agreed, but they **could** change their minds.*

*May well*, *might well* and *could well* suggest stronger possibilities.

- *‘I think it’s going to rain.’ ‘You **may well** be right – the sky’s really black.’*

*Can* is not normally used to talk about the chance that something will happen or is happening.

- *not *~~It can rain this afternoon.~~**
- *not *~~Emma can be out running.~~**

## *may*, *might* and *could*: the difference

*Might* and *could* are not often used as past forms of *may* and *can*: more often they are used to talk about the present or future. *Might* and *could* are less definite or more hesitant than *may*, suggesting a smaller chance – they are used when people think something is possible but not very likely. Compare:

- *I **may** go to London tomorrow.* (perhaps a 50% chance)
- *Joe **might** come with me.* (perhaps a 30% chance)

## Questions: *may* not used

*May* is not normally used to ask about the chance of something happening.

- ***Are** you **likely** to go camping this summer?* (not *~~May you go camping …?~~*)
- *Has Emma gone running, **I wonder**?* (not *~~May Emma have gone running?~~*)

But *may* is possible in indirect questions (for example after *Do you think*).

- ***Do you think** you **may** go camping this summer?*

*Might* can be used in direct questions, but this is rather formal.

- ***Might** you go camping?* (less natural than *Do you think you may/might …?*)

## Two negatives: *may/might not* and *can’t*

There are two ways to make *may/might* negative: with *may/might not* (= It is possible that … not …) and with *can’t* (= It is not possible that …). Compare:

- *She **may** be at home.* (= Perhaps she is at home.)  
  *She **may not** be at home.* (= Perhaps she is not at home.)  
  *She **can’t** be at home.* (= She is certainly not at home.)
- *You **might** win.* (= Perhaps you will win.)  
  *You **might not** win.* (= Perhaps you won’t win.)  
  *You **can’t** win.* (= You certainly won’t win.)

*Couldn’t* is possible with the same meaning as *can’t*, but is less common.

## *might* meaning ‘would perhaps’

*Might* and *could* (but not *may*) can have a conditional meaning (= would perhaps).

- *Don’t play with knives. You **might/could** get hurt.* (= Perhaps you would get hurt.)
- *If you went to bed for an hour, you **might** feel better.* (= … perhaps you would feel better.)

## Indirect speech: *might*/*could*

*Might*/*could* is used in past indirect speech when *may* was used in direct speech.

- *‘I **may** go to Scotland.’ ‘What?’ ‘I said I **might** go to Scotland.’*

## Past: *might*/*could* + infinitive not used

*Might*/*could* + infinitive is not normally used to talk about past possibility (except in indirect speech).

- *I felt very hot and tired. **Perhaps** I **was** ill.* (not *~~… I might be ill.~~*)
- but *I thought I **might** be ill.*

## *may/might/could have …*: *She may have missed her train.*

However, to say that it is possible that something happened or was true in the past, we can use *may/might/could have* + past participle.

- *‘Polly’s very late.’ ‘She **may have missed** her train.’* (= It is possible that she missed …)
- *‘What was that noise?’ ‘It **might/could have been** a cat.’*

*May/might have* … can sometimes refer to the present or future.

- *I’ll try phoning him, but he **may have gone** out by now.*
- *By the end of this year I **might have saved** some money.*

## *might/could have* …: *You might/could have killed yourself.*

To say that something was possible but did not happen, we can use *might/could have …*

- *You were stupid to try climbing up there. You **might/could have killed** yourself.*
- *If she hadn’t been so bad-tempered, I **might/could have married** her.*

*May have* … is now sometimes used with this meaning too; some people feel that this is not correct.

- *You were stupid to try climbing up there. You **may have killed** yourself.* (More normal: … *You *might/could have killed* yourself*.)

:::note

For *might/could have* … used to criticise people for not doing things, [(see here)](./instructions-and-requests-will-would-can-could-might-shall#criticisms-you-could-have-told-me).

## The difference between *may/might/could* and *should/ought to*

We use *should* and *ought to* to express a **deduction** that something is **probable**: they suggest that we have a good reason for this belief.

*May*, *might* and *could* simply say that something is **possible**, without suggesting that we have a good reason for thinking it is true or will happen. Compare:

- *Anna **should** be in the office now – it’s ten o’clock.*  
  *Dan **may** be in the office now – I don’t know what time he starts work.*
- *I’ve got all John’s keys here. One of them **ought to** open the safe.*  
  *Let’s ask Amy. She **might** know which is the right one. It’s worth a try.*
