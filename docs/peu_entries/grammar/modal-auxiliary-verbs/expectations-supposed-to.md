# Expectations: *supposed to*

*Be supposed* + infinitive is used to say what people have to do (or not do) according to the rules or the law, or to say what is (not) expected to happen.

- *Catholics **are supposed to go** to church on Sundays.*

There is often a suggestion that things do not happen as planned or expected.
