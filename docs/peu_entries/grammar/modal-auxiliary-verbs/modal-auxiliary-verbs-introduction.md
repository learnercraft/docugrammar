# Introduction

## What are modal auxiliary verbs?

The **modal auxiliary verbs** are *will*, *would*, *shall*, *should*, *can*, *could*, *ought*, *may*, *might* and *must*. Their grammar is different from that of other verbs: for example, they have no infinitives, participles or past tenses. For details, [(see here)](./modals-grammar-pronunciation-and-contractions#grammar). Some other verbs and expressions are used in similar ways to modals: *have to*, *be able to*, *be supposed to*, *had better* and *need*.

## Meanings

We do not usually use modal verbs to say that situations definitely exist, or that particular events have definitely happened. We use them, for example, to talk about things which we expect, which are or are not possible, which we think are necessary, which we want to happen, which we are not sure about, which tend to happen, or which have not happened. This is a complicated area of grammar: each modal verb has more than one use; on the other hand, different modals can have very similar uses. Modal meanings fall into four groups.

1. **degrees of certainty** ([(see here)](./deduction-deciding-that-something-is-certain-must-can-t-etc)

    Most modal verbs can be used to express degrees of certainty about facts, situations or events: for instance to say that something is certain, probable, possible or impossible.

    - *It **will** rain tomorrow.*
    - *She **should** be here soon.*
    - *We **may** get a new car.*
    - *It **can’t** be true.*

2. **obligation, freedom to act, etc** ([(see here)](./strong-obligation-must-will)

    Most modal verbs can also express various ideas relating to obligation, freedom to act, recommended behaviour, permission, willingness and similar matters. They are common in requests, suggestions, invitations and instructions.

    - *Students **must** register by 30 January.*
    - *You **should** see the doctor.*
    - *If you **will** come this way …*
    - ***Could** I talk to you for a moment?*

    Note that these meanings are usually expressed from the speaker’s point of view in statements, and from the hearer’s in questions. Compare:

    - *You **must** go and see Anna. (**I** think it is necessary.)*
    - ***Must** you go and see Anna? (Do **you** think it is necessary?)*

3. **ability** ([(see here)](./ability-can-and-could)

    Modal verbs, especially *can* and *could*, are used to say what people and things are able to do because of their knowledge, skill, design and so on.

    - *She **can** speak six languages.*
    - *My old car **could** do 120mph.*

4. **typical behaviour** ([(see here)](./typical-behaviour-can-could-may-might-will-would)

    We can talk about what people and things typically or habitually do or did, using *can*, *may*, *will*, *would* and *used to*.

    - *Dan **can** really get on your nerves.*
    - *Most evenings he’**ll** just sit watching TV.*
    - *A female crocodile **may** lay 30–40 eggs.*
    - *I **used to** play a lot of tennis.*
