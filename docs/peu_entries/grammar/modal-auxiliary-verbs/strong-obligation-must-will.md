# Strong obligation: *must*, *will*

The following explanations apply particularly to British English. Americans often use *have (got) to* where British people use *must* [(see here)](./have-got-to-and-must). However, this use of *have (got) to* is becoming more common in British English under American influence. And note that *must* is becoming less common in both British and American English.

## Statements: *I really must stop smoking.*

In affirmative statements, we can use *must* to say what is necessary, and to give strong advice and orders to ourselves or other people.

- *Plants **must** get enough light and water if they are to grow well.*
- *British industry **must** improve its productivity.*
- *I really **must** stop smoking.*
- *You **must** be here before eight o’clock tomorrow.*

*Must* is common in emphatic invitations.

- *You really **must** come and see us soon.*

## Questions: *Must I …?*

In questions, we use *must* to ask about what the hearer thinks is necessary.

- ***Must** I clean all the rooms?*
- *Why **must** you always bang the door?*

## Negatives: *You mustn’t/can’t …*

We use *must not / mustn’t* to say that it is wrong to do things, or to tell people not to do things. *Can’t* is also possible.

- *The government **mustn’t/can’t** expect people to work for no money.*
- *You **mustn’t/can’t** open this parcel until Christmas Day.*

## *mustn’t* and *needn’t / don’t have to*

*Mustn’t* is not used to say that things are unnecessary. This idea is expressed by ***needn’t*** (BrE), *don’t need to* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/need) or *don’t have to*.

- **You **needn’t** work tomorrow if you don’t want to.* (BrE) or You **don’t have to** work …* (not *~~You mustn’t … if you don’t want to.~~*)

- *You **don’t need to** get a visa to go to Scotland. or You **don’t have to** get a visa …* (not *~~You mustn’t get a visa to go to Scotland.~~*)

## Past necessity and obligation: *They had to work very hard.*

*Must* is not normally used to talk about past obligation (except in indirect speech – see below). This is because *must* is used mainly to influence people’s behaviour – for example through orders or advice – and one cannot do this in the past. *Had to* is used to talk about obligation that existed in the past.

- *I **had to** cycle three miles to school when I was a child.*
- *My parents **had to** work very hard to build up their business.*

Note the difference between *had to* + infinitive and *must have* + past participle. The structure with *must have* … is used to express certainty about the past [(see here)](./deduction-deciding-that-something-is-certain-must-can-t-etc). Compare:

- *Nadia isn’t in her office. She **had to** go home.* (= It was necessary for her to go home.)
- *Nadia isn’t in her office. She **must have gone** home.* (= It seems certain that she has gone home.)

## Orders with *will*: *Will you be quiet!*

We use *will you* to tell people what to do.

- ***Will you** send me the bill, please?*
- *Come this way, **will you**?*
- ***Will you** be quiet!*

*Will* can be used in affirmative structures to give impersonal, military-type orders.

- *All staff **will** submit weekly progress reports.*

## Indirect speech: *He said I must stop.*

*Must* can be used after a past reporting verb as if it were a past tense.

- *The doctor said that I **must** stop smoking.*

Obligation can also be reported with *had to* and *would have to*.

- *The doctor said that I **had to / would have to** stop smoking.*

## *must* and *should*

*Should* can be used as a weaker form of *must* [(see here)](./weaker-obligation-should-and-ought-to). Compare:

- *That carpet **must** be cleaned.* (= It is absolutely necessary.)
- *That carpet **should** be cleaned.* (= It would be a good idea.)
