## Only past

*Used to …* has no present form (and no progressive, perfect, infinitive or *\-ing* forms). To talk about present habits and states, we usually just use the simple present tense [(see here)](./../present-tenses/simple-present-use).

- *He **smokes**.* (not *~~He uses to smoke.~~*)
- *Her brother still **collects** stamps.*

## Questions and negatives

When questions and negatives are written, they often have *did … used* instead of *did … use*. Many people consider this incorrect.

- *What **did** people **use(d) to do** in the evenings before TV?*
- *I **didn’t use(d) to like** opera, but now I do.*

The contraction *usedn’t* is also possible, especially in British English.

- *I **usedn’t** to like opera.*

But the most common negative is *never used …*

- *I **never used** to like opera.*

In a formal style, questions and negatives without *do* are possible, but these are not very common, and are rare in American English.

- **I **used not to like** opera, but now I do.* (or I **used to not like** opera …)* (BrE)
- ****Used you to play** football at school?** (BrE)

These forms are not used in tags.

- *You used not to like him, **did you?*** (not *~~… used you?~~*)

## When *used to …* is not used

*Used to* refers to things that happened at an earlier stage of one’s life and are now finished: there is an idea that circumstances have changed. The structure is not used simply to say what happened at a particular past time, or how long it took, or how many times it happened.

- *I **worked** very hard last month.* (not *~~I used to work very hard last month.~~*)
- *I **lived** in Chester for three years.* (not *~~I used to live in Chester for three years.~~*)
- *I **went** to France seven times last year.* (not *~~I used to go to France seven times last year.~~*)

## Word order

Mid-position adverbials [(see here)](./../adverbs-and-adverbials/mid-position-details) can go before or after *used*. The position before *used* is more common in an informal style.

- *I **always used to be** afraid of dogs.* (informal)
- *I **used always to be** afraid of dogs.* (formal, and rare in AmE)

## Pronunciation

Note the pronunciation of *used* /juːst/ and *use* /juːs/ in this structure.

## *used* + infinitive and *be used to …ing*

*Used* + infinitive has a quite different meaning from *be used to …ing* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/be-used-to). Compare:

- *I **didn’t use to drive** a big car.* (= Once I didn’t drive a big car, but now I do.) (not *~~I wasn’t used to drive a big car.~~*)
- *I **wasn’t used to driving** a big car.* (= Driving a big car was a new and difficult experience – I hadn’t done it before.)

## *used to* and *would*

*Used to* and *would* can both refer to repeated actions and events in the past.

- *When she was old, she **used to** / **would** sit in the corner talking to herself for hours.*
- *Sometimes he **used to** / **would** bring me little presents without saying why.*

But only *used to* can refer to past states. Compare:

- *When we were children we **used to** / **would** go skating every winter.*
- *I **used to** have an old Rolls-Royce.* (but not *~~I would have an old Rolls-Royce.~~*)

And we use *used to*, not *would*, to talk about regular and important habitual behaviour.

- *Robert **used to** play a lot of football.* (not *~~Robert would play …~~*)
- *I **used to** smoke.* (not *~~I would smoke.~~*)
