# Weaker obligation: *should* and *ought to*

## Use

*Should* and *ought to* are very similar, and can often replace each other.

- *They **ought to** be more sensible, **shouldn’t** they?*

They are both used to talk about obligation and duty, to give and ask for advice, and to say what we think it is right for people to do. *Should* is much more frequent than *ought to*, especially in negatives and questions.

- *You **should**/**ought to** see ‘Daughter of the Moon’ – it’s a great film.*
- *You **shouldn’t** say things like that to Granny.*
- *Applications **should** be sent before December 30th.* (More polite than *Applications must be sent …*)
- *He **ought to** get a medal for living with her.*

In questions, *should* is used to ask for advice or instructions, like a less definite form of *shall* [(see here)](./instructions-and-requests-will-would-can-could-might-shall).

- ***Should** I go and see the police, do you think?*
- *What **should** we do?*

*Should* and *ought to* are not used in polite requests.

- ***Could** you move your head a bit? I can’t see.* (not *~~You should move …~~*)

## Past use: *should have …*

*Should* and *ought to* are not normally used to talk about past obligation. Instead, we can use, for example, *was/were supposed to* [(see here)](./expectations-supposed-to).

- *It was going to be a long day. I **was supposed to** clean the whole house.* (not *~~I should clean …~~*)

But *should/ought to have* + past participle can be used to talk about unfulfilled past obligations: things which weren’t done, or which may or may not have been done.

- *I **should have phoned** Ed this morning, but I forgot.*
- *Alice **ought to have spoken** to James, but I’m not sure she did.*

## *ought*: forms

After *ought*, we use the infinitive with *to* before other verbs. (This makes *ought* different from other modal auxiliary verbs.)

- *You ought **to see** a dentist.*

*To* is not used in question tags.

- *We ought to wake Ella, **oughtn’t we**?* (not *~~… oughtn’t we to?~~*)

Mid-position adverbials [(see here)](./../adverbs-and-adverbials/mid-position-details) can go before or after *ought*. The position before *ought* is more common in an informal style.

- *You **always ought** to count your change when you buy things.*
- *You **ought always** to count your change …* (more formal; rare in AmE)

In American English, interrogative and contracted negative forms of *ought to* are rare; *should* is generally used instead.

- *He ought to be here soon, **shouldn’t he**?*

In some English dialects, questions and negatives are made with *did* (e.g. *She didn’t ought to do that*), but this structure is not used in standard English.
