# Direct speech: reporting verbs and word order

## Informal spoken reports: *said*, *thought*

When we repeat people’s words or thoughts, we normally use *say* or *think*. They can go before sentences or at other natural breaks (e.g. between clauses or after discourse markers).

- *So I **said**, ‘What are you doing in our bedroom?’ ‘I’m sorry,’ he **said**, ‘I thought it was my room.’ Well, I **thought**, that’s funny, he’s got my handbag open. ‘If that’s the case,’ I **said**, ‘what are you doing with my handbag?’*

## Literary direct speech: *ask*, *exclaim*, *suggest …*

In novels, short stories, etc, a much wider variety of reporting verbs are used: for example *ask*, *exclaim*, *suggest*, *reply*, *cry*, *reflect*, *suppose*, *grunt*, *snarl*, *hiss*, *whisper*. And reporting verbs are often put before their subjects (‘inversion’, [(see here)](./../information-structure/inversion-full-verb-before-subject).

- *‘Is this Mr Rochester’s house?’ **asked Emma**.*
- *‘Great Heavens!’ **cried Celia**. ‘Is there no end to your wickedness? I implore you – leave me alone!’ ‘Never,’ **hissed the Duke** …*

Inversion is not normal with pronoun subjects.

- *‘You monster!’ **she screamed**.* (not *~~… screamed she.~~*)

In literary writing, reporting expressions often interrupt the normal flow of the sentences quoted.

- *‘Your information,’ **I replied**, ‘is out of date.’*

## I was like …

In recent years the structure *be like*, meaning ‘say’, has become common in informal speech as a reporting formula, especially when describing people’s attitudes.

- ***I was like**, ‘Why don’t you come out with us?’, and **she was like**, ‘OK, cool, what time?’*

Originally used mostly by young Americans, the structure is now common in the speech of many people of all ages in both Britain and North America.

- *I didn’t want to **be like** ,‘Please be quiet’.* (A university teacher talking about students chatting in lectures.)
