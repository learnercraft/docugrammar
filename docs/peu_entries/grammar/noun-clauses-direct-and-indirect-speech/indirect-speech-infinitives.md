# Indirect speech: infinitives

## *He promised to write.*

Speech relating to actions (e.g. promises, agreements, orders, offers, requests, advice and suggestions) is often reported with infinitives.

- *He promised **to write.***
- *She agreed **to wait** for me.*
- *Anna has offered **to babysit** tonight.*

Object + infinitive is common with *ask*, *advise*, *tell* and *order* (but not normally with *offer*).

- *I told **Andrew to be** careful.*
- *The landlady has asked **us to be** quiet after nine o’clock.*
- *I advise **you to think** again before you decide.*
- *The policeman told **me not to park** there.*
- but not *~~Anna has offered us to babysit tonight.~~*

## *He asked her how to* …

The structure question word + infinitive is common [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-other-uses/infinitives-after-question-words-who-to-etc). It often corresponds to a direct question with *should*.

- *He asked her **how to make** a white sauce.* (‘How should I make a white sauce?’)
- *Don’t tell me **what to do**.*
- *I’ve forgotten **where to put** the keys.*
- *I didn’t know **whether to laugh or cry**.*

## *suggest*, *say*: infinitives not used

We do not use infinitive structures after *suggest* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/suggest) or (usually) after *say*. However, after these and many other verbs, we can report instructions, etc with *that*\-clauses, usually with modal verbs.

- *I **suggested that he should try** a different approach.* (not *~~I suggested him to try …~~*)
- *The secretary **said that I mustn’t park** there.* (not *~~The secretary said me not to park there.~~*)
- *I told **Andrew that he ought to be** careful.*

Subjunctives [(see here)](./../conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/subjunctive-that-she-go-that-they-be-if-i-were-etc) and *\-ing* forms are also possible after some verbs, e.g. *suggest*. Subjunctives are particularly common in American English.

- *I **suggested that he try** a different approach.*
- *I **suggested trying** a different approach.*

:::note

For the structures that are possible after particular verbs, see a good dictionary.
