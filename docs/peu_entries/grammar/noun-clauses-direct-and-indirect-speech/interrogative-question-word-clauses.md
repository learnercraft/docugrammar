# Interrogative (question-word) clauses

Besides their use in indirect speech, clauses beginning with question words (*who*, *what*, *where*, etc) can act as subjects, complements or adverbials. This structure is often rather informal (especially with *how*\-clauses, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/how).

- ***Who you invite** is your business.*
- ***Where we stay** doesn’t matter.*
- *A hot bath is **what I need**.*
- *This is **how much I’ve done**.*
- *I’m surprised at **how fast she can run**.*
- *You can eat it **how you like**.* (very informal)

The ‘preparatory *it*’ structure is often used with subject clauses [(see here)](./../information-structure/preparatory-it-subject).

- ***It**’s your business **who you invite**.*
- ***It** doesn’t matter **where we stay**.*

For *who*, *which*, etc in relative clauses (e.g. *the woman **who teaches me Spanish***), [(see here)](./../relative-clauses/relatives-basic-information); for relative *what* (e.g. ***What she said** made me angry*), [(see here)](./../relative-clauses/what).
