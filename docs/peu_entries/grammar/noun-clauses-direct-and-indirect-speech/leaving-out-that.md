# Leaving out *that*

We can often leave out the conjunction *that*, especially in an informal style.

## Indirect speech: *He said (that) …*

*That* can be left out informally after many common reporting verbs.

- *James **said (that)** he was feeling better.*
- *I **thought (that)** you were in Ireland.*
- *The waiter **suggested (that)** we should go home.*

*That* cannot be dropped after certain verbs, especially verbs that are normally intransitive – e.g. *reply*, *email*, *shout*.

- *James **replied that** he was feeling better.* (not *~~James replied he was …~~*)
- *She **shouted that** she was busy.* (not *~~She shouted she was busy.~~*)

## After adjectives: *I’m glad you’re all right.*

We can leave out *that* in clauses after some common adjectives.

- *I’m **glad (that)** you’re all right.*
- *It’s **funny (that)** he hasn’t written.*
- *We were **surprised (that)** she came.*

## Not dropped after nouns

*That* is not usually dropped after nouns.

- *I did not believe his **claim that** he was ill.* (More natural than *… his claim he was ill.*)
- *He disagreed with Copernicus’ **view that** the earth went round the sun.* (not *~~… Copernicus’ view the earth went …~~*)

## Conjunctions

*That* can be left out in an informal style in some common two-word conjunctions, such as *so that*, *such … that*, *now that*, *providing that*, *provided that*, *supposing that*, *considering that*, *assuming that*.

- *Come in quietly **so (that)** she doesn’t hear you.*
- *I was having **such** a nice time **(that)** I didn’t want to leave.*
- *The garden looks nice **now (that)** we’ve got some flowers out.*
- *You can borrow it **provided (that)** you bring it back tomorrow.*
- ***Assuming (that)** nobody gets lost, we’ll all meet again here at six o’clock.*
