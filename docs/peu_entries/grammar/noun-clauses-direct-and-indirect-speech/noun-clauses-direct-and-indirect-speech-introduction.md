# Noun Clauses, Direct and Indirect Speech

introduction

## Uses of noun clauses

Clauses can act as subjects, objects or complements, just like noun phrases. Clauses used like this are called **‘noun clauses’**. Compare:

- ***The departure date** doesn’t matter.* (noun phrase subject)  
  ***When we leave** doesn’t matter.* (noun clause subject)
- *I told them **a lie**.* (noun phrase object)  
  *I told them **that I knew nothing about it**.* (noun clause object)
- *The main thing is **your happiness**.* (noun phrase complement)  
  *The main thing is **that you’re happy**.* (noun clause complement)

Noun clauses begin with *that* and with question-words like *when*, *where* or *who*. They are common in indirect speech, where they can also begin with *if* and *whether*.

## Direct and indirect speech

When we report people’s words, thoughts, beliefs, etc, we can give the exact words (more or less) that were said, or that we imagine were thought. This kind of structure is called ‘**direct speech**’ (though it is used for reporting thoughts as well as speech).

- *So he said, **‘I want to go home**,’ and just walked out.*
- *She asked, **‘What do you want?’***
- *And then I thought, **‘Does he really mean it?’***

We can also make somebody’s words or thoughts part of our own sentence, by using conjunctions with noun clauses, and changing pronouns, tenses and other words where necessary. This kind of structure is called **‘indirect speech’** or ‘reported speech’.

- *So he said that **he wanted to go home**, and just walked out.*
- *She asked **what I wanted**.*
- *And then I wondered **whether he really meant it**.*

These two structures cannot normally be mixed.

- *She said to me, **‘I’ve lost my keys’**.*
- *or She said to me **that she had lost her keys**.*
- (but not *~~She said to me that I have lost my keys.~~*)

## Rules for indirect speech

In many languages, indirect speech structures follow special rules and may have special tenses or verb forms. In English, the tenses in indirect speech are mostly the same as in other structures. Compare:

- *He **was** happy and he **didn’t want** to go home.*
- *He **said** he was happy and **didn’t want** to go home.*
- *He stayed out because he **was** happy and **didn’t want** to go home.*

So there is no need for learners to memorise complicated rules for the ‘sequence of tenses’ in indirect speech, or to practise converting direct speech to indirect speech. (Native speakers don’t do this when they are reporting what people say or think.) In a few cases tense use follows special rules: [(see here)](./indirect-speech-advanced-points).
