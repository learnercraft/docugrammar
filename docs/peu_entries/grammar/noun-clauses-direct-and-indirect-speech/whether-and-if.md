# whether and if

## Indirect questions

*Whether* and *if* can both introduce indirect questions.

- *I’m not sure **whether**/**if** I’ll have time.*
- *I asked **whether**/**if** she had any messages for me.*

After verbs that are more common in a formal style, *whether* is preferred.

- *We **discussed whether** we should close the shop.* (More normal than *We discussed if …*)

In a formal style, *whether* is usually preferred in a two-part question with *or*.

- *The Directors have not decided **whether** they will recommend a dividend **or** reinvest the profits.*

If an indirect question is fronted [(see here)](./../information-structure/fronting-this-question-we-have-already-discussed), *whether* is used.

- ***Whether I’ll have time** I’m not sure at the moment.*

## Prepositions

After prepositions, only *whether* is possible.

- *There was a big argument **about whether** we should move to a new house.* (not *~~… about if we should move …~~*)
- *I haven’t settled the question **of whether** I’ll go back home.*

## Infinitives

*Whether*, but not *if*, is used before *to*\-infinitives.

- *They can’t decide **whether to get** married now or wait.* (not *~~They can’t decide if to get married …~~*)

## Subject, complement and adverbial clauses

When a question-word clause is a subject or complement, *whether* is normally preferred.

- ***Whether we can stay** with my mother is another matter.* (subject)
- *The question is **whether the man can be trusted**.* (complement)

*The question is if …* is also possible, but less common.

- ***The question is if** the man can be trusted.*

## Not used in echo questions

*If* and *whether* are not normally used in ‘echo questions’ [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/echo-questions-she-s-invited-how-many).

- *‘Are you happy?’ ‘Am I happy? No!’* (not *~~… If/Whether I’m happy? …~~*)
