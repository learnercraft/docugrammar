# Countable and uncountable nouns: advanced points

## *20 square metres of wall*

Singular countable nouns are sometimes used as uncountables (e.g. with *much*, *enough*, *plenty of* or *a lot of*) in order to express the idea of amount.

- *There’s enough paint for 20 square metres of **wall**.*
- *I’ve got **too much nose** and **not enough chin**.*
- *If you buy one of these, you get **plenty of car** for your money.*

## *not much difference*

Some countable abstract nouns can be used uncountably after *little*, *much* and other determiners. Common examples are *difference*, *point*, *reason*, *idea*, *change*, *difficulty*, *chance* and *question*.

- *There’s **not much difference** between ‘begin’ and ‘start’.*
- *I don’t see **much point** in arguing about it.*
- *We have **little reason** to expect prices to fall.*
- *I haven’t got **much idea** of her plans.*
- *There isn’t **any change** in his condition.*
- *They had **little difficulty** in stealing the painting.*
- *Do you think we have **much chance** of catching the train?*
- *There’s **some question** of our getting a new Managing Director.*

Note the expression *have difficulty (in) …ing*.

- *I **have difficulty* (in) remembering** faces. (not *~~I have difficulties …~~*)

## *in all weathers*; *on your travels*

A few uncountable nouns have plural uses in fixed expressions.

- *He goes running **in all weathers**.*
- *Did you meet anybody exciting **on your travels**?*
- ***Gulliver’s Travels*** (novel by Jonathan Swift)

## *a/an* with uncountable nouns: *a first-class knowledge*

With certain uncountable nouns – especially nouns referring to human emotions and mental activity – we often use *a/an* when we are limiting their meaning in some way.

- *We need a secretary with **a first-class knowledge** of German.* (not *~~… with first-class knowledge of German.~~*)
- *She has always had **a deep distrust** of strangers.*
- *That child shows **a surprising understanding** of adult behaviour.*
- *My parents wanted me to have **a good education**.* (not *~~… to have good education.~~*)
- *You’ve been **a great help**.*
- *I need **a good sleep**.*

Note that these nouns cannot normally be used in the plural, and that most uncountable nouns cannot be used with *a/an* at all, even when they have an adjective.

- *My father enjoys **very good health**.* (not *~~… a very good health.~~*)
- *We’re having **terrible weather**.* (not *~~… a terrible weather.~~*)
- *He speaks **excellent English**.* (not *~~… an excellent English.~~*)
- *It’s **interesting work**.* (not *~~… an interesting work.~~*)
- *His speech did serious **damage** to his chances of election.* (not *~~… a serious damage …~~*)

## Plural uncountables: *the groceries*; *the customs*

Some uncountable nouns are plural. They have no singular forms with the same meaning, and cannot normally be used with numbers.

- *I’ve bought the **groceries**. (but not *~~… a grocery.~~*) or *~~… three groceries.~~**
- *The Dover **customs** have found a large shipment of cocaine.* (but not *~~The Dover custom has …~~*)
- *Many **thanks** for your help.* (but not *~~Much thank …~~*)
