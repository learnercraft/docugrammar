# Mixed singular and plural: other structures

In some complex structures, the same verb seems to belong with two different expressions, one singular and the other plural. And some noun phrases mix singular and plural elements.

## *one of the few women who have climbed Everest*

After expressions like *one of the …* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/one-of), singular and plural verbs are both used in relative clauses beginning *who*, *which* or *that*.

- *She’s **one of the few women** who **have**/**has** climbed Everest.*
- *This is **one of those books** that **are**/**is** read by everybody.*

Strictly speaking, a plural verb is correct (to agree with *the few women who* or *those books that*). However, singular verbs are also very common in these structures. More examples:

- ***One of the things** that really **make**/**makes** me angry is people who don’t answer emails.*
- *We’ve got **one of those Japanese cars** that never **break**/**breaks** down.*

## *A serious problem is wasps.*

In English a verb normally agrees with the subject of a sentence, not with a following complement.

However, if the subject is a long way from the verb, people sometimes make the verb agree with a complement.

![](/img/peu_img/peu529_2b.jpg)

This often happens, too, when the subject is a relative *what*\-clause, especially when the complement is long.

:::note

For singular and plural verbs after interrogative *what* and *who*, [(see here)](./mixed-singular-and-plural-other-structures#who-and-what).

:::

## Singular subject, plural continuation, plural verb

When a singular subject is modified by a following plural expression, people sometimes use a plural verb. This is not usually considered correct.

- *~~Nobody except his best friends like him.~~* (More correct: *Nobody … likes him.*)
- *~~A good knowledge of three languages are necessary for this job.~~* (More correct: *A good knowledge … is …*)

:::note

For singular or plural after *kind(s)*, *sort(s)*, *type(s)*, etc, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/sort-of-kind-of-and-type-of).

:::

## Co-ordinated subjects: *A and B*, *A or B*, *A as well as B*, etc

When two singular subjects are joined by *and*, the verb is normally plural.

- ***Alice and Joseph are** going to be late.*

But note that some phrases with *and* are treated like single ideas, and used with singular verbs [(see here)](./plural-expressions-with-singular-verbs#and).

- ***Bacon and eggs is** a popular British breakfast.*

When two subjects are joined by *as well as*, *together with* or a similar expression, the verb is usually singular if the first subject is singular.

- ***The Prime Minister, as well as** several Cabinet Ministers, **believes** in a tough financial policy.*
- ***The Managing Director, together with** his heads of department, **is** preparing a new budget.*

When two subjects are joined by *or*, the verb is usually singular if the second subject is singular, and plural if it is plural. Compare:

- *There’s no room – either two chairs **or a table has** got to be moved.*
- *There’s no room – either a table **or two chairs have** got to be moved.*

When two singular subjects are joined by *neither … nor*, the verb is normally singular in a formal style, but can be plural in an informal style.

- ***Neither** she **nor** her husband **has** arrived.* (formal)
- ***Neither** she **nor** her husband **have** arrived.* (informal)

## *who* and *what*

In a *who* or *what* question, if the answer is the subject of a clause, the verb with *who* or *what* is usually singular, even when the answer is plural.

- *‘**Who is** working tomorrow?’ ‘Jake, Lucy and Shareena* (are working tomorrow).’  (More natural than *Who are working tomorrow?*)
- ***Who was** at the party?* (More natural than *Who were at the party?*)
- *‘**What lives** in those little holes?’ ‘Rabbits* (do).’  (not *~~What live …~~*)

With verbs like *be*, where the answer to a *who* or *what* question is the complement of a clause, the verb with *who* or *what* can be plural.

- *‘**Who are** your closest friends?’ ‘(My closest friends are) Naomi and Bridget.’*
- *‘**What are** your politics?’ ‘(My politics are) extreme left-wing.’*

Relative *what*\-clauses are normally the subject of a singular verb.

- ***What she needs is** friends.* (More natural than *What she needs are friends.*)

However, plural verbs are often used before longer plural complements, especially if *what* is a long way from the verb.

- ***What we need** most of all **are some really new ideas**.*

## *here’s*, *there’s* and *where’s*

In an informal style, *here’s*, *there’s* and *where’s* are common with plural nouns.

- ***Here’s** your **keys**.*
- ***There’s** some **children** at the door.*
- ***Where’s** those **books** I lent you?*

## *another*, *a/an* + adjective

Plural expressions of quantity can be used with *another* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/other-s-and-another) and with *a/an* + adjective.

- *I want to stay for **another three weeks**.*
- *We’ll need **an extra ten pounds**.*
- *He’s been waiting for **a good two hours**.*
- *She spent **a happy ten minutes** looking through the photos.*
- *I’ve had **a very busy three days**.*

Note also the expression *a good many*/*few* + plural (informal).

- *I’ve lain awake **a good many nights** worrying about you.*
- *I bet that house could tell **a good few stories**.*

## *kind*, *sort* and *type*

In an informal style, we sometimes mix singular and plural forms when we use demonstratives with *kind*, *sort* or *type*. For details, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/sort-of-kind-of-and-type-of).

- *I don’t like **those kind of boots**.*

## *every* (frequency)

*Every* (which is normally used with singular nouns) can be used before plural expressions in measurements of frequency.

- *I go to Ireland **every six weeks**.*

## Fractions

Fractions between 1 and 2 are normally used with plural nouns [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/vocabulary-areas/numbers#before-nouns).

- *It weighs **one and a half tons**.* (not *~~… one and a half ton.~~*)
- *The tallest plants grow to about **1.75 feet**.*
