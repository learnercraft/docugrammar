# Introduction

**Nouns** are words like *house*, *team*, *idea*, *arrival*, *confusion*, *Canada*. Together (usually) with other words such as determiners or adjectives, they form **noun phrases**, which act as subjects, objects and complements in sentences.

- ***Our house** was miles from anywhere.*
- *Anna’s had **a great idea.***
- *The discussion left us in **considerable confusion**.*

Names of people, places, events, etc, (e.g. *Alice*, *Canada*, *Christmas*) are called **proper nouns**; they are grammatically different from other (**common**) **nouns** in some ways – for instance, they may not have articles [(see here)](./../determiners-a-an-and-the-my-your-etc-this-that-etc/more-about-the#superlatives-i-m-the-oldest).

## Countable/uncountable

English makes a distinction between **countable** and **uncountable** (or **mass**) nouns. Countable nouns (e.g. *horse*, *microphone*) are typically words for classes of separable things that can be counted; uncountable nouns (e.g. *water*, *oxygen*) are typically words for mass-like materials, substances, etc that can’t be separated into countable units. Countable nouns can be singular or plural (e.g. *horse, horses*); uncountable nouns are generally singular in form; and there are other grammatical differences between the two groups.

The countable-uncountable distinction is partly to do with the way things really are: clearly horses and microphones are separate objects, water and oxygen aren’t. But it is also partly to do with the way things are seen. Wool can be seen as a mass or as separate strands: English chooses to make *wool* uncountable. *Aggression* and *attack* express similar ideas, but the first is generally uncountable and the second countable.

## Possessive

Besides singular and plural forms, nouns can also have **possessive** forms (e.g. *horse’s*, *microphones’*).

## Agreement

1. Singular noun-phrase subjects are generally used with a special present-tense verb form (e.g. *works*, *goes*). For information about noun-verb agreement in some special cases, [(see here)](./singular-expressions-with-plural-verbs).

2. Some determiners (e.g. *an*, *each*, *many*, *much*) are only used with certain kinds of noun: singular, plural or uncountable. [*Determiners: a/an and the; my, your, etc; this, that, etc*](../determiners-a-an-and-the-my-your-etc-this-that-etc/determiners-a-an-and-the-my-your-etc-this-that-etc-introduction), [*Determiners: quantifiers*](../determiners-quantifiers/determiners-quantifiers-introduction) for details.

## Nouns in combination

English can put two or more nouns together in three ways:

- possessive noun + noun (e.g. *the **doctor’s secretary***)
- noun + noun (e.g. ***garden furniture***)
- noun + preposition + noun (e.g. *the **head of the department***).

This is a very complicated area of English grammar. General guidelines are given in entries [(see here)](./nouns-in-combination-my-father-s-house), but, unfortunately, there is no easy way to be quite sure which structure is used to express a particular compound idea. The most common expressions will be learnt by experience; in case of doubt a good dictionary will often show which form is correct or most natural.
