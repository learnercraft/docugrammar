# Nouns in combination: *milk chocolate*

## *milk chocolate*; *chocolate milk*

Many common ideas in English are expressed by noun + noun compounds. In this structure, the first noun modifies or describes the second, a little like an adjective. Compare:

- *milk chocolate* (a kind of chocolate)  
  *chocolate milk* (a kind of milk)
- *a horse race* (a kind of race)  
  *a race horse* (a kind of horse)
- *a garden flower* (a kind of flower)  
  *a flower garden* (a kind of garden)

Noun + noun expressions are often related to structures where the second noun becomes a subject.

- *an oil well* (the **well** produces oil)
- *a sheepdog* (the **dog** looks after sheep)
- *a Birmingham man* (the **man** comes from Birmingham)
- *the airport bus* (the **bus** goes to the airport)

## The first noun is singular: *a shoe shop*

Note that the first noun is usually singular in form, even if it has a plural meaning. (For exceptions, [(see here)](./nouns-in-combination-milk-chocolate#exceptions-first-noun-plural--a-clothes-shop).)

- *a **shoe** shop* (= a shop that sells shoes)
- *a **tooth**brush* (= a brush for teeth)
- *a **ticket** office* (= an office that sells tickets)
- *a **horse** race* (= a race for horses)
- ***coat** pockets* (= pockets in coats)

## Measurement: a five-litre can

Noun + noun is used in measurements, with a number before the first noun. The number is usually joined to the first noun by a hyphen (-). Note that the first noun is normally singular in form in these cases.

- *a **five-litre** can* (not *~~a five-litres can~~*)
- *a **ten-pound** note* (not *~~a ten-pounds note~~*)
- *a **hundred-dollar** bill*
- *a **five-day** course*
- *a **six-pound** chicken*
- *a **two-person** tent*
- *a **three-mile** walk*
- *ten **two-hour** lessons*

The number *one* is often left out.

- *a **(one-)pint** mug*

In fractions, the plural *\-s* is not usually dropped.

- *a **two-thirds** share* (not *~~a two-third share~~*)

Exception: *three quarters* *(a **three-quarter** length coat)*

## Exceptions: first noun plural – *a clothes shop*

Some nouns are plural in this structure, especially in British English. These include nouns which have no singular form*(like *clothes*), nouns which are not used in the singular with the same meaning (like *customs*), and some nouns which are more often used in the plural than in the singular (like *savings*). In some cases, e.g.*antique(s), *drug(s)*, usage is divided, and both singular and plural forms are found. In general, plurals are becoming more common in this structure. Examples:

- *a **clothes** shop*
- *a **glasses** case*
- *a **customs** officer*
- ***arms** control*
- *a **savings** account*
- *the **accounts** department*
- *the **sales** department*
- *the **outpatients** department* (of a hospital)
- *a **drinks** cabinet*
- **a **goods** train** (British English)
- *a **sports** car*
- *a **greeting(s)** card*
- *an **antique(s)** dealer/shop*
- *the **drug(s)** problem*
- *the **arrival(s)** hall* (at an airport)

Note also that singular nouns ending in *\-ics* can be used before other nouns.

- ***athletics** training*
- *an **economics** degree*

We use the plurals *men* and *women* to modify plural nouns when they have a ‘subject’ meaning; *man* and *woman* are used to express an ‘object’ meaning. Compare:

- ***men** drivers* (= men who drive)  
  ***women** pilots* (= women who fly planes)
- ***man**\-eaters* (= lions, tigers or other animals that eat people)  
  ***woman**\-haters* (= people who hate women)

## Articles

Articles belonging to the first (modifying) noun are dropped in noun + noun combinations.

- ***army** officers* (= officers in **the army**)
- *a **sun** hat* (= a hat that protects you against **the sun**)

## More than two nouns

More than two nouns can be put together. A group of two nouns can modify a third noun, these can modify a fourth, and so on.

- ***oil production** costs*
- ***road accident research** centre*

This kind of structure is very common in newspaper headlines [(see here)](./../written-texts/headlines) because it saves space.

- *``FURNITURE FACTORY PAY CUT PROTEST``*

## Pronunciation

Most noun + noun combinations have the main stress on the first noun.

- *a ˈbicycle factory*
- *a ˈfruit drink*
- *ˈski boots*
- *ˈcoffee beans*

However, there are quite a number of exceptions.

- *a garden ˈchair*
- *a fruit ˈpie*

The difference between noun modifiers and adjectival modifiers is sometimes shown by stress. Compare:

- *a ˈGerman teacher* (noun modifier: *a person who teaches German*)

- *a German ˈteacher* (adjective modifier: *a teacher who is German*)

To be sure of the stress on a particular combination, it is necessary to check in a good dictionary. Note that there are occasional British–American differences.

## Spelling

Some short common noun + noun combinations are generally written together like single words.

- *bathroom*
- *toothbrush*
- *seaside*

Other combinations are generally written separately (e.g. *furniture shop*, *railway station*). Sometimes usage varies (e.g. *lampshade* or *lamp shade*), but except with very short common combinations like *bathroom*, it is usually acceptable to write the two words separately. **Noun + noun** combinations often used to be written with hyphens (e.g. *spectacle-case*), but this is now unusual.

## Other structures

Not all compound ideas can be expressed by a noun + noun structure. Sometimes it is necessary to use a structure with *of* or another preposition; sometimes a structure with possessive *’s* is used.

- *a feeling **of disappointment*** (not *~~a disappointment feeling~~*)
- *letters **from home*** (not *~~home letters~~*)
- ***cow’s** milk* (not *~~cow milk~~*)
