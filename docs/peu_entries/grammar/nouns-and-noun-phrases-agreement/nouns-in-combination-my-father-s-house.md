# Nouns in combination: *my father’s house*

## Possessive ’s and other determiners

A possessive *’s* structure acts as a determiner [(*Determiners: a/an and the; my, your, etc; this, that, etc*)](../determiners-a-an-and-the-my-your-etc-this-that-etc/determiners-a-an-and-the-my-your-etc-this-that-etc-introduction) in a noun phrase. Compare:

- ***a** car*
- ***this** car*
- ***his** car*
- ***Jack’s** car*

A noun cannot normally have an article or other determiner with it as well as a possessive word [(see here)](./../determiners-a-an-and-the-my-your-etc-this-that-etc/possessive-determiners-my-your-etc#not-used-with-other-determiners). Definite articles are usually dropped when possessives are used.

- ***the car** that is Jack’s* = *Jack’s **car*** (not *~~the Jack’s car~~*) or *~~Jack’s the car~~*

But a possessive word may of course have its own article.

- *the car that is **the boss’s*** = ***the boss’s** car*

When we want to use a noun with *a/an* or *this/that*, etc as well as a possessive, we usually use the *of mine*, etc construction [(see here)](./../pronouns/a-friend-of-mine-etc).

- *She’s **a cousin of Jack’s**.* (not *~~… a Jack’s cousin.~~*)
- *I saw **that** stupid **boyfriend of Angie’s** yesterday.* (not *~~… that Angie’s stupid boyfriend …~~*)

## Meanings of the *’s* structure

We use the *’s* structure most often to talk about possessions, relationships and physical characteristics, especially when the first noun refers to a person or animal, or to a country, organisation or other group of living creatures.

- *That’s my **father’s** house.* (not *~~… the house of my father~~*)
- ***Emily’s** brother is a lawyer.* (not *~~The brother of Emily …~~*)
- *I don’t like **Alice’s** friends much.*
- ***Dan’s** eyes are like yours.*
- *There’s something wrong with the **cat’s** ear.*
- ***Scotland’s** climate is getting warmer.*
- *What do you think of the **company’s** management?*

We also use the structure to talk about things that people, etc produce.

- *I didn’t believe the **girl’s** story.*
- *Have you read **Jack’s** email?*
- *What are **Norway’s** main exports?*
- *The **government’s** decision was extremely unwise.*

With some words for people’s actions, we can use either *’s* or a structure with *of*.

- *the **Queen’s** arrival* ``OR`` *the arrival **of the Queen***
- *the **committee’s** second meeting* ``OR`` *the second meeting **of the committee***

An *of*\-structure is preferred when the ‘possessing’ expression is very long. Compare:

- *my **sister’s** husband*
- *the husband **of the woman who sent you those papers***

## *’s* not used: *the name of the street*

With nouns which are not the names of people, animals, countries, etc, *’s* is less common, and a structure with a preposition (usually *of*) is more normal.

- *the name **of the street*** (not *~~the street’s name~~*)
- *the back **of the room*** (not *~~the room’s back~~*)
- *the roof **of the house*** (not *~~the house’s roof~~*)
- *the top **of the page*** (not *~~the page’s top~~*)

However, both structures are possible in some expressions.

- *the **earth’s** gravity* ``OR`` *the gravity **of the earth***
- *the **plan’s** importance* ``OR`` *the importance **of the plan***
- *the **concerto’s** final movement* ``OR`` *the final movement **of the concerto***
- *the **train’s** arrival* ``OR`` *the arrival **of the train***
- *the **world’s** oldest mountains* ``OR`` *the oldest mountains **in the world*** (not *~~… of the world~~*), [(see here)](./../comparison/using-comparatives-and-superlatives#the-happiest-man-in-the-world)

Unfortunately, it is not possible to give useful general rules in this area: the choice of structure often depends on the particular expression.

## Like a subject

Note that the *’s* structure often corresponds to a sentence in which the first noun is the subject of *have* or some other verb.

- ***Joe’s** brother* (Joe **has** a brother)
- *the **dog’s** tail* (the dog **has** a tail)
- ***America’s** gold reserves* (America **has** gold reserves)
- *the **manager’s** decision* (the manager **made** a decision)
- ***Harris’s** novel* (Harris **wrote** a novel)

In a few cases, the first noun may correspond to the object of a verb.

- *the **prisoner’s** release* (they **released the prisoner**)

## Measurement of time: *a day’s journey*

The *’s* structure (or the plural with *s’*) is often used to say how long things last.

- *a **day’s** journey*
- ***twenty minutes’** delay*

Noun + noun structures are also possible in expressions with numbers [(see here)](./nouns-in-combination-milk-chocolate#measurement-a-five-litre-can).

- *a **three-hour** journey*
- *a **twenty-minute** delay*

## Other expressions of time: *yesterday’s news*

We can also use the *’s* structure to talk about particular moments and events.

- ***yesterday’s** news*
- ***last Sunday’s** match*
- ***tomorrow’s** weather*

## *worth*

Note the use of the *’s* structure before *worth*.

- *a **pound’s** worth of walnuts*
- ***three dollars’** worth of popcorn*

:::note

For the *’s* structure in compound nouns (e.g. *a doll’s house*, *cow’s milk*), [(see here)](./classifying-expressions-noun-noun-or-preposition-structure).

:::

## Possessive without a noun

We can use a possessive without a following noun, if the meaning is clear.

- *‘Whose is that?’ ‘**Daniel’s**.’*

We often talk about shops, companies, churches and people’s houses in this way. The apostrophe is often dropped in the names of shops and companies.

- *I bought it at **Smiths**.*
- *She got married at **St Joseph’s**.*
- *We had a nice time at **Jack and Susan’s** last night.*

In modern English, expressions like *the doctor*, *the dentist*, *the hairdresser*, *the butcher* are often used without *’s*.

- *Alice is at **the dentist(’s)**.*
