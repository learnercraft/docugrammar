# Piece- and group-words: a blade of grass; a bunch of flowers

## Uncountable nouns: pieces

To talk about a limited quantity of something we can use a word for a piece or unit, together with *of*, before an uncountable noun. The most general words of this kind are *piece* and *bit*. *Bit* (informal) suggests a small quantity.

- *a **piece**/**bit of** cake/bread*
- *some **pieces**/**bits of** paper/wood*
- *a **piece**/**bit of** news/information*

Other words are less general, and are used before particular nouns. Some common examples:

- *a **bar of** chocolate/soap*
- *a **blade of** grass*
- *a **drop of** water/oil/vinegar*
- *a **grain of** sand/salt/rice/corn/dust/truth*
- *an **item of** information/news/clothing/furniture*
- *a **length of** material*
- *a **loaf of** bread*
- *a **lump of** sugar/coal*
- *a **sheet of** paper/metal/plastic*
- *a **slice of** bread/cake/meat*
- *a **speck of** dust*
- *a **stick of** dynamite/chalk/celery*
- *a **strip of** cloth/tape/land*

## *not a … of …*

Some words for small pieces can be used in a negative structure meaning ‘no … at all’.

- *There’s **not a grain** of truth in what he says.*
- *There has**n’t** been **a breath** of air all day.*
- *We have**n’t** got **a scrap/bite** (of food) to eat.*
- *He came downstairs **without a stitch** of clothing on.*

## Pair

*Pair* is used for many things that normally go in twos, and with plural nouns that refer to some two-part objects [(see here)](./irregular-and-special-plurals#plurals-with-no-singular-forms).

- *a **pair** of shoes/boots/socks/earrings*
- *a **pair** of glasses/binoculars*
- *a **pair** of trousers / jeans / shorts / pyjamas / leggings / tights* (BrE) / *pantyhose* (AmE)
- *a **pair** of scissors/pliers/tweezers*

## Plural nouns: collections

Special words are used before certain plural nouns to talk about groups or collections.

- *a **bunch** of **flowers***
- *a **crowd** of **people***
- *a **flock** of **sheep**/**birds***
- *a **herd** of **cattle**/**goats***
- *a **pack** of **cards*** (AmE *a *deck* of cards*)

*Set* is used before many uncountable and plural nouns referring to groups which contain a fixed number of things.

- *a **set** of napkins / dishes / cutlery* (AmE *flatware* / *silverware*) / *spanners* (AmE *wrenches*)
