# Plural expressions with singular verbs

## Amounts and quantities: *that five pounds*

When we talk about amounts and quantities we usually use singular determiners, verbs and pronouns, even if the noun is plural.

- *Where **is that five pounds** I lent you?* (not *~~Where are those five pounds …?~~*)
- ***Twenty miles is** a long way to walk.*
- *‘We’ve only got **five cans** of juice left.’ ‘**That isn’t** enough.’*
- *More than **41 inches** of snow **has** fallen on the city this winter.*

## Calculations

Singular verbs are often possible after plural number subjects in spoken calculations.

- *Two and two **is**/**are** four.*
- *Ten times five **is** fifty.* (or *Ten fives **are** fifty.*)

:::note

:::

## *more than one*

*More than one* is generally used with a singular noun and verb.

- ***More than one person is** going to have to find a new job.*

## *one of …*

Expressions beginning *one of* normally have a plural noun and a singular verb.

- ***One of my friends is** getting married.* (not *~~One of my friends are …~~*)

:::note

For singular and plural verbs in relative clauses after *one of …*, [(see here)](./mixed-singular-and-plural-other-structures#one-of-the-few-women-who-have-climbed-everest).

:::

## *and*

Some expressions joined by *and* have singular determiners, verbs and pronouns [(see here)](./mixed-singular-and-plural-other-structures#co-ordinated-subjects-a-and-b-a-or-b-a-as-well-as-b-etc). This happens when the two nouns are used together so often that we think of them as a single idea.

- *This **gin and tonic isn’t** very strong, **is it?***
- *Your **toast and honey is** on the table.*

## Countries and organisations: *The United States is …*

Plural names of countries usually have singular verbs and pronouns.

- ***The United States is** anxious to improve **its** image in Latin America.*

Plural names of organisations may also have singular verbs and pronouns.

- ***Consolidated Fruitgrowers has** just taken over Universal Foodstores.*
