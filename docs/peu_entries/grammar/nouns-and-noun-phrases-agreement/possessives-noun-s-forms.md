# Possessives: noun + ’s (forms)

Forms like *John’s*, *parents’*, *children’s* are generally called ‘**possessive’**, although they express other ideas as well as possession.

## Spelling

| Rules | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| singular noun + ***’s*** | *my **father’s** car* |
| plural noun + ***’*** | *my **parents’** house* |
| irregular plural + ***’s*** | *the **children’s** room*, ***men’s** clothes*, ***women’s** rights*, *an old **people’s** home* |

We sometimes just add an apostrophe (’) to a singular noun ending in *\-s*, especially in literary and classical references.

- ***Socrates’** ideas*
- ***Dickens’** novels*

But *’s* is more common.

- ***Mr Lewis’s** dog*

We can add *’s* or *’* to a whole phrase.

- ***the man next door’s** wife*
- ***Henry the Eighth’s** six wives*
- ***the Smiths’** new house*

Note the difference between, for example:

- ***Joe and Anna’s** children* (one lot of children: Joe and Anna are their parents)
- ***Joe’s and Anna’s** children* (two separate lots of children: Joe’s and Anna’s)

## Pronunciation

The ending *’s* is pronounced just like a plural ending [(see here)](./pronunciation-of-plurals).

- *doctor’s* /ˈdɒktəz/
- *dog’s* /dɒgz/
- *president’s* /ˈprezɪdənts/
- *Jack’s* /dʒæks/
- *Alice’s* /ˈælɪsɪz/
- *Madge’s* /ˈmædʒɪz/
- *James’s* /ˈdʒeɪmzɪz/

The apostrophe in a word like *parents’* does not change the pronunciation at all. But with singular classical (ancient Greek and Roman) names ending in *s’*, we often pronounce a possessive *’s* even when it is not written.

- ***Socrates’*** /ˈsɒkrətiːzɪz/ *ideas.*
