# after: conjunction

:::tip[Grammar]

*after* + clause, + clause

:::

:::tip[Grammar]

clause + *after* + clause

## Use and position

*After* and its clause can come either before the main clause (often with a comma) or after. Putting it at the end can give it more importance in information structure [(see here)](./../information-structure/information-structure-normal-order-and-variations).

- ***After I moved to Scotland**, I changed jobs.*
- *I changed jobs **after I moved to Scotland**.*

Note the time relations: in both cases the speaker moved to Scotland first and then changed jobs. Compare:

- *I moved to Scotland **after I changed jobs**.* (The speaker changed jobs first.)

## Present with future meaning

We use *after* with a present tense to talk about the future [(see here)](./../conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/tense-simplification-in-subordinate-clauses).

- *I’ll telephone you **after I arrive**.* (not *~~… after I will arrive.~~*)

## Perfect tenses

In clauses with *after*, we often use present and past perfect tenses to show that one thing is completed before another starts [(see here)](./../past-and-perfect-tenses/past-perfect-advanced-points#past-perfect-or-simple-past-with-after-as-soon-as-etc).

- *I usually go straight home **after I’ve finished** work.*
- ***After Lara had finished school**, she went to America.*

We use a present perfect, not a future perfect, to talk about the future with *after*.

- *I’ll call you **after I’ve seen** Jake.* (not *~~… after I’ll have seen Jake.~~*)

## *after …ing*

In a formal style, we often use the structure *after* + *\-ing*.

- ***After completing this form**, give it to the secretary.*

*After having* + past participle is also possible when talking about the past.

- *He wrote his first book **after returning / having returned** from Mongolia.*
