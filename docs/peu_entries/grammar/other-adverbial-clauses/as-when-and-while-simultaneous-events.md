# as, when and while: simultaneous events

To talk about actions or situations that take place at the same time, we can use *as*, *when* or *while*. There are some differences.

## ‘backgrounds’: *as*, *when* or *while*

We can use all three words to introduce a longer ‘background’ action or situation, which is/was going on when something else happens/happened.

- ***As I was walking down the street** I saw Joe driving a Porsche.*
- *The telephone always rings **when you are having a bath**.*
- ***While they were playing cards**, somebody broke into the house.*

A progressive tense is usually used for the longer ‘background’ action or situation (*was walking*; *are having*; *were playing*). But *as* and *while* can be used with a simple tense, especially with a ‘state’ verb like *sit*, *lie*, or *grow*.

- ***As I sat** reading the paper, the door burst open.*

We can also describe situations like these by using *when* to introduce the shorter action or event. *As* and *while* cannot be used in this way.

- ***When** the telephone rang I was having a bath.* (not *~~As/While the telephone rang …~~*)
- ***When** the burglar broke into the house, they were playing cards.*

## Simultaneous long actions: *while*; *as*

We usually use *while* to say that two longer actions or situations go/went on at the same time. We can use progressive or simple tenses.

- ***While** you were reading the paper, I was working.*
- *Jack cooked supper **while** I watched TV.*

*As* is used (with simple tenses) to talk about two situations which develop or change together.

- ***As** I get older I get more optimistic.*

We prefer *when* to refer to ages and periods of life.

- ***When I was a child** we lived in London.* (not *~~As/While I was a child …~~*)
- *His parents died **when he was twelve**.* (not *~~… while he was twelve.~~*)

## Simultaneous short actions: *(just) as*; *(just) when*

We usually use *(just) as* to say that two short actions or events happen/happened at the same time.

- ***As** I opened my eyes I heard a strange voice.*
- *Emily always arrives **just as** I start work.*

*(Just) when* is also possible.

- *I thought of it **just when** you opened your mouth.*

## Future reference

As with other time conjunctions, we use present tenses with *as*, *when* and *while* when talking about the future.

- *As you **get** used to the work you’ll find it quite easy.*
- *I’ll wash some clothes while you’**re** out.*
- *We’ll feel a lot better when we’**re lying** on the beach next week.*

## Reduced clauses with *when* and *while*

It is often possible to leave out subject + *be* after *when* (especially when it means ‘whenever’), and after *while*. This is rather formal.

- *Don’t forget to signal **when turning** right.* (= … when you are turning right.)
- *Climb **when ready**.* (= … when you are ready.)
- ***While in Germany**, he got to know a family of musicians.* (= While he was …)
