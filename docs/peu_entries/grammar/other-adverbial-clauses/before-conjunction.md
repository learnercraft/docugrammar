# before: conjunction

:::tip[Grammar]

*before* + clause, + clause

:::tip[Grammar]

clause + *before* + clause

## Use and position

*Before* and its clause can come either before the main clause (often with a comma) or after. Putting it at the end can give it more importance in information structure [(see here)](./../information-structure/information-structure-normal-order-and-variations).

- ***Before I have breakfast**, I go for a walk.*
- *I go for a walk **before I have breakfast**.*

Note the time relations: in both cases the speaker goes for a walk first and then has breakfast. Compare:

- *I have breakfast **before I go for a walk**.* (The speaker has breakfast first.)

## Present or present perfect tense with future meaning

With *before*, we use a present or present perfect tense if the meaning is future [(see here)](./../conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/tense-simplification-in-subordinate-clauses).

- *I’ll telephone you **before I come**.* (not *~~… before I will come.~~*)
- *We can’t leave **before the speeches have finished**.*

## Perfect tenses

In clauses with *before*, we often use present perfect and past perfect tenses to emphasise the idea of completion.

- *You can’t go home **before** I’**ve signed** the report.* (= … before the moment when I have completed the report.)
- *He went out **before** I **had finished** my sentence.* (= … before the moment when I had completed my sentence.)

(Note that in sentences like the last, a past perfect tense can refer to a time *later* than the action of the main verb. This is unusual.)

## Before things that don’t happen

We sometimes use *before* to talk about things that don’t happen (because something stops them).

- *We’d better get out of here **before your father catches us**.*
- *She left **before I could ask** for her phone number.*

## *before …ing*

In a formal style, we often use the structure *before + -ing*.

- *Please turn out all the lights **before leaving the office**.*
- ***Before beginning the book**, she spent five years on research.*
