# Introduction

This Section deals with some conjunctions and clause structures which may cause grammatical problems for learners. Less problematic conjunctions (e.g. *because*, *although*, *until*) are included in [*Word problems from A to Z: Introduction*](../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/word-problems-from-a-to-z-introduction); search the Index for them.
