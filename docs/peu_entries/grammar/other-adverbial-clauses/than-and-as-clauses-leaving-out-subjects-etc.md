# than- and as-clauses: leaving out subjects, etc

## Subjects: *more than is necessary*; *as happened*

*Than* and *as* can take the place of subjects in clauses (rather like relative pronouns).

- *He worries more **than** is necessary.* (not *~~… more than it/what is necessary.~~*)
- *There were a lot of people at the exhibition – more **than came** last year.* (not *~~… more than they came last year.~~*)
- *The train might be late, **as happened** yesterday.* (not *~~… as it happened yesterday.~~*)
- *We’ve got food for as many people **as want** it.* (not *~~… as they want it.~~*)

Common expressions with *as* in place of a subject: *as follows*; *as was expected*; *as was agreed*; *as is well known*.

- *I have prepared a new plan, **as follows**.* (not *~~… as it follows.~~*)
- *They lost money, **as was expected**.* (not *~~… as it was expected.~~*)
- *I am sending you the bill, **as was agreed**.* (not *~~… as it was agreed.~~*)
- ***As is well known**, smoking is dangerous.* (not *~~As it is well known …~~*)

## Objects and complements: *as I did last year*

*Than* and *as* can also take the place of objects and complements.

- *They sent more vegetables **than I had ordered**.* (not *~~… than I had ordered them.~~*)
- *Don’t lose your passport, **as I did** last year.* (not *~~… as I did it last year.~~*)
- *She was more frightened **than I was**.* (not *~~… than I was it.~~*)
- *You’re as tired **as I am**.* (not *~~… as I am it.~~*)

Some English dialects use *what* after *as* and *than* in these cases.

- *They sent more paper **than what** I had ordered.* (non-standard)
- *You’re as tired **as what** I am.* (non-standard)
