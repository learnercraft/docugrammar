# *My suitcase is packed.*

Some verbs refer to actions that produce a finished result. Examples are *cut*, *build*, *pack*, *close*. Other verbs do not: for example *push*, *live*, *speak*, *hit*, *carry*. The past participles of finished-result verbs, and some of their passive tenses, can have two meanings. They can refer to the action, or they can describe the result (rather like adjectives). Compare:

- *The theatre **was closed** by the police on the orders of the mayor.* (refers to the action of closing)
- *When I got there I found that the theatre **was closed**.* (refers to the state of being shut – the result of the action)

Because of this, *be* + past participle can have a similar meaning to a present perfect passive.

- *The vegetables **are** all **cut up** – what shall I do now?* (= The vegetables have all been cut up …)
- *I got caught in the rain and my suit**’s ruined**.* (= … has been ruined.)
- *I think your ankle **is broken**.* (= … has been broken.)
- *My suitcase **is packed**.* (= … has been packed.)
