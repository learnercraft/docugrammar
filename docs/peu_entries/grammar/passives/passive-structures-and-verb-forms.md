# Passive structures and verb forms

## Passive verb forms

We normally make passive forms of a verb by using tenses of the auxiliary *be* followed by the past participle (= pp) of the verb. (For *get* as a passive auxiliary, [(see here)](./get-as-passive-auxiliary-he-got-caught).) Here is a list of all the passive forms of an ordinary English verb.

| Name | Construction | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| simple present | *am*/*are*/*is* + pp | *English **is spoken** here.* |
| present progressive | *am*/*are*/*is being* + pp | *Excuse the mess; the house **is being painted**.* |
| present perfect | *have/has been* + pp | ***Has** Emily **been told**?* |
| (simple) future | *will be* + pp | *You’**ll be told** soon enough.* |
| future perfect | *will have been* + pp | *Everything **will have been done** by Tuesday.* |
| simple past | *was*/*were* + pp | *I **wasn’t invited**, but I went.* |
| past progressive | *was*/*were being* + pp | *I felt as if I **was being watched**.* |
| past perfect | *had been* + pp | *I knew why I **had been chosen**.* |

Future progressive passives (*will be being* + pp) and perfect progressive passives (*has been being* + pp) are unusual.

Examples of passive infinitives: *(to) be taken*; *(to) have been invited*.

Examples of passive *\-ing* forms: *being watched*; *having been invited*.

Note that verbs made up of more than one word ( [(see here)](./../verbs/two-part-verbs-phrasal-verbs) can have passive forms if they are transitive.

- *The furniture **was broken up** for firewood.*
- *She likes **being looked at**.*
- *I need **to be taken care of**.*
- *He hates **being made a fool of**.*

## Use of tenses

Passive tenses are normally used in the same way as active tenses. So for example the present progressive passive is used, like the present progressive active, to talk about things that are going on at the time of speaking [(see here)](./../present-tenses/present-progressive).

- *The papers **are being prepared** now.*
- *The secretary **is preparing** the papers now.*

And the present perfect passive can be used, like the present perfect active, to talk about finished actions with present consequences [(see here)](./../past-and-perfect-tenses/present-perfect-basic-information).

- *Alex **has been arrested**!*
- *The police **have arrested** Alex!*

## Verbs not used in the passive

Not all verbs can have passive forms. Passive structures are impossible with intransitive verbs [(see here)](./../verbs/subjects-objects-and-complements#transitive-and-intransitive-verbs) like *die* or *arrive*, which cannot have objects, because there is nothing to become the subject of a passive sentence. Some transitive verbs, too, are seldom used in the passive. Most of these are ‘stative verbs’ (verbs which refer to states, not actions). Examples are *fit*, *have*, *lack*, *resemble*, *suit*.

- *They **have** a nice house.* (but not *~~A nice house is had by them.~~*)
- *My shoes **don’t fit** me.* (but not *~~I’m not fitted by my shoes.~~*)
- *Sylvia **resembles** a Greek goddess.* (but not *~~A Greek goddess is resembled by Sylvia.~~*)
- *Your mother **lacks** tact.* (but not *~~Tact is lacked by your mother.~~*)
- *She **was having** a bath.* (but not *~~A bath was being had by her.~~*)

## Confusing forms

Students often confuse active and passive verb forms in English. Typical mistakes:

- *~~I was very interesting in the lesson.~~*
- *~~We were questioning by the immigration officer.~~*
- *~~She has put in prison for life.~~*
- *~~These houses build in wood.~~*
- *~~We are write to each other in English.~~*
- *~~The play performed in the evening.~~*
- *~~This exhibition will be visit 5 million people.~~*

Mistakes like these are not surprising, because:

1. *Be* is used in both passive verb forms and active progressive tenses.
2. Past participles are used in both passive verb forms and active perfect tenses. Compare:

- *He **was** calling.* (active – past progressive)
- *He **was called**.* (passive – simple past)
- *He has **called**.* (active – present perfect)
