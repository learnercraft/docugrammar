# Introduction

## Active and passive structures

Compare:

- *They **built** this house in 1486.* (active)  
  *This house **was built** in 1486.* (passive)
- *Most Austrians **speak** German.* (active)  
  *German **is spoken** by most Austrians.* (passive)
- *A friend of ours **is repairing** the roof.* (active)  
  *The roof **is being repaired** by a friend of ours.* (passive)
- *This book **will change** your life.* (active)  
  *Your life **will be changed** by this book.* (passive)

When A does something to B, there are often two ways to talk about it. If we want A (the ‘doer’ or ‘agent’) to be the subject, we use an active verb: *built*, *speak*, *is repairing*, *will change*. If we want B (the ‘receiver’ of the action) to be the subject [(see here)](./when-do-we-use-passive-structures), we use a passive verb: *was built*, *is spoken*, *is being repaired*, *will be changed*.

The object of an active verb corresponds to the subject of a passive verb.

In most cases, the subject of an active verb is not expressed in the corresponding passive sentence. If it does have to be expressed, this usually happens in an expression with *by*; the noun is called the ‘agent’ [(see here)](./by-agent).

- *This house was built in 1486 **by Sir John Latton**.*

## Meaning and grammar

Meaning and grammar do not always go together. Not all active verbs have ‘active’ meanings; for instance, if you say that somebody *receives* something or *suffers*, you are really saying that something is done to him/her.

Some English active verbs might be translated by passive or reflexive verbs in certain other languages: e.g. *My shoes **are wearing out**; She **is sitting**; Suddenly the door **opened***. And some English passives might be translated by active or reflexive verbs: e.g. *I **was born** in 1956*; *English **is spoken** here*.

Some verbs can be used in both active and passive forms with similar meanings: for example *to worry / to be worried*; *to drown / to be drowned* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/drown). Sometimes active and passive infinitives can be used with very similar meanings: for example *There’s a lot of work to do / to be done* (for details, [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/active-and-passive-infinitive-with-similar-meaning). And some active verbs can have both active and passive meanings, for example *She **opened** the door* / *The door **opened*** [(see here)](./../verbs/verbs-with-both-active-and-passive-meanings).
