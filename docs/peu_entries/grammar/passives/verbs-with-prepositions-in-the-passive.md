# Verbs with prepositions in the passive

## *The plan has been looked at carefully.*

The objects of prepositional verbs can become subjects in passive structures.

- *We have looked **at the plan** carefully.* → ***The plan** has been looked at carefully.*
- *Nobody listens **to her**.* → ***She** is never listened to.*
- *Somebody has paid **for your meal**.* → ***Your meal** has been paid for.*

Note the word order. The preposition cannot be dropped.

- *I don’t like to be shouted **at**.* (not *~~I don’t like to be shouted.~~*)

:::note

For more about prepositions at the ends of clauses, [(see here)](./../prepositions/prepositions-at-the-ends-of-clauses).

:::

## *Stones were thrown at him.*

If there is already a direct object, the second object (after the preposition) cannot become a passive subject.

- *They threw **stones at him**.* → ***Stones** were thrown at him.* (but not *~~He was thrown stones at.~~*)
- *They stole **a bicycle from him**.* → ***A bicycle** was stolen from him.* (but not *~~He was stolen a bicycle from.~~*)
- *They poured **water on us**.* → ***Water** was poured on us.* (but not *~~We were poured water on.~~*)

Note that possessive nouns or pronouns cannot become passive subjects, either.

- *They called **Mr Archer’s name**.* → ***Mr Archer’s name** was called.* (but not *~~Mr Archer was name called.~~*)
- *I broke **her mirror**.* → ***Her mirror** was broken.* (but not *~~She was broken her mirror.~~*)

## *give*, *send*, etc

Verbs like *give*, *send*, *lend* can have two objects with no preposition (e.g. *They gave him a gold watch*). For the passive of this structure (e.g. *He was given a gold watch*, *A gold watch was given to him*), [(see here)](./verbs-with-two-objects-in-the-passive).

:::note

For structures with ***have* + object + past participle** (e.g. *We had water poured on us*), [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/causative-and-similar-structures-with-have), [(see here)](./../information-structure/information-structure-normal-order-and-variations#choosing-the-right-structure).
