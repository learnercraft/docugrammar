# Introduction

English has six different verb forms to refer to past events and situations. They are:

| Name | Example |
| --- | --- |
| simple past | *I worked* |
| past progressive (or ‘continuous’) | *I was working* |
| (simple) present perfect | *I have worked* |
| present perfect progressive (or ‘continuous’) | *I have been working* |
| (simple) past perfect | *I had worked* |
| past perfect progressive (or ‘continuous’) | *I had been working* |

In academic grammars, a distinction is often made between ‘**tense**’ (present or past) and ‘**aspect**’ (perfective and progressive). Tense shows time; aspect shows, for example, whether an event is seen as ongoing or completed at a particular time. In more practical books like this one, it is convenient to use ‘tense’ for all verb forms which show time.The various uses of these six verb forms are covered in the following entries. Note in particular that the English **present perfect** (e.g. *I have seen*) is **constructed** in the same way as a tense in some other Western European languages (e.g. *j’ai vu*, *ich habe gesehen*, *ho visto*, *jeg har set*), but that it is **not used** in exactly the same ways [(see here)](./present-perfect-or-past#finished-time-words-present-perfect-not-used).
