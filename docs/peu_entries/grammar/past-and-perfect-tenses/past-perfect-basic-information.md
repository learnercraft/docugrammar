## Meaning and use: earlier past

The basic meaning of the past perfect is ‘earlier past’. A common use is to ‘go back’ for a moment when we are already talking about the past, to make it clear that something had already happened at the time we are talking about.

- *During our conversation, I realised that we **had met** before.* (not *~~I realised that we met before~~* or *~~… have met before.~~*)
- *When I arrived at the party, Lucy **had** already **gone** home.* (not *~~… Lucy already went home.~~* or *~~… has already gone home.~~*)

The past perfect is common after past verbs of saying and thinking, to talk about things that had happened before the saying or thinking took place.

- *I **told** her that I **had finished**.* (not *~~… that I (have) finished.~~*)
- *I **wondered** who **had left** the door open.*
- *I **thought** I **had sent** the money a week before.*

## Past perfect not used

The past perfect is normally only used as described above. The past perfect is not used simply to say that something happened some time ago, or to give a past reason for a present situation.

- *Alex Cary, who **worked** for my father in the 1980s, is now living in Greece.* (not *~~Alex Cary, who had worked for my father …~~*)
- *I **left** a jacket to be cleaned. Is it ready yet?* (not *~~I had left a jacket …~~*)

## Unreal events: *if*, etc

After *if* [(see here)](./../if/unreal-past-situations), *wish* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/wish) and *would rather* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/rather-preference), the past perfect can be used to talk about past events that did not happen.

- ***If** I **had gone** to university I would have studied medicine.*
- *I **wish** you **had told** me the truth.*
- *I’**d rather** she **had asked** me before borrowing the car.*

## *how long?* past perfect, not simple past

We use a past perfect, not a simple past, to say how long something had continued up to a past moment. A simple past perfect is used with non-progressive verbs like *be*, *have* and *know*.

- *She told me that her father **had been** ill since Christmas.* (not *~~… that her father was ill since Christmas.~~*)
- *I was sorry to sell my car. I **had had** it since College.* (not *~~… I had it since College.~~*)
- *When they got married, they **had known** each other for 15 years.* (not *~~… they knew each other for 15 years.~~*)

With most other verbs, we use the past perfect progressive for this meaning [(see here)](./past-perfect-progressive).
