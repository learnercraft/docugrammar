# Past verb form with present or future meaning

A past tense does not always have a past meaning. In some kinds of sentence we can use verbs like *I had*, *you went* or *I was wondering* to talk about the present or future.

## After conjunctions, instead of *would*: *If I paid now …*

In most subordinate clauses (e.g. after *if*, *supposing*, *wherever*, *what*), we use past tenses (and not *would* …) to express ‘unreal’ or conditional ideas [(see here)](./../conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/tense-simplification-in-subordinate-clauses#past-instead-of-would).

- *If I **had** the money now I’d buy a car.*
- *If you **caught** the ten o’clock train tomorrow, you would be in Edinburgh by supper-time, unless the train **was** delayed, of course.*
- *Supposing we **didn’t go** abroad next year?*
- *Would you follow me wherever I **went**?*
- *In a perfect world, you would be able to say exactly what you **thought**.*
- *Ten o’clock – it’s time (that) you **went** home.* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/it-s-time)
- *Don’t come and see me today – I’d rather (that) you **came** tomorrow.* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/rather-preference#would-rather-past-tense-with-present-or-future-meaning)
- *I wish (that) I **had** a better memory.* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/wish#wish-that-clause-tenses)

## Distancing in questions, requests, etc: *I wondered if …*

We can make questions, requests and offers less direct (and so more polite) by using past tenses. (For more about ‘distancing’ of this kind, [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/politeness-distancing-verb-forms).) Common formulae are *I wondered*, *I thought*, *I hoped*, *did you want*. [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/politeness-distancing-verb-forms#past-tenses-how-much-did-you-want-to-spend).)

- *I **wondered** if you were free this evening.*
- ***I thought** you might like some flowers.*
- ***Did you want** cream with your coffee, sir?*

Past progressive forms (*I was thinking*/*wondering*/*hoping*, etc) make sentences even less direct. [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/politeness-distancing-verb-forms#progressives-i-m-hoping)

- ***I was thinking** about that idea of yours.*
- ***I was hoping** we could have dinner together.*

## ‘Past’ modals: *could*, *might*, *would*, *should*

The ‘past’ modal forms *could*, *might*, *would* and *should* usually have present or future reference; they are used as less direct, ‘distanced’ forms of *can*, *may*, *will* and *shall*. [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/politeness-distancing-verb-forms#modal-verbs-would-could-and-might)

- ***Could** you help me for a moment?*
- *I think it **might** rain soon.*

- ***Would** you come this way, please?*
- *Alice **should** be here soon.*

## Past focus on continuing situations: *It was such a nice place*

If we are talking about the past, we often use past tenses even for things which are still true and situations which still exist.

- *Are you deaf? I asked how old you **were**.*
- *I’m sorry we left Liverpool. It **was** such a nice place.*
- *Do you remember that nice couple we met in Greece? They **were** German, **weren’t** they?*
- *I got this job because I **was** a good driver.*
- *James applied to join the police last week, but he **wasn’t** tall enough.*
