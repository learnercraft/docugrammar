# Present perfect or past?

## Not thinking about the present

We use the present perfect if we are thinking about the past and present together. We do not use the present perfect if we are not thinking about the present. Compare:

- *My sister **has learnt** French.* (She can speak French now.)  
  *Shakespeare probably **learnt** Italian.* (not *~~Shakespeare has probably learnt Italian.~~*)
- *We’**ve studied** enough to pass the exam.* (The exam is still to come.)  
  *We **studied** enough to pass the exam.* (The exam is over.)
- *Anna and Daniel **have got** married!* (news)  
  *My parents **got** married in Canada.*
  
We do not use the present perfect in story-telling.

- *Once upon a time a beautiful princess **fell** in love with a poor farmer.* (not *~~… has fallen in love …~~*)

## Finished-time words: present perfect not used

We do not often use the present perfect with words that refer to a completely finished period of time, like *yesterday*, *last week*, *then*, *when*, *three years ago*, *in 1970*. This is because the present perfect focuses on the present, and words like these focus on the past, so they contradict each other. Compare:

- ***Have** you **seen** Lucy anywhere?*  
  *I **saw** Lucy **yesterday**.* (not *~~I have seen Lucy yesterday.~~*)
- *Tom **has hurt** his leg; he can’t walk.*  
  *Tom **hurt** his leg **last week.*** (not *~~Tom has hurt his leg last week.~~*)
- *What **have** you **done** with the car keys? I can’t find them.*  
  *What **did** you **do then**?* (not *~~What have you done then?~~*)
- *My brother **has had** an accident. He’s in hospital.*  
  ***When did** the accident **happen**?* (not *~~When has the accident happened?~~*)
- *All my friends **have moved** to London.*  
  *Sam **moved three years ago**.* (not *~~Sam has moved three years ago.~~*)
  
But with words that mean ‘at some/any time up to now’ (like *ever*, *before*, *never*, *yet*, *recently*, *already*), we normally use the present perfect [(see here)](./present-perfect-basic-information#repetition-up-to-now-i-ve-written-six-emails).

- ***Have** you **ever been** to Chicago?*
- *I’**ve seen** this film **before**.*

## Time not mentioned

We use the present perfect when we are thinking of a period of ‘time up to now’, even if we do not mention it.

- ***Have** you **seen** ‘Romeo and Juliet’?* (= `Have you ever seen it?` or `Have you seen the present production?`)
- *You’**ve done** a lot for me.* (… up to now)

On the other hand, we do not use the present perfect when we are thinking of a particular finished time, even if we do not mention it.

- ***Did** you **see** ‘Romeo and Juliet’?* (It was on TV last night.)
- *My grandfather **did** a lot for me.* (… when he was alive)

## News and details

We normally use the present perfect to announce news.

- ***Have** you **heard**? Andy **has won** a big prize!*

But when we give more details, we usually change to a past tense.

- *Joe **has passed** his exam! He **got** 87%.*
- *There **has been** a plane crash near Bristol. Witnesses say that there **was** an explosion as the aircraft **was taking off**, …*
- *The Prime Minister **has had** talks with President Kumani. During a three-hour meeting, they **discussed** the economic situation, and **agreed** on the need for closer trade links between the two countries.*
