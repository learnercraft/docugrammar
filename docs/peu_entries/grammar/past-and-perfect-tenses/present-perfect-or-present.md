# Present perfect or present?

## *how long?* present perfect

We use a present perfect to say how long a situation or action has continued up to now. Compare:

- *It’**s raining** again.*  
  *It’**s been raining** since Christmas.* (not *~~It’s raining since Christmas.~~*)
- ***Are** you **learning** English?*  
  *How long **have** you **been learning**?* (not *~~How long are you learning?~~*)
- *‘I hear you’**re working** at Smiths.’ ‘Yes, I’**ve been working** there for a month.’* (not *~~I’m working there for …~~*)  
- *I **know** her well.*  
  *I’**ve known** her for years.* (not *~~I know her for years.~~*)
- *My brother’**s** a doctor.*  
  *How long **has** he **been** a doctor?* (not *~~How long is he a doctor?~~*)
  
Compare also:

- *How long **are** you here for?* (= until when; when are you leaving?)
- *How long **have** you **been** here for?* (= since when; when did you arrive?)

## *This is the first time*, etc

We use a simple present perfect after *this is the first time that …* , *it’s the second … that …* , and similar structures [(see here)](./this-is-the-first-last-etc).

- *This is **the first time** that I’**ve heard** her sing.* (not *~~This is the first time that I hear her sing.~~*)
- *It’s **the fifth time** you’**ve asked** me the same question.*
- *This is only **the second** opera I’**ve ever** seen.*

For present perfect and simple present passives with similar meanings (e.g. *The shop has been / is closed*), [(see here)](./../passives/my-suitcase-is-packed).
