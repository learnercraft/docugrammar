# Present perfect simple or progressive?

## Non-progressive verbs

Some verbs are not used in progressive forms [(see here)](./../verbs/non-progressive-verbs), even if the meaning is one for which a progressive form is more suitable. Common examples are *be*, *have* and *know*.

- *Jack’**s been** ill all week.* (not *~~Jack’s been being ill …~~*)
- *She’**s had** a cold since Monday.* (not *~~She’s been having a cold …~~*)
- *I’**ve** only **known** her for two days.* (not *~~I’ve only been knowing her …~~*)

## Temporary or permanent

We use progressive forms mostly for shorter, temporary actions and situations. When we talk about longer-lasting or permanent situations we often prefer the simple present perfect. Compare:

- *I’**ve been playing** the piano all afternoon, and I’m really tired.*  
  *My grandmother **has played** the piano since she was a little girl.*
- *I **haven’t been working** very well recently.*  
  *He **hasn’t worked** for years.*
- *I’**ve been living** at Emma’s place for the last month.*  
  *My parents **have lived** in Bristol all their lives.*

Progressive and simple tenses are sometimes both possible, with a slight difference of emphasis.

- ***It’s been raining** / It’**s rained** steadily since last Saturday.*
- *Harry **has been working** / **has worked** in the same job for thirty years.*

We generally use the progressive to talk about continuous change or development, even if this is permanent.

- *Scientists believe that the universe **has been expanding** steadily since the beginning of time.*

## *how much?* *how often?* simple present perfect

We use the simple present perfect to say how much we have done, or how often we have done something. Compare:

- *I’**ve been planting**rose bushes all afternoon.*  
  *Look at all the rose bushes I’**ve planted**!* (not *~~… I’ve been planting.~~*)
- *We’**ve been painting** the house.*  
  *We’**ve painted** two rooms since lunchtime.* (not *~~We’ve been painting two rooms since lunchtime.~~*)
- *I’**ve been playing**a lot of tennis recently.*  
  *I’**ve played** tennis three times this week.*
