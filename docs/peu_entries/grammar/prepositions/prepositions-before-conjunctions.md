# Prepositions before conjunctions

Prepositions can be followed by conjunctions in some cases but not in others.

## Indirect speech: prepositions dropped before *that*

Prepositions are not used directly before the conjunction *that*. In indirect speech, after words that refer to saying, writing, thinking, etc, prepositions are usually dropped before *that*\-clauses. Compare:

- *I **knew about** his problems.*  
  *I **knew that** he had problems.* (not *~~I knew about that he had problems.~~*)
- *She had no **idea of** my state of mind.*  
  *She had no **idea that** I was unhappy.* (not *~~She had no idea of that I was unhappy.~~*)
- *I wasn’t **aware of** the time.*  
  *I wasn’t **aware that** it was so late.* (not *~~I wasn’t aware of that it was so late.~~*)

## Emotional reactions: prepositions dropped

Prepositions are also dropped before *that* after many common words that refer to emotional reactions. Compare:

- *We are **sorry about** the delay.*  
  *We are **sorry that** the train is late.* (not *~~… sorry about that the train is late.~~*)
- *I was **surprised at** her strength.*  
  *I was **surprised that** she was so strong.* (not *~~… surprised at that she was …~~*)

## *the fact that*

In other cases (not involving indirect speech or words referring to emotional reactions) prepositions cannot so often be dropped before *that*\-clauses. Instead, the expression *the fact* [(see here)](./../noun-clauses-direct-and-indirect-speech/that-clauses#the-fact-that) is generally put between the preposition and *that*.

- *The judge paid a lot of attention **to the fact that** the child was unhappy at home.* (not *~~The judge paid a lot of attention (to) that the child …~~*)
- *He said the parents were responsible **for the fact that** the child had run away.* (not *~~… responsible (for) that the child had run away.~~*)

## Question words

After some very common words like *tell*, *ask*, *depend*, *sure*, *idea*, *look*, prepositions can be dropped before *who*, *which*, *what*, *where*, *whether* and other question words. This is especially common in indirect questions. Compare:

- ***Tell** me **about** your trip.*  
  ***Tell** me **(about) where** you went.*
- *I **asked** her **about** her religious beliefs.*  
  *I **asked** her **whether** she believed in God.* (More natural than *I asked her about whether she believed in God.*)
- *We may be late – it **depends on** the traffic.*  
  *We may be late – it **depends (on) how** much traffic there is.*
- *I’m not **sure of** his method.*  
  *I’m not **sure how** he does it.* (More natural than *I’m not sure of how he does it.*)
- *I’ve no **idea of** the owner.*  
  *I’ve no **idea (of) who** owns it.*
- ***Look at** this.*  
  ***Look (at) what** I’ve got.*

In other cases it is unusual or impossible to leave out the preposition.

- *I’m **worried about where** she is.* (not *~~I’m worried where she is.~~*)
- *The police **questioned** me **about what** I’d seen.* (not *~~The police questioned me what I’d seen.~~*)
- *There’s the **question of who**’s going to pay.* (More natural than *… the question who’s going to pay.*)
- *People’s chances of getting jobs vary **according to whether** they live in the North or the South.* (not *~~… according whether …~~*)

*If* does not normally follow prepositions; we use *whether* [(see here)](./../noun-clauses-direct-and-indirect-speech/whether-and-if) instead.

- *I’m worried **about whether** you’re happy.* (not *~~I’m worried about if …~~*)

For the structures (with and without prepositions) that are possible after a particular verb, noun or adjective, see a good dictionary.
