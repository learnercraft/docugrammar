# Introduction

## Meanings and use

It is difficult to learn to use prepositions correctly in a foreign language. Most English prepositions have several different functions (for instance, one well-known dictionary lists fifteen main uses of *at*), and these may correspond to several different prepositions in another language. At the same time, different prepositions can have very similar uses (***in** the morning*, ***on** Monday morning*, ***at** night*). Many nouns, verbs and adjectives are normally followed by particular prepositions: we say *the reason **for***, *depend **on***, *angry **with** somebody*. Often the correct preposition cannot be guessed, and one has to learn the expression as a whole. In some expressions English has no preposition where one may be used in another language; in other expressions the opposite is true.

## Word order

In English, prepositions can come at the ends of clauses in certain structures, especially in an informal style. For details, [(see here)](./prepositions-at-the-ends-of-clauses).

- *What are you thinking **about**?*
- *She’s not very easy to talk **to**.*

## *-ing* forms

When we use verbs after prepositions, we use *\-ing* forms, not infinitives. For details, [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/ing-forms-after-prepositions-without-breaking-eggs), [(see here)](./ing-forms-and-infinitives).

- *She keeps fit **by going** to the gym.*

When *to* is a preposition, it is also followed by *\-ing* forms. [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/ing-forms-after-prepositions-without-breaking-eggs#to-as-a-preposition-i-look-forward-to-ing)

- *I look forward **to seeing** you soon.*

## Prepositions before conjunctions

Prepositions are sometimes dropped before conjunctions and sometimes not. For details, [(see here)](./prepositions-before-conjunctions).

- *I’m not certain **(of) what** I’m supposed to do.*
- *The question **(of) whether** they should turn back was never discussed.*

## Prepositions, adverb particles and conjunctions

Words like *on*, *off*, *up*, *down* can function both as prepositions and as adverb particles. For the difference, [(see here)](./../adverbs-and-adverbials/adverb-particles-up-down-back-away-etc). For verbs with prepositions and particles, [(see here)](./../verbs/two-part-verbs-phrasal-verbs).

- *She ran **up** the stairs.* (preposition)
- *She picked it **up**.* (adverb particle)

Some prepositions can also function as conjunctions: [(see here)](./../other-adverbial-clauses/after-conjunction) (*after*), [(see here)](./../other-adverbial-clauses/before-conjunction) (*before*) and [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/since-tenses) (*since*).
