# Present tenses: advanced points

## Repeated actions: simple or progressive?

The present progressive can refer to repeated actions and events, if these are happening around the moment of speaking.

- *Why **is** he **hitting** the dog?*
- *Jake’**s seeing** a lot of Felicity these days.*

We normally use the simple present for repeated actions and events which are not closely connected to the moment of speaking.

- *Water **boils** at 100° Celsius.* (not *~~Water is boiling at 100° Celsius.~~*)
- *I **go** to the mountains about twice a year.*

But we can use the present progressive for things that are going on around these actions and events.

- *At seven, when the mail **comes**, I’**m** usually **having** breakfast.*
- *You **look** lovely when you’**re smiling**.*

## Long-lasting changes

We use the present progressive for changes and developments, even if these are very long-lasting.

- *The climate **is getting** warmer.* (not *~~The climate gets warmer.~~*)
- *The universe **is expanding**, and has been since its beginning.*

## *I promise …*, etc

Sometimes we do things by saying special words (e.g. promising, agreeing). We usually use the simple present in these cases.

- *I **promise** never to smoke again.* (not *~~I’m promising …~~*)
- *I **swear** that I will tell the truth …*
- *I **agree**.* (not *~~I am agreeing.~~*)
- *He **denies** the accusation.* (not *~~He is denying …~~*)

## *I hear*, etc

The simple present is used with a perfect kind of meaning (= ‘I have learnt’) in introductory expressions like *I hear*, *I see*, *I gather*, *I understand* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/hear-see-etc-with-that-clause).

- *I **hear** you’re getting married.* (= ‘I have heard …’)
- *I **see** there’s been trouble down at the factory.*
- *I **gather** Daniel’s looking for a job.*

Other people’s statements, opinons, etc are often introduced with *says*.

- *It **says** in the paper that petrol’s going up again.*
- *No doubt you all remember what Hamlet **says** about suicide.*

## *Here comes …*, etc

Note the structures *here comes …* and *there goes …*

- ***Here comes** your husband.* (not *~~Here is coming …~~*)
- ***There goes** our bus.*

## *I feel / I’m feeling*

Verbs that refer to physical feelings (e.g. *feel*, *hurt*, *ache*) can often be used in simple or progressive tenses without much difference of meaning.

- *How **do** you **feel**?* or *How **are** you **feeling**?*
- *My head **aches**.* or *My head **is aching**.*

## Formal correspondence

Some fixed phrases that are used in letters, emails, etc can be expressed either in the simple present (more formal) or in the present progressive (less formal).

- *We **write** to advise you …* (Less formal: We *are writing* to let you know …)
- *I **enclose** a recent photograph.* (Less formal: I *am enclosing* …)
- *I **look forward** to hearing from you.* (Less formal: I’*m looking forward* to hearing …)
