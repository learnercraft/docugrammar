# Introduction

## The two present tenses

Most English verbs have two present tenses. Forms like *I wait*, *she thinks* are called ‘simple present’ or ‘present simple’; forms like *I am waiting* or *she’s thinking* are called ‘present progressive’ or ‘present continuous’.

## General time: simple present

When we talk about timeless truths, permanent situations or things that happen repeatedly, we usually use the simple present ([(see here)](./simple-present-forms) for details).

- *Water **freezes** at 0° Celsius.*
- *My parents **live** near Dover.*
- *I often **go** swimming.*

## Around now: present progressive

When we talk about temporary continuing actions and events, which are just going on now or around now, we usually use a present progressive tense [(see here)](./present-progressive).

- *‘What **are** you **doing**?’ ‘I’**m reading**.’*
- *I’**m travelling** a lot these days.*

## Future

Both present tenses can be used to talk about the future ([(see here)](./simple-present-use#talking-about-the-future), [(see here)](./../talking-about-the-future/present-progressive-for-future).

- *I’ll meet you when you **arrive**.*
- *Call me if you’**re passing** through London.*

## Terminology: tense and aspect

In academic grammars, the term ‘aspect’ is often used, for progressive forms. We use ‘tense’ for all verb forms which show time.
