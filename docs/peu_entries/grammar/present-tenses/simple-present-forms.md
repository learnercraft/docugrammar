## Pronunciation of third person singular forms

The pronunciation of the *-(e)s* ending depends on the sound that comes before it. The rules are the same as for the plural *-(e)s* ending, [(see here)](./../nouns-and-noun-phrases-agreement/pronunciation-of-plurals).

Irregular pronunciations: *says* (/sez/, not /seɪz/); *does* (/dʌz/, not /duːz/).
