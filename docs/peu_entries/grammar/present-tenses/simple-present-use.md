# Simple present: use

## General time: *It always rains in November.*

We often use the simple present to talk about timeless truths, permanent situations, or things that happen regularly, repeatedly or all the time.

- *What **do** frogs **eat**?* (not *~~What are frogs eating?~~*)
- *Alice **works** for an insurance company.*
- *It always **rains** here in November.*
- *I **play** tennis every Wednesday.*

![The graph of simple present for repeated actions.](/img/peu_img/sp_repeat.jpg)  

## Not used for things happening just around the present

We do not usually use the simple present to talk about temporary situations or actions that are only going on around the present. Compare:

- *Water **boils** at 100° Celsius.*  
  *The kettle’**s boiling** – shall I make tea?* (not *~~The kettle boils …~~*)
- *It usually **snows** in January.*  
  *Look – it’**s snowing**!* (not *~~Look – it snows!~~*)
- *I **play** tennis every Wednesday.*  
  *‘Where’s Bernard?’ ‘He’**s playing** tennis.’* (not *~~… He plays tennis.~~*)

## Non-progressive verbs

However, the simple present is used for this ‘around the present’ meaning with verbs that do not usually have progressive forms [(see here)](./../verbs/non-progressive-verbs).

- *I **like** this wine.* (not *~~I’m liking …~~*)
- *I **believe** you.* (not *~~I’m believing you.~~*)

## Talking about the future

We do not normally use the simple present to talk about the future.

- *I promise I **won’t smoke** any more.* (not *~~I promise I don’t smoke …~~*) [(see here)](./../modal-auxiliary-verbs/willingness-will-can#promises-and-threats-ill-phone-you-tonight)
- *We’**re going** to the theatre this evening.* (not *~~We go to the theatre this evening.~~*)
- *‘There’s the doorbell.’ ‘I’**ll get** it.’* (not *~~I get it.~~*) [(see here)](./../modal-auxiliary-verbs/willingness-will-can#announcing-decisions-ill-answer-it)

However, the simple present is used for ‘timetabled’ future events [(see here)](./../talking-about-the-future/simple-present-for-future#timetables-etc-the-summer-term-starts-).

- *His train **arrives** at 11.46.*
- *I **start** my new job tomorrow.*

And the simple present is often used instead of *will …* in subordinate clauses that refer to the future. (For details, [(see here)](./../conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/tense-simplification-in-subordinate-clauses).)

- *I’ll kill anybody who **touches** my things.* (not *~~… who will touch …~~*)
- *I’ll phone you when I **get** home.* (not *~~… when I’ll get home.~~*)

The simple present is also used in suggestions with *Why don’t you …?*

- *Why **don’t** you **take** a day off tomorrow?*

## Series of events: demonstrations, commentaries, instructions, stories

When we talk about a series of completed actions and events, we often use the simple present. This happens, for example, in demonstrations, commentaries, instructions and present-tense stories [(see here)](./stories-commentaries-and-instructions) for more details).

- *First I **take** a bowl and **break** two eggs into it.* (not *~~First I am taking …~~*)
- *Lydiard **passes** to Taylor, Taylor **shoots** – and it’s a goal!*
- *‘How **do** I **get** to the station?’ ‘You **go** straight on until you **come** to the traffic lights, then you **turn** left, ….’*
- *So I **go** into the office, and I **see** this man, and he **says** to me …*

## *how long?* present tenses not used

We use a perfect tense, not a present tense, to say how long a present action or situation has been going on. [(see here)](./../past-and-perfect-tenses/present-perfect-or-present) for details.)

- *I’**ve known** her since 1990.* (not *~~I know her since 1990.~~*)
