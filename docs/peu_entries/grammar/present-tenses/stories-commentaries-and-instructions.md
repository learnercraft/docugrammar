# Stories, commentaries and instructions

## Stories

Present tenses are often used informally to tell stories. The simple present is used for the events – the things that happen one after another. The present progressive is used for ‘background’ – things that are already happening when the story starts, or that continue through the story. (This is like the difference between the simple past and past progressive. [(see here)](./../past-and-perfect-tenses/past-progressive#past-progressive-and-simple-past-background-events)

- *So I **open** the door, and I **look** out into the garden, and I **see** this man. He’**s wearing** pyjamas and a policeman’s helmet. ‘Hello,’ he **says** …*
- *There’**s** this Scotsman, and he’**s walking** through the jungle when he **meets** a gorilla. And the gorilla’**s eating** a snake sandwich. So the Scotsman **asks** …*

The simple present is common in summaries of plays, stories, etc.

- *In Act I, Hamlet **sees** the ghost of his father. The ghost **tells** him …*
- *Chapter 2: Henry **goes** to Scotland and **meets** the Loch Ness Monster.*

## Commentaries

In commentaries, the use of tenses is similar. The simple present is used for the quicker actions and events (which are finished before the sentences that describe them); the present progressive is used for longer actions and situations. There are more simple and fewer progressive tenses in a football commentary, for instance, than in a commentary on a boat race.

- *Smith **passes** to Devaney, Devaney to Barnes – and Harris **intercepts** … Harris **passes** back to Simms, nice ball – and Simms **shoots**!*
- *Oxford **are pulling** slightly ahead of Cambridge now; they’**re rowing** with a beautiful rhythm; Cambridge **are looking** a little disorganised …*

## Instructions and demonstrations

We often use the two present tenses in a similar way to give instructions, demonstrations and directions.

- *OK, let’s go over it again. You **wait** outside the bank until the manager **arrives**. Then you **radio** Louie, who’**s waiting** round the corner, and he **drives** round to the front entrance. You and Louie **grab** the manager …*
- *First I **put** a lump of butter into a frying pan and **light** the gas; then while the butter’**s melting** I **break** three eggs into a bowl, like this …*
