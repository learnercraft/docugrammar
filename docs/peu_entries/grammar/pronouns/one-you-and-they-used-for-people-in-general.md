# one, you and they: used for people in general

## *one* and *you*: meaning

We can use *one* or *you* to talk about people in general, including the speaker and hearer.

- ***One/You** cannot learn a language in six weeks.*
- ***One/You** should never give people advice.*

## *one* and *you*: formality and class

*One* is more formal than *you* (and more common in writing than in speech). Compare:

- *If **you** want to make people angry, **you** just have to tell them the truth.*
- *If **one** wishes to make oneself thoroughly unpopular, **one** has merely to tell people the truth.*

*One* is often considered typical of more upper-class and intellectual usage, and is avoided by many people for this reason. It is less common in American English than in British English.

## *one* and *you*: only used in generalisations

*One* and *you* are only used in this way in very general statements, when we are talking about ‘anyone, at any time’. Compare:

- ***One**/**You** can usually find people who speak English in Sweden.*  
  *English is spoken in this shop.* ``or`` *They speak English in this shop.* (not *~~One speaks English …~~* – the meaning is not ‘people in general’)
- ***One/You** should knock before going into somebody’s room.*  
  *Somebody’s knocking at the door.* (not *~~One is knocking …~~*)
- *It can take **you/one** ages to get served in this pub.*  
  *Thanks, I’m being served.* (not *~~Thanks, one is serving me.~~*)

*One* generally has a singular meaning: ‘any individual’; it is not used to refer to whole groups.

- ***We** speak a strange dialect where I come from.* (not *~~One speaks a strange dialect where I come from.~~*)

## People including the speaker/hearer

*One* is not used for people who could not include the speaker; *you* is not used for people who could not include the hearer. Compare:

- ***One/You** must believe in something.*
- *In the sixteenth century **people** believed in witches.* (not *~~… one/you believed in witches~~* – this could not include the speaker or hearer.)

## *one/you* as subject, object, etc

*One* can be a subject or object; there is a possessive *one’s* and a reflexive pronoun *oneself*.

- *He talks to **one** like a teacher.*
- ***One’s** family can be very difficult.*
- ***One** should always give **oneself** plenty of time to pack.*

*You/your/yourself* can be used in similar ways.

British English uses *one*/*one’s* for a reference back.

- ***One** should always try to keep **one’s** temper.*

American English generally avoids this, traditionally preferring *he*/*him*/*his*.

- ***One** should always try to keep **his** temper.*

However, the use of *he*/*him*/*his* for people in general is now seen as sexist and also avoided [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/vocabulary-areas/gender-references-to-males-and-females#he-or-she).

## *they*

*They* has a rather different, less general kind of meaning than *one* and *you*. It usually refers to a particular but rather vague group (for example the neighbours, the people around, the authorities).

- ***They** don’t like strangers round here.*
- ***They**’re going to widen the road soon.*
- *I bet **they** put taxes up next year.*

Note also the common expression *they say* (= people say).

- ***They say** her husband’s been seeing that Smith woman again.* (not *~~One says …~~*)
