# Personal pronouns: advanced points

## *Jack and me went*; *between you and I*; *us women understand*

We often use object forms in coordinated subjects in informal speech and writing. And *I* is often used informally in coordinated objects. Some authentic examples from speakers of standard British English:

- ***Jack and them** are going skiing this weekend.*
- ***Me and Clio** will be coming to see you and Mum on Sunday.*
- *Between **you and I**, I think his marriage is in trouble.*
- *Really nice picture of **Josh and I** taken at the weekend by my friend Joe.*
- *Thanks, Andrew – Feb. 23rd is good for both **Jack and I**.*
- *I often think of the old days and how you helped **Bertie and I**.* (letter from Elizabeth, wife of the future King George VI, to King Edward VIII).

*Us* is sometimes used as a subject together with a noun.

- ***Us women** understand these things better than you men.*

These structures are often condemned as ‘incorrect’, but they have been common in educated speech for centuries. (There are examples of *me* in coordinated subjects in Jane Austen’s novels, written around 1800.) They are, however, restricted to an informal style. They are not considered correct in formal speech or writing.

## *as*, *than*, *but* and *except* + *me* or *I*

After *as* and *than*, object forms are generally used in an informal style.

- *My sister’s nearly as tall **as me**.*
- *I can run faster **than her**.*

In a more formal style, subject forms are used, usually followed by verbs.

- *My sister’s nearly as tall **as I am**.*
- *I can run faster **than she can**.*

*But* (meaning ‘except’) and *except* are normally followed by object forms ( [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/but-meaning-except), [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/except-and-except-for).

- *Everybody **except him** can come.* (not *~~Everybody except he can come.~~*)
- *Nobody **but me** knew the answer.*

## *It is*/*was me that …* / *I who …*

When a relative clause comes after an expression like *It is/was me/I*, there are two possibilities:

:::tip[Grammar]

object form + *that* (very informal)

:::

- ***It’s me that** needs your help.*
- ***It was him that** told the police.*

:::tip[Grammar]

subject form + *who* (very formal)

:::

- ***It is I who** need your help.*
- ***It was he who** told the police.*

We can avoid being too formal or too informal by using a different structure.

- *He was the person / the one who told the police.*

## Mixed subject and object: *It’s for him to decide.*

Sometimes a pronoun can be seen as the object of a verb or preposition, but the subject of a following infinitive or clause. Normally an object form is used in this case.

- *It’s for **him** to decide.* (not *~~It’s for he to decide.~~*)
- *I think it’s a good idea for **you and me** to meet soon.* (Considered more correct than *… for you and I to meet soon.*)
- *Everything comes to **him** who waits.* (Considered more correct than *… to he who waits.*)

## Inclusive and exclusive *we*

Note that *we* and *us* can include or exclude the listener or reader. Compare:

- *Shall **we** go and have a drink?* (*We* includes the listener.)
- ***We**’re going for a drink. Would you like to come with **us**?* (*We* and *us* exclude the listener.)

## *us* meaning ‘me’

In very informal British speech, *us* is quite often used instead of *me* (especially as an indirect object).

- *Give **us** a kiss, love.*

## *Poor you!*

*You* can be modified by adjectives in a few informal expressions such as *Poor/Clever/Lucky (old) *you!** (This occasionally happens also with *me*.)

## *you*: different singular and plural forms

Although standard modern English uses *you* for both singular and plural, separate forms exist in certain varieties of English. Some speakers in Yorkshire use *thu* or *tha* as a singular subject form and *thee* as a singular object form. Some British dialects have a separate plural form *ye*, *youse* or *yiz*. Many Americans (and increasingly, British people) use *you folks* or *you guys* (to both men and women) as an informal second person plural.

- *Hi, **you guys**. Listen to this.*

In southern US speech there is a second person plural form *you all* (pronounced *y’all*), used instead of *you* when people wish to sound friendly or intimate; there is also a possessive *you all’s* (pronounced *y’all’s*).

- *Hi, everybody. How’re *you all* doing? What are *you all’s* plans for Thanksgiving?*

:::note

For the older English forms *thee* and *thou*, [(see here)](./../varieties-of-english/changes-in-english#older-english-verb-forms-tell-me-what-thou-knowest).

:::

## *he*/*she who …*

The structure *he*/*she who …* (meaning ‘the person who …’) is found in older literature.

- ***He who** hesitates is sometimes lost.*

But this is very unusual in modern English.

- ***The person who** leaves last should lock the door. or **Whoever** leaves last …* (not *~~He/She who leaves last …~~*)

## Politeness

It is considered polite to use names or noun phrases, rather than *he*, *she* or *they*, to refer to people who are present.

- *‘**Dad** said I could go out.’ ‘No, I didn’t.’* (More polite than *He said I could go out.*)

- ***This lady** needs an ambulance.*

However, pronouns need to be used to avoid repetition [(see here)](./../written-texts/repetition).

- *Dad said **he** didn’t mind …* (not *~~Dad said Dad didn’t mind …~~*)

It is considered polite to mention oneself last in double subjects or objects.

- *Why don’t **you and I** go away for the weekend?* (not *~~Why don’t I and you …?~~*)
- *The invitation was for **Tracy and me**.* (More polite than *… for me and Tracy.*)

## Leaving out personal pronouns

Personal pronouns cannot usually be left out [(see here)](./personal-pronouns-basic-information#personal-pronouns-cannot-be-left-out).

- *She loved the picture because **it** reminded her of home.* (not *~~… because reminded her of home.~~*)

However, in informal speech, subject pronouns and/or auxiliary verbs are sometimes left out at the beginning of a sentence. For details of this, [(see here)](./../information-structure/ellipsis-at-the-beginning-of-a-sentence).

- ***Can’t** help you, I’m afraid.* (= I can’t …)
- ***Seen** Oliver?* (= Have you seen Oliver?)

We seldom put *it* after *know* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/know#i-know-and-i-know-it) for details).

- *‘It’s getting late.’ ‘I **know**.’* (not *~~I know it.~~*)

After certain verbs (e.g. *believe*, *think*, *suppose*), we use *so* rather than *it*. (For details, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/so-and-not-with-hope-believe-etc).)

- *‘Is that the manager?’ ‘I **believe so**.’* (not *~~… I believe (it).~~*)

And in British English, personal pronouns can be dropped after prepositions in descriptive structures with *have* and *with*.

- *All the trees have got blossom **on (them)**.*
- *He was carrying a box with cups **in (it)**.*

Object pronouns are not normally used in infinitive clauses if the object of the infinitive has just been mentioned [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/infinitives-after-adjectives-pleased-to-see-you#easy-to-please).

- *She’s easy **to please**.* (not *~~She’s easy to please her.~~*)
- *The pie looked too nice **to eat**.* (not *~~… too nice to eat it.~~*)
- *The bridge wasn’t strong enough **to drive over**.* (not *~~… to drive over it.~~*)
- *This dish takes two hours **to prepare**.*
