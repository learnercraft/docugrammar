# Personal pronouns: basic information

## Terminology and use

The words *I*, *me*, *you*, *he*, *him*, *she*, *her*, *it*, *we*, *us*, *they* and *them* are usually called ‘personal pronouns’. (This is a misleading name: *it*, *they* and *them* refer to things as well as people.)

Personal pronouns are used when more exact noun phrases are not necessary.

- ***I**’m tired.* (*I* replaces the name of any speaker.)
- *Jack’s ill. **He**’ll be away for a few days.* (not *~~… Jack’ll be away …~~*)
- *Tell Emily I miss **her**.* (not *~~Tell Emily I miss Emily.~~*)

## Subject and object forms: *I* and *me*, *he* and *him*, etc

Personal pronouns (except *you* and *it*) have one form when they are used as subjects, and a different form for other uses – for example, when they are the objects of verbs or prepositions.

| Subject | Object |
| --- | --- |
| I | me |
| he | him |
| she | her |
| we | us |
| they | them |

Compare:

- ***I** like dogs.*  
  *Dogs don’t like **me**.*
- ***We** sent **her** some flowers.*  
  ***She** sent **us** some flowers.*

## Other uses of object forms: *It was her*

*Me*, *him*, *her*, *us* and *them* are used not only as objects, but also as complements after *be*, and in short answers, especially in an informal style.

- *‘Who said that?’ ‘(It was) **her**.’*
- *‘Who’s there?’ ‘**Me**.’*

In a more formal style, we use subject form + verb where possible.

- *‘Who said that?’ ‘**She did**.’* (but not *~~She.~~*)

It is possible to use a subject form alone after *be* (e.g. *It is **I***; *It was **he***), but this is extremely formal, and is usually considered over-correct.

Object forms are also common in coordinated subjects in informal speech.

- ***Jack and me** are going skiing this weekend.*

This is considered incorrect in more formal usage [(see here)](./personal-pronouns-advanced-points#jack-and-me-went-between-you-and-i-us-women-understand).

:::note

For sentences like *It’s me that needs help*, [(see here)](./personal-pronouns-advanced-points#it-is-was-me-that-i-who).

## Personal pronouns cannot be left out

We cannot normally leave out personal pronouns, even if the meaning is clear without them (for some exceptions [(see here)](./personal-pronouns-advanced-points#leaving-out-personal-pronouns).

- ***It**’s raining.* (not *~~Is raining.~~*)
- *She loved the picture because **it** reminded her of home.* (not *~~… because reminded her of home.~~*)
- *They arrested Alex and put **him** in prison.* (not *~~… and put in prison.~~*)
- *‘Have some chocolate.’ ‘No, I don’t like **it**.’* (not *~~… I don’t like.~~*)

## One subject is enough

One subject is enough. We do not usually use a personal pronoun to repeat a subject that comes in the same clause.

- ***My car** is parked outside.* (not *~~My car it is parked outside.~~*)
- ***The budget forecast** was reasonably accurate.* (not *~~The budget forecast it was reasonably accurate.~~*)
- ***The situation** is terrible.* (not *~~It is terrible the situation.~~*)

There are exceptions in very informal speech [(see here)](./../speech-and-spoken-exchanges/spoken-sentence-structure).

- ***He**’s not a bad bloke, **Jeff**.*
- ***It**’s a horrible place, **London**.*

:::note

For *it* as a **preparatory subject** or **object**, [(see here)](./../information-structure/preparatory-it-subject).

## Personal and relative pronouns: one or the other, not both

We do not use personal pronouns to repeat the meaning of relative pronouns [(see here)](./../relative-clauses/relatives-basic-information#one-subject-or-object-is-enough).

- *That’s the girl **who** lives in the next room.* (not *~~… who she lives …~~*)
- *Here’s the money **(that)** you lent me.* (not *~~… (that) you lent me it.~~*)

## *it* referring to *nothing*, the situation, etc

*It* not only refers to particular things. *It* can also refer to a whole fact, event or situation.

- *Our passports were stolen. **It** completely ruined our trip.*
- *I did all I could, but **it** wasn’t enough.*
- ***It**’s terrible – everybody’s got colds, and the central heating isn’t working.*
- *Wasn’t **it** lovely there!*
- ***Nothing** happened, did **it**?*
- ***Everything**’s all right, isn’t **it**?*

## *it* as ‘empty’ subject: *It’s ten o’clock.*

We use *it* as a meaningless subject with expressions that refer to time, weather, temperature or distances.

- ***It**’s ten o’clock.* (not *~~Is ten o’clock.~~*)
- ***It** rained for three days.*
- ***It**’s Monday again.*
- ***It**’s thirty degrees.*
- ***It**’s ten miles to the nearest garage.*

## *it* used to identify

We use *it* for a person when we are identifying him or her.

- *‘Who’s that over there?’ ‘**It**’s Jack Cook.’* (not *~~He’s Jack Cook.~~*)
- *‘Is that our waiter?’ ‘No, **it** isn’t.’* (not *~~No, he isn’t.~~*)
- *(on the phone) Hello. **It**’s Luke Williams.* (not *~~… I’m Luke Williams.~~*)
- ***It**’s your sister who plays the piano, isn’t **it**?*

## *we women*, *you men*

*We* and plural *you* (but not other personal pronouns) can be put directly before nouns.

- ***We women** know things that **you men** will never understand.* (but not *~~I woman know …~~*) or *~~… they men will never understand.~~*
