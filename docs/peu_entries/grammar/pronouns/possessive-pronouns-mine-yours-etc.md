# Possessive pronouns: *mine*, *yours*, etc

Like all ‘possessive’ words and structures, *mine*, *yours*, *his*, *hers*, *ours* and *theirs* can express various ideas besides possession. They are similar to *my*, *your*, etc, but they are not determiners, and are used without following nouns. Compare:

- *That’s **my coat**.*  
  *That coat is **mine**.*
- *Which is **your car**?*  
  *Which car is **yours**?*

*Whose* can be used with or without a following noun ( [(see here)](./../determiners-a-an-and-the-my-your-etc-this-that-etc/possessive-determiners-my-your-etc), [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/whose-question-word).

- ***Whose car** is that?*
- ***Whose** is that car?*

We do not use articles with *mine*, etc.

- *Can I borrow your keys? I can’t find **mine**.* (not *~~I can’t find the mine.~~*)

*One’s* cannot be used without a following noun; instead, we use *one’s own*.

- *It’s nice to have a room of **one’s own**.* (not *~~… of one’s.~~*)

*Its* is not normally used without a following noun.

- *I’ve had my breakfast, and the dog’s had **its breakfast** too.* (not *~~… and the dog’s had its.~~*)
