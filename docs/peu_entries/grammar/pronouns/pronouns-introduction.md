# Introduction

**Pronouns** are words that are used instead of noun phrases, when it is unnecessary or impossible to use a more precise expression. Examples:

- *I* – meaning ‘the speaker’
- *it* – referring to a thing that has already been mentioned
- *your* – meaning ‘belonging to or associated with the hearer(s)’
- *somebody* – referring to an unknown or undefined person
- *one* – meaning for example ‘people in general’

Most pronouns are covered in this Section. For **relative pronouns**, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/which-what-and-who-question-words). For *whoever*, *whatever*, *whichever*, [(see here)](./../other-adverbial-clauses/whoever-whatever-etc).

Some **determiners** (e.g. *this*, *both*, *most*) can be used alone without following nouns, like pronouns, when the determiner alone makes the meaning clear.

- *Look at **this**.* (= ‘this thing that you can see’)
- *‘Which scarf would you like? ’ ‘I’ll take **both**.’*  (= ‘both scarves’)
- *Not all bears can climb trees, but **most** can.* (= ‘most bears’)

These pronoun-like uses of determiners are covered in [*Determiners: a/an and the; my, your, etc; this, that, etc*](../determiners-a-an-and-the-my-your-etc-this-that-etc/determiners-a-an-and-the-my-your-etc-this-that-etc-introduction), [*Determiners: quantifiers*](../determiners-quantifiers/determiners-quantifiers-introduction), along with their other uses.
