# Reciprocal pronouns: *each other* and *one another*

## No difference

*Each other* and *one another* mean the same.

- *Anna and I write to **each other / one another** every week.*

*Each other* is more common than *one another*, especially in an informal style.

## Not used as subject

*Each other* and *one another* are not normally used as subjects (though this occasionally happens in subordinate clauses in very informal speech).

- *They **each** listened carefully to what **the other** said.* (not usually *They listened carefully to what each other said.*)

## *each other’s / one another’s*

Both expressions have possessive forms.

- *They’ll sit for hours looking into **each other’s / one another’s** eyes.*

## *-selves*, possessives and *each other* / *one another*

Note the difference between *\-selves* and *each other / one another*. Compare:

- *Jack and Emily are strange: they talk to **themselves** a lot.* (Jack talks to Jack; Emily talks to Emily.)
- *Susan and Daniel talk to **each other** on the phone every day.* (Susan talks to Daniel; Daniel talks to Susan.)

There is a similar difference between possessives and *each other* / *one another*. Compare:

- *My girlfriend and I are both very interested in **our** work.* (I’m interested in mine; she’s interested in hers.)
- *My girlfriend and I are both very interested in **each other’s** work.* (I’m interested in hers; she’s interested in mine.)

## Words used without *each other* / *one another*

We do not normally use *each other* / *one another* after words like *meet* or *marry*, where the verb itself makes the meaning clear.

- *They **met** in 1992 and **married** in 1994.*
