# reflexive pronouns: myself, etc

## What are reflexive pronouns?

Reflexive pronouns are *myself*, *yourself*, *himself*, *herself*, *itself*, *oneself*, *ourselves*, *yourselves*, *themselves*.

## Use: *I cut myself shaving.*

Reflexive pronouns are used as objects, in cases when the object refers to the same person(s) or thing(s) as the subject.

- ***I** cut **myself** shaving this morning.* (not *~~I cut me …~~*)
- ***We** got out of the water and dried **ourselves**.* (not *~~… dried us.~~*)
- ***I** need to get **myself** some new shoes.*

Reflexive pronouns can refer back not only to subjects, but also to possessives or objects.

- ***His** conversations are all about **himself**.*
- *I’m going to tell **her** a few facts about **herself**.*
- *I love **you** for **yourself**, not for your money.*

## Same clause

A reflexive only refers to a noun in the same clause. Compare:

- *Jack says that **James** talks to **himself** a lot.* (James talks to James, not to Jack.)
- ***Jack** says that James talks to **him** a lot.* (James talks to Jack, not to James.)

## After prepositions: *She took her dog with her.*

After prepositions of place, we often use a personal pronoun (*me*, *you*, etc) if the meaning is clear without using a reflexive. Compare:

- ***She** took her dog **with her**.* (not *~~… with herself.~~* She could hardly take her dog with somebody else.)
- ***She**’s very pleased **with herself**.* (She could be pleased with somebody else.)

Other examples:

- *Close the door **after you**.*
- ***He** was pulling a small cart **behind him**.*

## Emphatic use: *Do it yourself.*

We can use reflexives as emphasisers, to mean ‘that person/thing and nobody/nothing else’.

- *It’s quicker if you do it **yourself**.*
- *The manageress spoke to me **herself**.*
- *The house **itself** is nice, but the garden’s very small.*
- *I’ll go and see the President **himself** if I have to.*

## Reflexives used instead of personal pronouns

Reflexives are sometimes used instead of personal pronouns after *as*, *like*, *but (for)* and *except (for)*.

- *These shoes are designed for heavy runners **like yourself**.* (or … ***like you***.)
- *Everybody was early **except myself**.* (or … ***except me***.)

Reflexives can also be used instead of personal pronouns in co-ordinated noun phrases.

- *There will be four of us at dinner: Robert, Alison, Jenny **and myself**.* (or *… and I/**me**.*)

## *by oneself*

*By myself/yourself*, etc means ‘alone, without company’ or ‘without help’.

- *I often like to spend time **by myself**.*
- *‘Do you need help?’ ‘No, thanks. I can do it **by myself**.’*

## *-selves* and *each other* / *one another*

Note the difference between *\-selves* and *each other* / *one another* [(see here)](./reciprocal-pronouns-each-other-and-one-another).

- *They talk to **themselves** a lot.* (Each of them talks to him/herself.)
- *They talk to **each other** a lot.* (Each of them talks to the other.)

## *own*

There are no possessive reflexives. Instead, we use *my own*, *your own*, etc.

- *I always wash **my own** clothes.* (not *~~… myself’s clothes.~~*)
- *The children have both got **their own** rooms.*

## Reflexives not used

Certain verbs (e.g. *wash*, *dress*, *shave*) have reflexive pronouns in some languages but not in English.

- *Do you **shave** on Sundays?* (not *~~Do you shave yourself on Sundays?~~*)

However, reflexives can be used if it is necessary to make it clear who does the action.

- *She’s old enough to **dress herself** now.*
- *The barber shaves all the men in the town who don’t **shave themselves**. So does he **shave himself** or not?*

Some other verbs which do not normally have reflexive pronouns:

- *Suddenly the door **opened**.* (not *~~Suddenly the door opened itself.~~*)
- *His book’**s selling** well.* (not *~~His book’s selling itself well.~~*)
- *Try to **concentrate**.* (not *~~Try to concentrate yourself.~~*)
- *I **feel** strange.* (not *~~I feel myself strange.~~*)
- ***Hurry**!* (not *~~Hurry yourself!~~*)
