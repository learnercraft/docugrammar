# Singular *they*

## *Somebody left their umbrella.*

*They*/*them*/*their* is often used to refer to a singular indefinite person. This is common after *a person*, *anybody*/*one*, *somebody*/*one*, *nobody*/*one*, *whoever*, *each*, *every*, *either*, *neither* and *no*. *They* has a plural verb in this case.

- *If a person doesn’t want to go on living, **they are** often very difficult to help.*
- *If anybody calls, take **their** name and ask **them** to call again later.*
- *Somebody left **their** umbrella in the office. Would **they** please collect it?*
- *Nobody was late, **were they**?*
- *Whoever comes, tell **them** I’m not in.*
- *Tell each person to help **themselves** to what they want.*
- *Every individual thinks **they’re** different from everybody else.*

This singular use of *they*/*them*/*their* is convenient when the person referred to could be either male or female (as in the examples above). *He or she*, *him or her* and *his or her* are clumsy, especially when repeated, and many people dislike the traditional use of *he*/*him*/*his* in this situation [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/vocabulary-areas/gender-references-to-males-and-females).

However, *they*/*them*/*their* can also be used when the person’s sex is known. Two examples from interviews:

- *I swear more when I’m talking to a boy, because I’m not afraid of shocking **them**.*
- *No girl should have to wear school uniform, because it makes **them** look like a sack of potatoes.*

*They*/*them*/*their* is sometimes used for a definite person who is not identified.

- *I had a friend in Paris, and **they** disappeared for a month.*

## Correctness

This use of *they*/*them*/*their* has existed for centuries, and is perfectly correct. It is most common in an informal style, but can also be found in formal written English. Here is an example from an old British passport application form:

- *Dual nationality: if the child possesses the nationality or citizenship of another country **they** may lose this when **they** get a British Passport.*
