# Introduction

## What are relative clauses?

Clauses beginning with question words (e.g. *who*, *which*, *where*) are often used to modify nouns and some pronouns – to identify people and things, or to give more information about them. These are called ‘**relative clauses**’.

- *Do you know the people **who live next door**?*
- *There’s a programme tonight **which you might like**.*
- *He lives in a village **where there are no shops**.*
- *Leslie, **who works with me**, often babysits for us.*

When *who*, *which*, *where*, etc are used in this way, they are called ‘**relative pronouns**’. *That* can also be used as a relative pronoun. There are two kinds of relative clause [(see here)](./identifying-and-non-identifying-clauses-the-tall-man-who-mr-rogers-who): those that typically say **who** or **what** we are talking about (‘identifying clauses’), and those that typically just give **extra information** (‘non-identifying clauses’).
