# Relatives: basic information

## *who*, *whom* and *which*

The relative pronouns *who* and *whom* refer to people; *which* refers to things.

- *What’s the name of the tall man **who** just came in?* (not *~~… the tall man which …~~*)
- *It’s a book **which** will interest children of all ages.* (not *~~… a book who …~~*)

## Subject and object

*Who* and *which* can be the subjects of verbs in relative clauses.

- *I like people **who smile** a lot.*
- *This is the back door key, **which also opens** the garage.*

*Who(m)* and *which* can also be the objects of verbs in relative clauses. *Whom* is unusual in an informal style [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/who-and-whom).

- *Do you remember the people **who we met** in Italy?* (*Who* is the object of *met*.)
- *I forget most of the films **which I see**.* (*Which* is the object of *see*.)

## *that* = *who*/*which*

We often use *that* instead of *who* or *which*, especially in an informal style.

- *I like people **that** smile a lot.*
- *This is the key **that** opens the garage.*
- *Do you remember the people **that** we met in Italy?*
- *I forget most of the films **that** I see.*

## *all that*, *only … that*, etc

*That* is especially common after quantifiers like *all*, *every(thing)*, *some(thing)*, *any(thing)*, *no(thing)*, *none*, *little*, *few*, *much*, *only*, and after superlatives.

- *Is this **all that**’s left?* (More natural than *… all which is left?*)
- *Have you got **anything that** belongs to me?* (More natural than *… anything which …*)
- *The **only** thing **that** matters is to find our way home.*
- *I hope the **little that** I’ve done has been useful.*
- *It’s the **best** film **that**’s ever been made about madness.*

Note that *what* [(see here)](./what) cannot be used in these cases.

- ***All that** you say is certainly true.* (not *~~All what you say …~~*)

## Leaving out object pronouns: *the people we met*

Object pronouns can often be left out.

- *Do you remember **the people we met** in Italy?*
- *I forget most of **the films I see**.*
- ***All I want** is your happiness.*

This is not possible in all relative clauses: [(see here)](./identifying-and-non-identifying-clauses-the-tall-man-who-mr-rogers-who).

## One subject or object is enough

As subjects or objects, *who(m)*, *which* and *that* replace words like *she*, *him* or *it*: one subject or object in a relative clause is enough. Compare:

- *He’s got a new girlfriend. **She** works in a garage.*  
  *He’s got a new girlfriend **who** works in a garage.* (not *~~… who she works in a garage.~~*)
- *This is Mr Rogers. You met **him** last year.*  
  *This is Mr Rogers, **whom** you met last year.* (not *~~… whom you met him last year.~~*)
- *Here’s an article. **It** might interest you.*  
  *Here’s an article **which** might interest you.* (not *~~… which it might interest you.~~*)

Prepositional verbs, like others, only have one object.

- *Are there any papers **that** I can **look at**?* (not *~~… that I can look at them?~~*)
- *I’ve found the keys **that** you were **asking about**.* (not *~~… that you were asking about them.~~*)

## *whose*: *a girl whose hair …*

*Whose* is a possessive relative pronoun, used as a determiner before nouns. It replaces *his*/*her*/*its*. For more details, [(see here)](./whose).

- *I saw a girl **whose hair** came down to her waist.* (not *~~… whose her hair came down …~~*)

## *which* referring to a whole clause

*Which* can refer not only to a noun, but also to the whole of a previous clause. Note that *what* cannot be used in this way.

- *He got married again a year later, **which** surprised everybody.* (not *~~… , what surprised everybody.~~*)
- *She cycled from London to Glasgow, **which** is pretty good for a woman of 75.* (not *~~She cycled … , what is pretty good …~~*)

## Relative *when*, *where* and *why*

*When* and *where* can introduce relative clauses after nouns referring to time and place. They are used in the same way as preposition + *which*.

- *I’ll never forget the day **when** I first met you.* (= … the day on which …)
- *Do you know a shop **where** I can find sandals?* (= … a shop at which …)

*Why* is used in a similar way after *reason*.

- *Do you know the reason **why** she doesn’t like me?* (= … the reason for which …)
