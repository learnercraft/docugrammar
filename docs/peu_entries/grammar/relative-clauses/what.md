# what

## Meaning and use: *the thing(s) which*

*What* does not refer to a noun that comes before it. It acts as noun + relative pronoun together, and means ‘the thing(s) which’. Clauses beginning with *what* can act as subjects, objects, or complements after *be*.

- ***What she said** made me angry.* (subject of *made*)
- *I hope you’re going to give me **what I need**.* (object of *give*)
- *This is exactly **what I wanted**.* (complement)

:::note

For singular and plural verbs after *what* (e.g. *What we need most is/are books*), [(see here)](./../nouns-and-noun-phrases-agreement/mixed-singular-and-plural-other-structures#who-and-what).

## *what* not used

*What* is only used to mean ‘the thing(s) which’. It cannot be used as an ordinary relative pronoun after a noun or pronoun.

- *We haven’t got **everything that** you ordered.* (not *~~… everything what …~~*)
- *The **only thing that** keeps me awake is coffee.* (not *~~The only thing what …~~*)

We use *which*, not *what*, to refer to a whole clause that comes before. [(see here)](./relatives-basic-information#which-referring-to-a-whole-clause)

- ***Sophie married Joe**, **which** made Oliver unhappy.* (not *~~… what made …~~*)

## *what* as a determiner: *what money he has*

*What* can also be used as a determiner with a noun. It often means something like ‘the only’, ‘the little’ or ‘the few’.

- ***What money** he has comes from his family.* (= The little money that he has …)
- *I’ll give you **what help** I can.* (= … any help that I can.)
