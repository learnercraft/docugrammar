# Avoiding repetition: *Wonderful, isn’t it?*

Speech is more tolerant of repetition than formal writing [(see here)](./../written-texts/repetition), but even in spoken exchanges people often prefer to avoid repeating each other’s words without a good reason. There is a common kind of exchange where one speaker gives his/her opinion of something, and the other agrees by saying the same thing in other words which are at least as emphatic. Repetition is carefully avoided.

- *‘Glorious day.’ ‘**Wonderful**, isn’t it?’* (not usually *Glorious, isn’t it?*)
- *‘Terrible weather.’ ‘**Dreadful**.’*
- *‘United didn’t play very well, then.’ ‘Absolute **rubbish**.’*

Speakers can of course repeat vocabulary and structures deliberately. This can be done for emphasis.

- *I’m very **very** angry.*
- *You’ll eat every mouthful. **Every** single **mouthful**.*

Repeating somebody else’s words can show surprise or disbelief.

- *‘I’m getting married.’ ‘You’re **getting married**? Who to?’*
