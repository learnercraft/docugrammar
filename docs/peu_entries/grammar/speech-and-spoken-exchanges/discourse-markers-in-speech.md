# Discourse markers in speech

Discourse markers are words and expressions which help to structure spoken exchanges and written text. (e.g. *first of all*, *by the way*, *on the other hand*, *in any case*, *to sum up*). English has a very large number of these. Some are used in all kinds of discourse, some mostly in formal writing, and others mainly in informal speech. Those that are most common in speech are discussed here; some of these (but not all) are also used in formal writing, [(see here)](./../written-texts/discourse-markers-in-writing). Discourse markers can communicate several things:

- **‘What are we talking about?’** They can introduce or clarify a topic, and show divisions and changes of topic.
- **‘What are we doing?’** They can show the type of communication that is going on.
- **attitude** They can show a speaker’s attitude to what he or she is saying, or to the listener’s expectations.

## What are we talking about?

Some discourse markers say what a speaker is going to focus on, and may show a link with previous discussion. Others show subdivisions and changes of topic.

Some discourse markers express the speaker’s attitude to what he/she is saying, or modify what is being said to make the communication more effective.

### showing speaker’s attitude

:::tip[Phrases]

*no doubt; honestly; frankly*

- *He’s not always very good at organising his life. **At least**, that’s my impression.*
- *‘I **sort of** wondered if you could help me with this.’ ‘Sorry, **I’m afraid** I’m not free.’*
- *I can’t get to the hospital to see Julie. **I mean**, not this week, anyway.*
- *She lives at 19 Gordon Terrace – **or rather**, Gordon Close.* (not *~~… or better …~~*)
- *My brother didn’t do well at school, though **actually**, he did get a prize for art.*

### dismissing what was said before

:::tip[Phrases]

*in any case; anyhow; anyway; at any rate*

:::

These expressions mean ‘What was said before doesn’t matter – this is the real point.’

- *Maybe it was Daniel, or maybe it was Joe. Or Jack. **Anyway**, it was one of them.*
- *I can’t get to the hospital to see Julie. I mean, not this week, **anyhow**.*
- *The hotel’s probably OK. It’s cheap, and the place seems clean. **At any rate**, it’s better than sleeping in the car.*

### referring to the hearer’s expectations

:::tip[Phrases]

*in fact; actually; as a matter of fact; to tell the truth; well; actually*

:::

These expressions introduce information that will contradict (usually) or perhaps confirm what the hearer or reader thinks.

- *‘So what do you think?’ ‘**To tell the truth**, I wasn’t really listening to what everyone was saying.’*
- *‘How are your medical studies going?’ ‘**As a matter of fact**, I’ve decided to drop out for a year and get a job.’*

- *‘How did the team do?’ ‘**Well**, they lost.’*

### gaining time

:::tip[Phrases]

*let me see; let’s see; let me think; well; you know; I don’t know; I mean; kind of; sort of*

:::

- *‘How much is it going to cost?’ ‘**Let me see.** There’s materials. And transport. And …’*
- *‘When can you pay me back?’ ‘**Well, you know, let me think, I don’t know, I mean**, things are **kind of** tight just now, …’*

### checking common ground

:::tip[Phrases]

*you know; (you) know what I mean?; of course* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/of-course)*; you see*

:::

A speaker says ‘you know’ to tell the hearer (or to pretend) that they share the same piece of information.

- *I was talking to Marty – **you know**, the guy who works with Alex – and he thinks we can …*
- *We were in Haworth – **you know**, the village where the Brontës lived. And …*
- *He never called her. Because unattractive men don’t want unattractive girls; **(you) know what I mean**?*

*Of course* implies that everybody knows something (and can be used to make the hearer feel inferior for not knowing it!).

- *It’s a lovely piece, isn’t it? **Of course**, it was originally written for violin and piano, …*

*You see* introduces information that the speaker thinks the hearer does not share.

- *It’s no good using this battery charger. **You see**, it’s 12 volts, and your battery is 6 volts.*
- *I’m sorry, but you can’t come in here. **You see**, it’s for members only.*
