# Pronunciation: intonation

Intonation is the word for the ‘melody’ of spoken language: the way the musical pitch of the voice rises and falls. Intonation systems in languages are very complicated and difficult to analyse, and linguists do not all agree about how English intonation works.

## Intonation in conversation

One use of intonation is to show how a piece of information fits in with what comes before and after. For instance, a speaker may raise his or her voice when taking over the conversation from somebody else, or to indicate a change of subject. A rise or fall on a particular word may show that this is the ‘centre’ of the message – the place where the new information is being given; or it may signal a contrast or a special emphasis. A rising tone at the end of a sentence may suggest that there is more to be said and perhaps invite another speaker to take over.

## Attitude

Intonation (together with speed, voice quality and loudness) can also say things about the speaker’s attitude. For instance, when people are excited or angry they often raise and lower their voices more.

## Three patterns

There are three particularly common intonation patterns in English speech.

## Falling intonation

A falling intonation can suggest that we are saying something definite, complete. The voice falls on the last stressed syllable of a group of words.

</pre>
<pre>
``                  ↘``
<em>Sophie couldn’t find him.</em>
</pre>
</details>

A falling intonation is also common in *wh*\-questions.

``               ↘``
<em>Where’s the secretary?</em>
</pre>
</details>

## Rising intonation

A rising intonation is common in *yes/no* questions. The voice rises at the end of a group of words, beginning on the last stressed syllable.

<em>Is that the secretary?</em>
</pre>
<pre>
``         ___↗``
<em>Did he sign it?</em>
</pre>
</details>

In ‘alternative questions’ with *or*, the voice rises on the first part of the question and falls on the second part.

## Fall-rise

A fall-rise intonation suggests that something is incomplete, or uncertain, or that there is more to be said.

(perhaps suggesting *But I do play other games.*)

<pre>
``        ↘            ↗``
<em>She’s quite a good teacher.</em>
</pre>

(perhaps suggesting *But I’m not completely happy with her.*)

<pre>
``      ↘              ↗``
<em>The first week was good.</em>
</pre>

(perhaps suggesting *But not the second.*)

<pre>
``           ↘            ↗``
<em>Is this all you’ve written?</em>
</pre>

(perhaps suggesting *I was expecting more.*)

A fall-rise makes questions sound more interested or friendly. It is common in polite requests and invitations.

## Intonation and misunderstandings

If a statement is made on a rising intonation, it may be misunderstood as a question.

``               ↗``
<em>‘That’s our train.’</em>
<em>‘I don’t know.’  ‘Yes, it is, I’m telling you.’</em>
</pre>
</details>

If a declarative question [(see here)](./declarative-questions-that-s-the-boss) is made on a falling intonation, it may be misunderstood as a statement.

<pre>
``               ↘``
<em>‘That’s our train?’</em>
<em>‘Is it?’  ‘No, I’m asking you.’</em>
</pre>
</details>

A falling intonation can also turn a polite request into an order.

<em>‘Can I have some more coffee?’</em>
<em>‘At once, Your Majesty.’</em>
</pre>
</details>

A fall-rise in the wrong place can be misunderstood as suggesting more than is said.
