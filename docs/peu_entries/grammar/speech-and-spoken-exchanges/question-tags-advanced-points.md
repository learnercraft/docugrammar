# Question tags: advanced points

## *aren’t I?*

The question tag for *I am* is *aren’t I?*

- *I’m late, **aren’t I?***

*Am I not?* is also possible in very formal contexts.

## Imperatives: *Come in, won’t you?*

After imperatives, *won’t you?* can be used to invite people politely to do things (especially in British English).

- *Come in, *won’t you?**

*Will/would/can/could you?* can all be used to tell or ask people to do things.

- *Give me a hand, **will you?***
- *Open a window, **would you?***

*Can’t you* expresses impatience.

- *Shut up, **can’t you?***

After a negative imperative, we use *will you?*

- ***Don’t** forget, **will you?***

## *Let’s …, shall we?*

After *let’s …* (in suggestions, etc, [(see here)](./../basic-clause-types/let-introducing-imperatives), we use *shall we?*

- ***Let’s** have a party, **shall we?***

## *There’s …, isn’t there?*

*There* can be used in question tags.

- *There’s something wrong, **isn’t there?***
- *There weren’t any problems, **were there?***

When *there’s* introduces a plural noun phrase [(see here)](./../nouns-and-noun-phrases-agreement/mixed-singular-and-plural-other-structures#here-s-there-s-and-where-s), the tag is *aren’t there?*

- ***There’s** some more **chairs** upstairs, **aren’t there?***

## *it* and *they* with *nothing*, *nobody*, *somebody*, etc

We use *it* in question tags to refer to *nothing* and *everything*.

- ***Nothing** can happen, can **it?***

We use *they* [(see here)](./../pronouns/singular-they) to refer to *nobody*, *somebody* and *everybody* (and *no one*, etc).

- ***Nobody** phoned, **did they?***
- ***Somebody** wanted a drink, didn’t **they?** Who was it?*

## Non-auxiliary *have*

After non-auxiliary *have* (referring to states), question tags with *have* and *do* are often both possible. (*Do* is normal in American English.)

- *Your father **has** a bad back, **hasn’t/doesn’t he?***

## ‘same-way’ question tags: *You’re getting married*, *are you?*

Non-negative question tags are quite common after affirmative sentences. These are often used as responses to something that has been said: the speaker repeats what he/she has just learnt, and uses the tag to express interest, surprise, concern or some other reaction.

- *So **you’re** getting married, **are you?** How nice!*
- *So **she thinks** she’s going to become a doctor, **does she?** Well, well.*
- ***You think** you’re funny, **do you?***

‘Same-way’ tags can also be used to ask questions. In this structure, we use the main sentence to make a guess, and then ask (in the tag) if it was correct.

- ***Your mother’s** at home, **is she**?*
- ***This is** the last bus, **is it?***
- ***You can** eat shellfish, **can you?***

*I’ll …, shall I?* can be used to make offers.

- ***I’ll hold** that for you, **shall I?***

Negative ‘same-way’ tags are occasionally heard; they usually sound aggressive.

- *I see. You **don’t** like my cooking, **don’t you?***

## Ellipsis: *Nice day*, *isn’t it?*

In sentences with question tags, it is quite common to leave out pronoun subjects and auxiliary verbs. (This is called ‘ellipsis’. For details, [(see here)](./../information-structure/ellipsis-at-the-beginning-of-a-sentence).)

- ***(It’s a)** nice day, isn’t it?*
- ***(She was)** talking to my husband, was she?*

In very informal speech, a question tag can sometimes be used after a question with ellipsis.

- ***Have** a good time, **did you?***
- ***Your mother** at home, **is she?***
- ***Jack be** here tomorrow, **will he?***

## *I (don’t) think*

Note the use of question tags in sentences beginning with *I (don’t) think* and similar expressions [(see here)](./../information-structure/ellipsis-at-the-beginning-of-a-sentence).

- *I think he’s Norwegian, **isn’t he?*** (not *~~… don’t I?~~*)
- *I don’t think it will rain, **will it?*** (not *~~… do I?~~*)
- *I suppose you’re hungry, **aren’t you?***

## Simpler question tags

In informal speech, simpler tags such as *No?* (after affirmatives) and *Right?* are very often used to check information or ask for agreement.

- *We’re seeing her tomorrow, **no**?*
- *They all speak English, **right**?*
- *You haven’t got a ticket, **right**?*

*Right* can also be used, rather aggressively, to mean ‘Is that clear to you?’

- *This is your last chance, **right**?*
- *I’m not working extra hours, **right**?*

In non-standard speech, *isn’t it?* / *innit?* is common as a universal question tag.

- *You wants them bricks today, **innit**?*
