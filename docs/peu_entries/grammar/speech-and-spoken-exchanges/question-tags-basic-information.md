# Question tags: basic information

## What are question tags?

‘Question tags’ (also called ‘tag questions’) are the small questions that often come at the ends of sentences in speech, and sometimes in informal writing.

- *The film wasn’t very good, **was it?***

Negatives are usually contracted. Full forms are possible in formal speech.

- *That’s the doorbell, **isn’t it?***
- *You take sugar in tea, **don’t you?***
- *They promised to repay us within six months, **did they not?*** (formal)

Question tags can be used to check whether something is true, or to ask for agreement.

## Negative after affirmative, and vice versa

Question tags are used after affirmative and negative sentences, but not after questions.

- ***You’re** the new secretary, **aren’t you?***
- ***You’re not** the new secretary, **are you?***
- *(but not *~~Are you the new secretary, aren’t you?~~*)*

To check information or ask for agreement, we most often put negative tags after affirmative sentences, and non-negative tags after negative sentences.

## Auxiliaries

If the main sentence has an auxiliary verb (or non-auxiliary *be*), this is repeated in the question tag.

<pre>
``        ↓------------------|``
<em>Sophia <strong>can</strong> speak French, <strong>can't</strong> she?</em>
</pre>
<pre>
``            ↓-----------|``
<em>The meeting<strong>'s</strong> at ten, <strong>isn't</strong> it?</em>
</pre>
<pre>
``      ↓--------------------|``
<em>You <strong>didn't</strong> speak to Luke, <strong>did</strong> you?</em>
</pre>
<pre>
``        ↓--------------------|``
<em>You <strong>wouldn't</strong> like a puppy, <strong>would</strong> you?</em>
</pre>
</details>

If the main sentence has no auxiliary, the question tag has *do*.

</pre>

## Negative words

Non-negative tags are used after sentences containing negative words like *never*, *no*, *nobody*, *hardly*, *scarcely* and *little*.

- *You **never** say what you’re thinking, **do you?*** (not *~~… don’t you?~~*)
- *It’s **no** good, **is it?*** (not *~~… isn’t it?~~*)
- *It’s **hardly** rained at all this summer, **has it?***
- *There’s **little** we can do about it, **is there**?*

## Meaning and intonation

In speech, we can show the exact meaning of a question tag by the intonation. If the tag is a real question – if we really want to know something and are not sure of the answer – we use a rising intonation: the voice goes up.

<em>The meeting's at four o'clock, <strong>isn't it</strong>?</em>
</pre>
</details>

If the tag is not a real question – if we are sure of the answer – we use a falling intonation: the voice goes down.

``                           ↘``
<em>It's a beautiful day, <strong>isn't it</strong>?</em>
</pre>
</details>

In writing, the exact meaning of a question tag is normally clear from the context.

## Requests: *You couldn’t …, could you?*

We often ask for help or information by using the structure negative statement + question tag.

- *You **couldn’t** lend me a pound, **could you?***
- *You **haven’t** seen my watch anywhere, **have you?***
