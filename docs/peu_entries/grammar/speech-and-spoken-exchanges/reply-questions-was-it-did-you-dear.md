# Reply questions: *Was it? Did you, dear?*

Short questions are often used in conversation to show that the listener is paying attention and interested. They are constructed with auxiliary verb + pronoun, like question tags [(see here)](./question-tags-basic-information).

- *‘It was a terrible party.’ ‘**Was it?**’ ‘Yes …’*

Note that these questions do not ask for information – they simply show that the listener is reacting to what has been said. More examples:

- *‘We had a lovely trip.’ ‘**Did you?**’ ‘Yes, we went …’*
- *‘I’ve got a headache.’ ‘**Have you**, dear? I’ll get you an aspirin.’*
- *‘Jack likes that girl next door.’ ‘Oh, **does he?**’*
- *‘I don’t understand.’ ‘**Don’t you?** I’m sorry.’*

Negative questions in reply to affirmative statements express emphatic agreement (like negative-question exclamations, [(see here)](./../basic-clause-types/exclamations#negative-question-forms).

- *‘It was a lovely concert.’ ‘Yes, **wasn’t it?** I did enjoy it.’*
- *‘She’s put on a lot of weight.’ ‘Yes, **hasn’t she**?’*
