# so am I, neither do they, etc

## *so* + auxiliary + subject

We can use *so* to mean ‘similarly, also’, before auxiliary verb + subject. The structure is used to answer or add to what came before. Note the word order.

- *Louise can dance beautifully, and **so can her sister**.*
- *‘I’ve lost their address.’ ‘**So have I**.’*

The same structure is possible with non-auxiliary *be* and *have*.

- *I was tired, and **so were the others**.*
- *‘I have a headache.’ ‘**So have I**.’*

After a clause with no auxiliary verb, we use *do*/*does*/*did*.

- *‘He just wants the best for his country.’ ‘**So did Hitler**.’*

We do not normally use a more complete verb phrase in this structure. We can say, for example, *So can her sister*, but not *~~So can her sister dance~~.*

A more informal alternative to *So am I*, etc is *Me too*.

- *‘I’m getting bored.’ ‘**Me too**.’* (not *~~I also.~~*)

## Neither do I, I can’t either, etc

We can use *neither* and *nor* as adverbs to mean ‘also not’. *Neither* and *nor* come at the beginning of a clause, and are followed by inverted word order [(see here)](./../information-structure/inversion-auxiliary-verb-before-subject): auxiliary verb + subject.

- *‘I can’t swim.’ ‘**Neither**/**nor can I**. (not *~~I also can’t.~~*)’*
- *Ruth didn’t turn up, and **neither**/**nor did Kate**.* (not *~~… and Kate didn’t too.~~*)

In American English, *nor* is not normally used after *and*.

We can also use *not … either* with the same meaning and normal word order.

- *‘I can’t swim.’ ‘**I can’t either**.’*
- *Ruth didn’t turn up, and **Kate didn’t either**.*

In very informal speech, *me neither* (and occasionally *me either*, especially in American English) can be used instead of *I …n’t either*.

- *‘I can’t swim.’ ‘**Me neither**.’*

Only one negative word (*not* or *neither*) is necessary to give a negative meaning.

- ***Neither** did Kate* ``or`` *Kate did**n’t** either.* (not *~~Neither didn’t Kate~~*) or *~~Kate didn’t neither~~*

## *so* + subject + auxiliary: *So it is!*

*So* is used in another short structure before subject + auxiliary verb (note the word order) to express surprised agreement.

- *‘It’s raining.’ ‘Why, **so it is**!’*
- *‘You’ve just put the teapot in the fridge.’ ‘**So I have**!’*
