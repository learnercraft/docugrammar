# Future in the past

Sometimes when we are talking about the past, we want to talk about something which was in the future at that time – which had not yet happened. To express this idea, we use the structures that are normally used to talk about the future ([(see here)](./going-to), but we make the verb forms past. For example, instead of *is going to* we use *was going to*; instead of the present progressive we use the past progressive; instead of *will* we use *would*; instead of *is to* we use *was to*.

- *Last time I saw you, you **were going to start** a new job.*
- *I had no time to shop because I **was leaving** for Germany in two hours.*
- *In 1988 I arrived in the town where I **would spend** ten years of my life.*
- *I went to have a look at the room where I **was to talk** that afternoon.*

Perfect forms of *be going to* are also possible.

- *I’**ve been going to write** to you for ages, but I’ve only just found time.*

:::note

For *was to have* + past participle (e.g. *She was to have taken over my job, but she fell ill*), [(see here)](./be-to-infinitive-i-am-to-you-are-to-etc#plans-and-arrangements-he-is-to-visit-nigeria).
