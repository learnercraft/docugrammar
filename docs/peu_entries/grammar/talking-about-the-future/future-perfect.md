# Future perfect

:::tip[Grammar]

*will have* + past participle

:::

We can use the future perfect to say that something will be finished or complete by a certain time in the future.

- *The builders say they **will have finished** the roof by Tuesday.*
- *I’**ll have spent** all my savings by the end of the year.*

A progressive form can be used to talk about a continuous activity.

- *I’**ll have been teaching** for twenty years this summer.*

:::note

For *will have* … used to express certainty about the past (e.g. *It’s no use phoning – he’ll have left by now*), [see here](./will-going-to-and-present-progressive-advanced-points#expressing-certainty-about-the-present-or-past).
