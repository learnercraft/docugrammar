# *going to*

## A present tense

This structure is really a present tense (the present progressive of *go*). We use it to talk about future actions and events that have some present reality. If we say that something in the future *is going to happen*, it is usually already planned or decided, or it is starting to happen, or we can see it coming now. The structure is very common in an informal style, especially in speech (because conversation is often about future actions and events of this kind).

## Plans: *We’re going to get a new car.*

We use *be going to* + infinitive to talk about plans, especially in an informal style. This structure often emphasises the idea of intention, or a decision that has already been made.

- *We’**re going to get** a new car soon.*
- *Jack says he’**s going to phone** this evening.*
- *When **are you going to get** your hair cut?*
- *I’**m going to keep** asking her out until she says ‘Yes’.*
- *I’**m going to stop** him reading my emails if it’s the last thing I do.*

## Things that are on the way: *She’s going to have a baby.*

Another use of the *going-to* structure is to predict the future on the basis of present evidence – to say that a future action or event is on the way, or starting to happen.

- *Sandra’**s going to have** another baby in June.*
- *Look at the sky. It’**s going to rain**.*
- *Look out! We’**re going to crash**!*

## Commands and refusals

*Going to* … can be used to insist that people do things or do not do things.

- *You’**re going to finish** that soup if you sit there all afternoon!*
- *She’**s going to take** that medicine whether she likes it or not!*
- *You’**re not going to play** football in my garden.*

It is also used in emphatic refusals.

- *I’**m not going to sit up** all night listening to your problems!*

## *gonna*

In informal speech, *going to* is often pronounced /gənə/. This is sometimes shown in writing as *gonna*, especially in American English.

- *Nobody’s **gonna** talk to me like that.*
