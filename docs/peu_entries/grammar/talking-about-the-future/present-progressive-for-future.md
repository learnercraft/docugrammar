# Present progressive for future

## Present reality: *I’m washing my hair this evening.*

We use the present progressive for future actions and events that have some present reality. It is most common in discussions of personal arrangements and fixed plans, when the time and place have been decided.

- *‘What **are** you **doing** this evening?’ ‘I’**m washing** my hair.’*
- *I’**m seeing** Larry on Saturday.*
- *Did you know I’**m getting** a new job?*
- *We’**re touring** Mexico next summer.*
- *What **are** we **having** for dinner?*
- *My car’**s going** in for repairs next week.*

We often use the present progressive with verbs of movement, to talk about actions which are just starting.

- ***Are** you **coming** to the pub?*
- *I’**m** just **going** next door. Back in a minute.*
- *Get your coat on! I’**m taking** you down to the doctor!*

Note that the simple present is not often used to talk about the future (but [(see here)](./simple-present-for-future).

- *What **are** you **doing** this evening?* (not *~~What do you do this evening?~~*)

## Present progressive and *going to …*: differences

In many cases, both structures can be used to express the same idea.

- *I’**m washing** / **going to wash** my hair this evening.*

But there are some differences. For example, we prefer *going to …* when we are talking not about fixed arrangements, but about intentions and decisions. Compare:

- *I’**m seeing** Jake tonight.* (emphasis on arrangement)  
  *I’**m** really **going to tell** him what I think of him.* (emphasis on intention: not *~~I’m really telling him …~~*)
- *Who’**s cooking** lunch?* (asking what has been arranged)  
  *Who’**s going to cook** lunch?* (asking for a decision)
  
Because the present progressive is used especially for personal arrangements, it is not generally used to make predictions about events that are outside people’s control.

- *It’**s going to snow** before long.* (not *~~It’s snowing before long.~~*)
- *I can see that things **are going to get** better soon.* (not *~~… things are getting better soon.~~*)

And the present progressive is used for actions and events, but not usually for permanent states. Compare:

- *Our house **is getting / is going to get** new windows this winter.*
- *Their new house **is going to look** over the river.* (not *~~Their new house is looking over the river.~~*)

## Commands and refusals

The present progressive can be used to insist that people do things or do not do things.

- *She’**s taking** that medicine whether she likes it or not!*
- *You’**re not wearing** that skirt to school.*

The present progressive is common in emphatic refusals.

- *I’m sorry – you’**re not taking** my car.*
- *I’**m not washing** your socks – forget it!*
