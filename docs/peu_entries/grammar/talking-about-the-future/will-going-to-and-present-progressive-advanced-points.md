# *will*, *going to* and present progressive: advanced points

*Will* is the basic structure for talking about the future. We use *will* if there is not a good reason for using present forms.

## Present reality

We prefer present forms (present progressive or *going to …*) when we are talking about future events that have some present reality ([(see here)](./going-to). In other cases we use *will*. Compare:

- *I’**m seeing** Jessica on Tuesday.* (The arrangement exists now.)  
  *I wonder if she’**ll recognise** me.* (not talking about the present)
- *We’**re going to get** a new car.* (The decision already exists.)  
  *I hope it **will be** better than the last one.* (not talking about the present)

## Predictions: thinking and guessing about the future

In predictions, we use *going to* when we have outside evidence for what we say – for example black clouds in the sky, a person who is obviously about to fall.

- *See those clouds? It’**s going to rain**.* (not *~~See those clouds? It will rain.~~*)
- *Look – that kid’**s going to fall** off his bike.* (not *~~Look! That kid’ll fall off his bike.~~*)

We prefer *will* for predictions when there is not such obvious outside evidence – when we are talking more about what is inside our heads: what we know, or believe, or have calculated. (When we use *will*, we are not showing the listener something; we are asking him or her to believe something.) Compare:

- *Look out – we’**re going to** crash!* (There is outside evidence.)  
  *Don’t lend him your car. He’s a terrible driver – he’**ll crash it**.* (the speaker’s knowledge)
- *I’ve just heard from the builder. That roof repair’**s going to cost** £7,000.* (outside evidence – the builder’s letter)  
  *I reckon it’**ll cost** about £3,000 to put in new lights.* (the speaker’s opinion)
- *Alice **is going to have** a baby.* (outside evidence – she is pregnant now)  
  *The baby **will** certainly **have** blue eyes, because both parents have.* (speaker’s knowledge about genetics)

## *will* and present forms: both possible

The differences between the structures used to talk about the future are not always very clear-cut. *Will* and present forms (especially *going to …*) are often both possible in the same situation, if ‘present’ ideas like intention or fixed arrangement are a part of the meaning, but not very important. The choice can depend on which aspect we wish to emphasise.

- *What **will** you **do** next year?* (open question about the future; perhaps no clear plans have been made)  
  *What **are** you **doing** next year?* (emphasis on fixed arrangements)  
  *What are you **going to do** next year?* (emphasis on intentions)
- *All the family **will be** there.*  
  *All the family **are going to be** there.*
- *If your mother comes, you’**ll have** to help with the cooking.*  
  *If your mother comes, you’**re going to have** to help with the cooking.*
- *You **won’t believe** this.*  
  *You’**re not going to believe** this.*
- *Next year **will be** different.*  
  *Next year **is going to be** different.*
- *Jack **will explain** everything to you.*  
  *Jack’**s going to explain** everything to you.*

Both *going to …* [(see here)](./going-to) and stressed *will* [(see here)](./../modal-auxiliary-verbs/willingness-will-can#announcing-decisions-i-ll-answer-it) can express a strong intention or determination.

- *I’**m** really **going to stop** smoking!*
- *I really **will stop** smoking!*

In cases like these, the different forms are all correct, and it is unimportant which one is chosen.

## Official arrangements: *The Princess will meet the President at 14.30.*

*Will* is often used, rather than present forms, in giving information about impersonal, fixed arrangements – for example official itineraries. Compare:

- *We’**re meeting** Sandra at 6.00.*
- *The Princess **will arrive** at the airport at 14.00. She **will meet** the President at 14.30, and **will then** attend a performance of traditional dances.*

## Predictions as orders: *The regiment will attack at dawn.*

Predictions can be used as a way of giving orders – instead of telling somebody to do something, the speaker just says firmly that it will happen. This is common in military-style orders.

- *The regiment **will attack** at dawn.*
- *You **will start** work at six o’clock sharp.*

## Different meanings of *will you …?*

With a verb referring to a state, *will you …?* asks for information.

- *How soon **will you know** your travel dates?*
- ***Will you be** here next week?*

With a verb referring to an action, *will you …?* usually introduces an order or request [(see here)](./../modal-auxiliary-verbs/instructions-and-requests-will-would-can-could-might-shall#instructions-requests-and-suggestions-will-would-can-could-might).

- ***Will you turn off** that music!*
- ***Will you do** the shopping this afternoon, please?*

To ask for information about planned actions, we use a present form ( [(see here)](./going-to) or the future progressive [(see here)](./future-progressive).

- *When **are** you **going to see** Andy?*
- ***Are** you **doing** the shopping this afternoon?*
- ***Will** you **be doing** the shopping …?*

## Expressing certainty about the present or past

We can use *will* to talk about the present – to say what we think is very probably or certainly the case.

- *‘There’s somebody at the door.’ ‘That’**ll be** the electrician.’*
- *Don’t phone them now – they’**ll be having** dinner.*

*Will have …* can express similar ideas about the past.

- *As you **will have noticed**, there is a new secretary in the front office.*
- *It’s no use expecting Barry to turn up. He’**ll have forgotten**.*

## Obligation: *shall*

In contracts and other legal documents, *shall* is often used with third-person subjects to refer to obligations and duties, in both British and American English.

- *The hirer **shall be** responsible for maintenance of the vehicle.*

In normal usage, we prefer *will*, *must* or *should* to express ideas of this kind.
