# American and British English

Standard American English (‘General American’) and standard British English are very similar. There are a few differences in the use of structures and in spelling rules, and rather more differences of vocabulary and idiom. Modern British English is heavily influenced by American English, so some contrasts are disappearing. Pronunciation is sometimes very different, but most American and British speakers can understand each other easily.

An excellent, very detailed guide to grammatical differences, particularly differences in the grammar of individual words, is John Algeo’s *British or American English?* (Cambridge University Press, 2006).

Note that the term ‘American English’ is used here for the standard English of the United States, but that some of the statements apply more widely to North American English in general.

## Grammar: *I’ve never gotten …* / *I’ve never got …*

Here are examples of the most important differences. Some other differences are dealt with in other entries. In many cases, two different forms are possible in one variety of English, while only one of the forms is possible or normal in the other variety.

## Vocabulary: *sidewalk*/*pavement*

There are very many differences. Sometimes the same word has different meanings (BrE *mad* = crazy; AmE *mad* = angry). And very often, different words are used for the same idea (BrE *lorry* = AmE *truck*). Here are a few examples, with very brief information about the words and their meanings. A very useful guide to vocabulary differences is *Mighty Fine Words and Smashing Expressions – Making Sense of Transatlantic English*, edited by Orin Hargraves, Oxford University Press.

## Spelling: *color*/*colour*

A number of words end in *\-or* in American English and *\-our* in British English (e.g. *color/colour*). Some words end in *\-er* in American English and *\-re* in British English (e.g. *center/centre*). Many verbs which end in *\-ize* in American English (e.g. *realize*) can be spelt in British English with *\-ise* or *\-ize* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-formation-and-spelling/ise-and-ize). Some of the commonest words with different forms are:

## Pronunciation

There are, of course, many different regional accents in both Britain and America. The most important general differences between American and British speech are as follows:

1. Certain vowels are nasal (pronounced through the nose and mouth at the same time) in some varieties of American English, but not in most British accents.
2. British English has one more vowel than American English. This is the rounded short *o* (/ɒ/) used in words like *cot*, *dog*, *got*, *gone*, *off*, *stop*, *lost*. In American English these words are pronounced either with /ɑː/, like the first vowel in *father*, or with /ɔː/, like the vowel in *caught*. (This vowel is also pronounced rather differently in British and American English.)
3. Some words written with *a* + consonant (e.g. *fast*, *after*) have different pronunciations: with /ɑː/ in standard southern British English, and with /æ/ in American and some other varieties of English.
4. The vowel in *home*, *go*, *open* is pronounced /əʊ/ in standard southern British English, and /oʊ/ in American English. The two vowels sound very different.
5. In standard southern British English, *r* is only pronounced before a vowel sound. In most kinds of American English (and most other British varieties), *r* is pronounced in all positions where it is written in a word, and it changes the quality of a vowel that comes before it. So words like *car*, *turn*, *offer* sound very different in British and American speech.
6. In many varieties of American English, *t* and *d* both have a very light voiced pronunciation (/d/) between vowels – so *writer* and *rider*, for example, can sound the same. In British English they are quite different: /ˈraɪtə(r)/ and /ˈraɪdə(r)/.
7. Some words which are pronounced with /uː/ in most varieties of American English have /juː/ in British English. These are words in which *th*, *d*, *t* or *n* (and sometimes *s* or *l*) are followed by *u* or *ew* in writing.

    - *enthusiastic*: AmE /ɪnˌθuːziˈæstɪk/ - BrE /ɪnˌθjuːziˈæstɪk/
    - *duty*: AmE /ˈduːti/ - BrE /ˈdjuːti/
    - *tune*: AmE /tuːn/ - BrE /tjuːn/
    - *new*: AmE /nuː/ - BrE /njuː/
8. Words ending in unstressed *\-ile* (e.g. *fertile*, *missile*) are pronounced with /aɪl/ in British English; some are pronounced with /l/ in American English.

    - *fertile*: AmE /ˈfɜːrtl/ (rhyming with *turtle*) - BrE /ˈfɜːtaɪl/ (rhyming with *her tile*)
9. Some long words ending in *\-ary*, *\-ery* or *\-ory* are pronounced differently, with one more syllable in American English.

    - *secretary*: AmE /ˈsekrəteri/ - BrE /ˈsekrətri/
10. *Borough* and *thorough* are pronounced differently.

    - *AmE* /ˈbʌroʊ, ˈθʌroʊ/
    - *BrE* /ˈbʌrə, ˈθʌrə/
11. Words borrowed from French are often stressed differently, especially if their pronunciation ends with a vowel sound. The final vowel is usually stressed in American English but not in British English.

    - *pâté*: AmE /pɑːˈteɪ/ - BrE /ˈpæteɪ/
    - *ballet*: AmE /bæˈleɪ/ - BrE /ˈbæleɪ/
