## Notes

- Note the standard AmE pronunciations of *ate* (/eɪt/) and *shone* (/ʃoʊn/). /et/ for *ate* is substandard in AmE (but a standard variant in BrE).
- *Burn*, *dream*, *kneel*, *lean*, *learn*, *smell*, *spell*, *spill* and *spoil* are all generally regular in American English. In British English, irregular past tenses and participles with *-t* are also quite common.
- *Dive* is regular in British English, but can be irregular in American:  
  *dive* — *dived/dove (*/doʊv/*)* — *dived*
- The old past participle *drunken* is used as an adjective in some expressions (e.g. *a drunken argument*, *drunken driving*), but these are not very common.
- *Fit* and *quit* are usually irregular in American English.  
  *fit* — *fit* — *fit*, *quit* — *quit* — *quit*
- The American past participle of *get* is either *got* or *gotten* [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/get-basic-structures-and-meanings#got-and-gotten).
- *Hang* is regular when used to mean 'execute by hanging'.
- *Prove* (regular) has an irregular past participle *proven* which is sometimes used instead of *proved*, especially as an adjective (e.g. *a proven liar*).
- *Says* is pronounced /sez/.
- *Speed* can also have regular forms, especially in the expression *speeded up*.
- *Spit* has both *spit* and *spat* as past tense and participle in American English.
- *Sung* and *sunk* are sometimes used instead of *sang* and *sank*.
