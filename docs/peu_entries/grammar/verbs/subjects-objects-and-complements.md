# Subjects, objects and complements

## Subjects

The **subject** of a verb is a noun phrase, noun or pronoun that comes before it in a statement. Often the subject indicates the **agent**—the person or thing that causes the action of the verb.

- ***My brother*** *gave me this.*
- ***Rain*** *stopped play.*
- ***You*** *woke me up.*

But the subject can also, for example, indicate the receiver or experiencer of an action—it depends on the verb.

- *All the soldiers **got** medals.*
- *I **saw** the accident.*

Subjects cannot normally be dropped.

- not *~~He has changed his plans; will arrive tomorrow.~~*
- not *~~Is raining.~~*

For special structures in which it is possible to drop subjects, [(see here)](../basic-clause-types/imperatives), [(see here)](./../information-structure/ellipsis-leaving-words-out-introduction).

## Transitive and intransitive verbs

Some verbs are usually followed by nouns, noun phrases or pronouns that act as **direct objects**. These typically show who or what is affected by the action of the verb. In grammars they are called ‘**transitive**’. Examples are *invite*, *surprise*.

- *Let’s **invite Sophie and Bruce**.* (but not *~~Let’s invite.~~*)
- *You **surprised me**.* (but not *~~You surprised.~~*)

Some verbs are not normally followed by direct objects. These are called ‘**intransitive**’. Examples are *sit*, *sleep*.

- *Do **sit** down.* (but not *~~Do sit that chair~~.*)
- *I usually **sleep** well.* (but not *~~She slept the baby.~~*)

Many verbs can be both transitive and intransitive. Compare:

- *England **lost the match**.*  
  *England **lost**.*
- *I can’t **eat this**.*  
  *Let’s **eat**.*

Some transitive verbs can be followed by two objects (indirect and direct). For details, [see here](./verbs-with-two-objects).

- *I’ll **send you the form** tomorrow.*
- *I’m going to **buy Sarah some flowers**.*

Some verbs are used transitively and intransitively with different kinds of subject; the intransitive use has a meaning rather like a passive [(see here)](./../pronouns/reflexive-pronouns-myself-etc) verb. Compare:

- *She **opened the door**.*  
  *The door **opened**.*
- *The wind’s **moving the curtain**.*  
  *The curtain’s **moving**.*

Some transitive verbs can be followed by an object together with an object complement (an expression that gives more information about the object). For details, [see here](./verb-object-complement-you-make-me-nervous).

- *You **make me nervous**.*
- *Let’s **paint it blue**.*

## Complements of place

Usually, a preposition is necessary before an expression of place.

- *She **arrived at the station** last night.* (not *~~She arrived the station~~ ...*)
- *Don’t **walk on the grass**.* (not *~~Don’t walk the grass.~~*)

A few verbs can be used with direct objects referring to place.

- *I like **climbing mountains**.* (not *~~I like climbing on mountains.~~*)

Some verbs are incomplete without an expression of place.

- *He **lives in York**.* (but not *~~He lives~~.*)

## Linking verbs

Some verbs are followed not by an object, but by a subject complement—an expression which describes the subject. These are called ‘**linking verbs**’. For details, [see here](./linking-verbs-be-seem-look-etc).

- *Your room **is a mess**.*
- *That **looks nice**.*
- *The bathroom **is upstairs**.*
- *I **felt a complete idiot**.*
