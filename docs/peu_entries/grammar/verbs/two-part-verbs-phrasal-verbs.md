# Two-part verbs: phrasal verbs

## verb + adverb particle: *get back*, *walk out*

Many English verbs can be followed by small adverbs (‘**adverb particles**’). These two-part verbs are often called ‘**phrasal verbs**’.

- ***Get back**!*
- *She **walked out**.*
- *I **switched** the light **off**.*

Common adverb particles: *about*, *across*, *ahead*, *along*, *(a)round*, *aside*, *away*, *back*, *by*, *down*, *forward*, *in*, *home*, *off*, *on*, *out*, *over*, *past*, *through*, *up*.

Some of these words can also be used as prepositions. Compare:

- *I switched the light **off**.* (adverb particle)  
  *I jumped **off** the wall.* (preposition)

## Idiomatic meanings: *break out*; *turn up*

The meaning of a phrasal verb is often very different from the meanings of the two parts taken separately.

- *War **broke out** in 1939.* (*Broke out* is not the same as *broke + out*.)
- *Joe **turned up** last night.* (= ‘appeared’—not the same as *turned + up*.)
- *I **looked** the word **up** in the dictionary.* (*Look up* is not the same as *look + up*.)
- *We **put off** the meeting till Tuesday.* (*Put off* is not the same as *put + off*.)

## Phrasal verbs with and without objects

Some phrasal verbs are intransitive (they do not have objects).

- *I **got up** at 7.00 today.*
- *That colour really **stands out**.*

Others are transitive.

- *Could you **switch the light off**?*
- *I helped Anna to **clean up the room**.*

## Word order with objects

Adverb particles can go either before or after noun objects (unlike most adverbs). [(see here)](../adverbs-and-adverbials/position-of-adverbials-introduction#verb-and-object-she-speaks-english-well)

- *She switched **off the light**.* or *She switched **the light off**.*

But they can only go after pronoun objects.

- *She switched **it off**.* (not *~~She switched off it~~.*)
- *Is that the light **which** you switched **off**?* (not *... ~~the light off which you switched?~~*)
- *Give **me back** my watch.* or *Give **me** my watch **back**.* (not *~~Give back me my watch~~.*)
