# verb + object + complement: *You make me nervous.*

## Adjective and noun complements

Some transitive verbs can be followed by an object together with an object complement (an expression that gives more information about the object). This is often an adjective or noun phrase.

- *You make **me nervous**.*
- *She’s driving **us crazy**.*
- *Let’s paint **it blue**.*
- *I find **her attitude strange**.*
- *Don’t call **me a liar**.*
- *I don’t know why they elected **him President**.*
- ‘*Would you like to join the committee?*’ ‘*I would consider **it an honour**.*’

A complement may come before a long and heavy object. Compare:

- *He painted **the wall red**.* (not *~~He painted red the wall.~~*)
- *He painted **red the walls, the window frames and the ceiling**.*

## *I see you as ...*

After some verbs, an object complement is introduced by *as*. This is common when we say how we see or describe somebody/something.

- *I **see** you **as** a basically kind person.*
- *She **described** her attacker **as** a tall dark man with a beard.*
- *His mother **regards** him **as** a genius.*
- *After tests, they **identified** the metal **as** gold.*

The structure is also possible with *as being*.

- *The police do not regard him **as (being)** dangerous.*

## *I considered him to be ...*

Some verbs that refer to thoughts, feelings and opinions (e.g. *believe*, *consider*, *feel*, *know*, *find*, *understand*) can be followed by **object + infinitive** (usually *to be*) in a formal style. In an informal style, *that*-clauses are more common.

- *I **considered him to be** an excellent choice.* (Less formal: *I considered that he was an excellent choice.*)
- *We **supposed them to be** married.* (Less formal: *We supposed that they were married.*)
- *They **believed her to be** reliable.* (Less formal: *They believed that she was reliable.*)

This structure is very unusual with *think*.

- *I **thought that** she was mistaken.* (More natural than *I thought her to be mistaken.*)

*To be* can be dropped after *consider*.

- *I **considered him (to be)** an excellent choice.*

Passive forms of these structures may be less formal than active forms [(see here)](#passive-structures).

For more details of structures with *feel*, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/feel); for *know*, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/know); for *think*, [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-problems-from-a-to-z/think).

## *They found her (to be) ...*

After ***find* + object**, *to be* suggests the result of a test or investigation. Compare:

- *Everybody **found her very pleasant**.*  
  *The doctors **found her to be perfectly fit**.*
- *I **found the bicycle very comfortable** to ride.*  
  *The testers **found this bicycle to be the best** value for money.*

## Introductory *it*: *She made it clear that ...*

When the object of a verb is a clause, infinitive structure or *-ing* structure, and there is an object complement, it is common to use *it* as a preparatory object. Compare:

- *She made **her views clear**.*  
  *She made **it clear that** she disagreed.* (not *~~She made that she disagreed clear.~~*)

For details of this structure, [(see here)](./../information-structure/preparatory-it-object).

## Passive structures

Passive versions of these structures are common [(see here)](./../passives/he-was-considered-a-genius).

- *It **was painted** blue.*
- *He **was elected** President.*
- *Her attacker **was described** as a tall man with a beard.*
- *The metal **was identified** as gold.*
- *He **is not regarded** as being dangerous.*
- *For a long time he **was thought** to be a spy.*
- *She **was believed** to belong to a revolutionary organisation.*
- *Seven people **are understood** to have been injured in the explosion.*
- *It **was considered** impossible to change the date.*
