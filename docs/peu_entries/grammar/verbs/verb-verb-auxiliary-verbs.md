# verb + verb: auxiliary verbs

## The need for auxiliary verbs

In English sentences, a lot of important meanings are expressed by the verb phrase—for example questioning, negation, time, completion, continuation, repetition, willingness, possibility, obligation. But English verbs do not have many different one-word forms: the maximum (except for *be*) is five (e.g. *see*, *sees*, *seeing*, *saw*, *seen*). So to express all these meanings, ‘auxiliary’ (or ‘helping’) verbs are added to other verbs. There are two groups.

## *be*, *do* and *have*

*Be* is added to other verbs to make progressive and passive forms.

- ***Is*** *it raining?*
- *She **was** imprisoned by a military court.*

*Do* is used to make questions, negatives and emphatic forms of non-auxiliary verbs.

- ***Do*** *you smoke?*
- *It **didn’t** matter.*
- ***Do*** *come in.*

*Have* is used to make perfect forms.

- *What **have** you done?*
- *I realised that I **hadn’t** turned the lights off.*

For details, see [*be, have and do*](../be-have-and-do/be-have-and-do-introduction).

## Modal auxiliary verbs

The verbs *will*, *shall*, *would*, *should*, *can*, *could*, *may*, *might*, *must* and *ought* are usually called ‘**modal auxiliary verbs**’. They are used with other verbs to add various meanings, mostly to do with certainty or obligation.

- *She **may** be in Mexico.*
- *You **must** call Uncle Arthur.*

For details, [*Modal auxiliary verbs*](../modal-auxiliary-verbs/modal-auxiliary-verbs-introduction).

## Other verb + verb structures

Other verbs (e.g. *seem*) which are used in **verb + verb** structures are not usually called ‘auxiliary verbs’. One important difference is grammatical. In auxiliary verb structures, questions and negatives are made without *do*; in other **verb + verb** structures the auxiliary *do* has to be added to the first verb. Compare:

- *She should understand.*  
  ***Should she*** *understand?*
- *She seems to understand.*  
  ***Does she seem*** *to understand?*
- *He is swimming.*  
  *He **is not** swimming*
- *He likes swimming.*  
  *He **doesn’t like** swimming.*
