# verb + verb: other structures

## Infinitives, *-ing* forms and clauses

Many verbs besides auxiliaries can be followed by forms of other verbs (or by structures including other verbs). This can happen, for example, if we talk about our attitude to an action: the first verb describes the attitude and the second refers to the action. The second verb structure is often rather like the direct object of the first verb.

- *I **hope to see** you soon.*
- *I **enjoy playing** cards.*
- *I **saw that she was crying**.*

Different structures are possible, depending on the particular verb. Some verbs can be followed by infinitives with or without *to* ([(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/infinitives-after-verbs-it-s-beginning-to-rain), some verbs can be followed by *-ing* forms with or without a preposition [(see here)](./../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/ing-forms-after-verbs-i-enjoy-travelling), and some by clauses. Many verbs can be followed by more than one of these structures, often with a difference of meaning or use. For each verb, it is necessary to know which structures are possible.

- *We **seem to have** a problem.* (not *~~We seem having a problem~~.*)
- *Can I **help wash** the dishes?*
- *It’s not very easy to **stop smoking**.* (not *... ~~to stop to smoke~~.*)
- *We’re **thinking of moving**.* (not *~~We’re thinking to move.~~*)
- *I **suggest that you see** a solicitor.* or *I **suggest seeing** a solicitor.* (not *~~I suggest you to see a solicitor.~~*)

Sometimes the first verb does not give information about the subject—it says more about the action which the second verb refers to.

- *I **happened to see** Alice the other day.*
- *We’re **starting to get invited** to some of the neighbours’ parties.*
- *My keys **seem to have disappeared**.*

It is possible to have ‘chains’ of verbs following each other.

- *I **keep forgetting to go** shopping.*
- *Don’t **let** me **stop** you **working**.*
- *He **seems to be trying to sit up**.*
- *I don’t **want to have to get** her **to start telling** lies.*

## verb + object + verb

Many verbs can be followed by an object as well as a verb structure.

- *I’d like **you to meet** Sophie.*
- *We all want **you to be** happy.* (not *~~We all want that you are happy.~~*)
- *We’ve got to **stop him making** a fool of himself.*
- *When are you going to **get the clock repaired**?*
- *Nobody **told me that you were here**.*
