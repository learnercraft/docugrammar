# Introduction

## Forms

**Verbs** are the central element in sentences. Most of the things we say are built around them. English verbs have up to five one-word forms (except *be*, which has eight). These are:

- the **base form**: the one found in dictionaries, for example *go*, *write*, *play*. This is used for **present tense** forms after *I*, *we*, *you* (singular and plural) and *they*, in **infinitives**, and in **imperatives**.
  - *We **go** skating on Saturdays.*
  - *I must **write** to Laura.*
  - *Please **play** something.*
- the **third person singular present**, for example *goes*, *writes*, *plays*
- the **past tense**, for example *went*, *wrote*, *played*
- the **past participle**, for example *gone*, *written*, *played*. Note that in **regular** verbs the past participle is the same as the past tense.
- the ***\-ing*** form, for example *going*, *writing*, *playing*. Depending on how it is used, the *\-ing* form may be called a ‘**present participle**’ or a ‘**gerund**’ [(see here)](../infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles/ing-forms-introduction#participles-and-gerunds).

Verb forms which show time (e.g. *goes*, *went*) are often called **finite** in grammars; other forms (e.g. *written*, *playing*) are **non-finite**.

## Tenses

**Tenses** are verb forms that show the time of actions and situations, either as single words or including auxiliary verbs (see below).

- *We **went** home.* (simple past tense)
- ***Have*** *you **written** to Jamie?* (present perfect tense)

For a list of **active** tenses, [(see here)](./../passives/passive-structures-and-verb-forms).

## Auxiliary verbs

**Auxiliary** (‘helping’) verbs are used with other verbs to add various kinds of meaning. *Be*, *have* and *do* help to make progressive (or ‘continuous’) and perfect structures, questions and negatives (see below and [*be, have and do*](../be-have-and-do/be-have-and-do-introduction)).

**Modal auxiliary verbs** (*must*, *can*, *could*, *will*, *would*, *may*, *might*, *shall*, *should* and *ought*) are used with other verbs to add ideas such as futurity, certainty, probability, obligation and permission. For details, [*Modal auxiliary verbs*](../modal-auxiliary-verbs/modal-auxiliary-verbs-introduction).

## What can follow a verb?

Different non-auxiliary verbs can be followed by different kinds of words and structures. This is partly a matter of meaning: after a verb like *eat* or *break*, for instance, it is normal to expect a noun; after *try* or *stop*, it is natural to expect a verb. It is also partly a matter of grammatical rules that have nothing to do with meaning. Before an object, *wait* is followed by *for*; *expect* has no preposition. One can *tell somebody something*, but one cannot ~~explain somebody something~~. One *hopes to see somebody*, but one *looks forward to seeing somebody*. One *advises somebody to see the doctor*, but one does not ~~suggest somebody to see the doctor~~. One *thinks that something will happen*, but one does not ~~want that it will happen~~. Unfortunately, there are no simple rules in this area; it is necessary to learn, for each verb, what kind of structures can follow it. A good dictionary will normally give this information.
