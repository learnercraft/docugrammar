# Verbs with two objects

## Indirect and direct objects: *I gave Jack the keys.*

Many verbs can have two objects—usually a person and a thing. This often happens with verbs that are used to talk about transferring or communicating things from one person to another, or doing things for somebody. A few other verbs are also used in this way. Common examples:

- *bet*
- *bring*
- *build*
- *buy*
- *cost*
- *get*
- *give*
- *leave*
- *lend*
- *make*
- *offer*
- *owe*
- *pass*
- *pay*
- *play*
- *post*
- *promise*
- *read*
- *refuse*
- *sell*
- *send*
- *show*
- *sing*
- *take*
- *teach*
- *tell*
- *throw*
- *wish*
- *write*

The thing that is given, sent, bought, etc is called the '**direct object**'; the person who gets it is the '**indirect object**'. Most often, the indirect object comes first.

- *I bet **you ten dollars** you can't beat me at chess.*
- *He built **the children a tree house**.*
- *Shall I buy **you some chocolate** while I'm out?*
- *Could you bring **me the paper**?*
- *The repair cost **me a lot**.*
- *I gave **Jack the keys**.*
- *If you're going upstairs, could you get **me my coat**?*
- *He left **his children nothing** when he died.*
- *Lend **me your bike**, can you?*
- *I'll make **you a cake** tomorrow.*
- *I owe **my sister a lot of money**.*
- *Can I play **you some relaxing music**?*
- *I'll send **her the report** tomorrow.*
- *They promised **me all sorts of things**.*
- *Daddy, read **me a story**.*
- *He sent **his mother a postcard**.*
- *Let's take **her some flowers**.*
- *Will you teach **me poker**?*
- *We bought **the children pizzas**.*
- *Throw me **the ball**.*
- *We wish **you a Merry Christmas**.*

Not all verbs with this kind of meaning can be used like this [(see here)](#structures-withdonatepushcarryexplainsuggestdescribeandtake).

## Indirect object last: *I gave the keys to Jack.*

We can also put the indirect object after the direct object. In this case it normally has a preposition (usually *to* or *for*).*I gave the keys **to Jack**.*

- *I handed my licence **to the police officer**.*
- *Mrs Norman sent some flowers **to the nurse**.*
- *Mother bought the ice cream **for you**, not **for me**.*

(Not all grammars call these prepositional phrases 'indirect objects'.)

## Two pronouns: *Lend them to her.*

When both objects are pronouns, it is common to put the indirect object last. *To* is occasionally dropped after *it* in informal British English.

- *Lend them **to her**.*
- *Send some **to him**.*
- *Give it **(to) me**.*

It is also possible to put the indirect object first.

- *Give **her** one.*
- *Send **him** some.*

However, this structure is avoided in some cases: phrases ending with *it* or *them* (e.g. *He gave you it* or *Send them them*) are often felt to be unnatural.

## *wh*-questions: *Who did you buy it for?*

Prepositions are used in *wh*-questions referring to the indirect object.

- *Who did you buy it **for**?* (not *~~Who did you buy it?~~*)
- *Who was it sent **to**?* (not *~~Who was it sent?~~*)

## Passives: *I've been given a picture.*

When these verbs are used in passive structures, the subject is usually the person who receives something, not the thing which is sent, given, etc.

- ***I***'*ve just been given a lovely picture.*
- ***We*** *were all bought little presents.*

However, the thing which is given, sent, etc can be the subject if necessary.

'*What happened to the stuff he left behind?*' '*Well, **the picture** was given to Mr Ferguson.*'

## Structures with *donate*, *push*, *carry*, *explain*, *suggest*, *describe* and *take*

Not all verbs that refer to transferring or communicating can be followed by **indirect object + direct object**. The structure is not possible, for example, with *donate*, *push*, *carry*, *explain*, *suggest* or *describe*.

- *They donated **money to the museum**.* (but not *~~They donated the museum money.~~*)
- *I pushed **the plate to Anna**.* (but not *~~I pushed Anna the plate.~~*)
- *He carried **the baby to the doctor**.* (but not *~~He carried the doctor the baby.~~*)
- *I'd like him to explain **his decision to us**.* (but not *... ~~to explain us his decision.~~*)
- *Can you suggest **a good dentist to me**?* (but not *~~Can you suggest me a good dentist?~~*)
- *Please **describe your wife to us**.* (but not *~~Please describe us your wife.~~*)
- *Take* can be used with **indirect object + direct object** when it means 'take to' but not 'take from'.
- *I **took her some money**.* (= I took some money to her—not ... from her.)

## One object or two

Some verbs can be followed by either a direct object, or an indirect object, or both.

- *I asked **Jack**.*
- *I asked **a question**.*
- *I asked **Jack a question**.*

Other verbs like this include *teach*, *tell*, *pay*, *show*, *sing*, *play* and *write*. Note that when *sing*, *play* and *write* have no direct object, we put *to* before the indirect object. Compare:

- *Sing **her** a song.*
- ***Write me*** *a letter.*
- *Sing **to her**.* (not *~~Sing her.~~*)
- *Write **to me** when you get home.* (More common than *Write me when* ... in standard British English.)
