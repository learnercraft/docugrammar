# Academic writing

The writing found in academic journals and similar contexts (for example research reports, theoretical discussion and debate, historical accounts) is normally formal in tone, and follows the conventions of formal writing discussed in other parts of this Section. In particular:

## Vocabulary

Informal wording is usually avoided. Contractions are not used, and ‘general-purpose’ words like *do*, *have* and *get* are replaced by more specific terminology.

- *Further research will be **carried out**.* (better than *… will be done*)
- *The team **experienced a number of** problems.* (better than *… had a lot of problems*)
- *Early investigators **obtained** ambiguous results.* (better than *… got ambiguous results*)

## Impersonal writing

Academic writing is most often impersonal, so for example the authors or researchers may not often appear as subjects of sentences.

- ***This report questions** the conclusions of earlier researchers.* (rather than *We question …*)

Passives are common.

- *All well-dated Neanderthal sites **have been found** to be at least 39,000 years old.*

Impersonal structures with it are frequently used.

- ***It** is clear that …*
- ***It** is likely that …*
- ***It** is important to …*

And academic writers may avoid presenting over-definite conclusions, by using verbs such as *may*, *suggest*, or adjectives such as *possible*, *arguable*.

- *Preliminary results **suggest** that …*
- *It is **possible** that …*

## Nominalisation

Nominalisation (expressing actions by nouns, [(see here)](./reading-complicated-structures#nominalisation-and-coordination-daniels-failure) can help to make writing impersonal.

- ***The discovery of penicillin** transformed the treatment of bacterial infections.* (rather than *When Fleming discovered penicillin …*)
- ***Chemical analysis of their** bones shows that their diets differed from those of modern humans.*

## Pre- and post-modifiers

Complex noun phrases may be used to package information, with several pre-modifiers and/or post-modifiers ( [(see here)](./reading-complicated-structures#complex-noun-phrases-premodification).

- ***accelerating climate** change*
- ***important survival** information*
- *a **clear evolutionary** pathway*
- ***ongoing hydrothermal** activity*
- *the divergence **of the species from its apelike cousins***
- *laws **of motion and gravitation that connected everything in the cosmos***
- *evidence **for the way in which mirror cells work***
- ***brain** areas **associated with reward***
- ***chemical** reactions **between rock and water***

## Discourse markers

Academic writers use discourse markers [(see here)](./discourse-markers-in-writing) to make the structure of their text clear, for instance by signalling points which add to or contrast with what has come before.

- ***In addition**, MRI scans consistently showed tissue abnormalities.*
- *These results, **however**, must be regarded as provisional pending further investigation.*

Note the use of *furthermore* and *what is more* to strengthen an argument. Compare:

- *Participants completed tests of endurance. **In addition**, their lung capacity was measured.* (simply adding information)
- *A clear relationship was found between lung capacity and endurance. **Furthermore** / **What is more**, training which increased endurance was shown to have a positive effect on lung capacity.* (adding another piece of evidence for the writer’s claims)

Note also the use of *on the other hand* to emphasise a contrast. Compare:

- *Several studies have provided evidence that playing classical music to cows increases their milk yield. **However**, no similar studies to date have been carried out on goats.* (a different point, but not an emphatic contrast)
- *Playing classical music to cows has been shown to increase their milk production. Rock music, **on the other hand**, is found to result in significantly reduced yields.* (a more emphatic contrast)

## Collocations and formulaic language

Academic writing involves two kinds of formulaic language [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/vocabulary-areas/idioms-collocations-and-formulaic-expressions). One type consists of the fixed expressions that are commonly used in the particular area of study concerned, and which anyone writing academic material in that area needs to be familiar with.

- *to take a blood sample* (medicine)
- *to draw out / trace out a floor plan* (architecture)
- *communicative competence* (linguistics)

The other kind of fixed expressions are those that are used, in any subject of study, when discussing research, evaluating evidence, developing an argument, agreeing and disagreeing with published views, and so on. A few examples:

- *to conduct / carry out research*
- *to compile/analyse/present data*
- *to raise an issue*
- *to put forward / question / take issue with / challenge / contest / dismiss: a view / an argument / a theory / a hypothesis / a claim*
- *to make/reject a claim / an assumption*
- *to claim that …*
- *to assert that …*
- *to suggest that …*
- *to draw a conclusion*
- *to prove/disprove*
- *solid theoretical reasoning*
- *proof/evidence for/that*
- *powerful/persuasive/compelling evidence*
- *sound empirical evidence*
- *lack of evidence*
- *little evidence for …*
- *research findings*
- *a strong implication*
- *a logical conclusion*
- *on both theoretical and practical grounds*
- *based on unproved hypotheses*
- *broad agreement*
- *to take something into account*

English, like any language, contains a very large number of formulaic expressions. The most important thing for students of academic writing is to note, and learn, those that are commonly used for their subject matter, but to understand that they cannot realistically expect to master all of the formulaic vocabulary of English in a limited time.
