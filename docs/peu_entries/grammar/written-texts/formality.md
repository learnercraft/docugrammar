# Formality

## Formal and informal language

Most people speak and write in different ways on different occasions. In some languages, for example, there are very complicated rules about how to speak to older or more important people. English does not have a system of this kind. However, there are some words and structures which are mostly used in **formal** situations, when people are careful about how they express themselves: for example in official notices, business letters or reports, meetings or conferences, or polite conversations with strangers. And some words and structures are mostly used in **informal** situations: for example in conversations with friends, or emails to one’s family. Writing is more often formal, and speech is more often informal, but informal writing and formal speech are used when the situation makes them preferable.

- *Customer toilets are at the rear of the building.* (printed notice in an Oxfordshire petrol station)
- *The toilets are outside round the back.* (handwritten notice in the same petrol station, put up perhaps because the manager felt this would be easier for some of his customers to understand)

Most words and expressions are neither formal nor informal, but neutral – English speakers do not have to know two ways of saying everything.

## Grammar

Some grammatical structures have different formal and informal versions. For example, contracted auxiliary verbs and negatives [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-formation-and-spelling/contractions-i-ll-don-t-etc) are common in informal speech and writing. Compare:

- ``FORMAL:`` ***It has** gone. It **is not** possible.*
- ``INFORMAL:`` ***It’s** gone. It **isn’t** possible.*

Prepositions come at the end of certain structures in informal language [(see here)](./../prepositions/prepositions-at-the-ends-of-clauses). Compare:

- ``FORMAL:`` ***In** which century did he live?*
- ``INFORMAL:`` *Which century did he live **in**?*

Some relative structures are different [(see here)](./../relative-clauses/identifying-and-non-identifying-clauses-the-tall-man-who-mr-rogers-who). Compare:

- ``FORMAL:`` *The man **whom** she married …*
- ``INFORMAL:`` *The man she married …*

Some determiners are followed more often by singular verb forms in formal language, and by plural forms in informal language ( [(see here)](./../determiners-quantifiers/either#either-of), [(see here)](./../determiners-quantifiers/neither#neither-of--plural). Compare:

- ``FORMAL:`` *Neither of us **likes** him.*
- ``INFORMAL:`` *Neither of us **like** him.*

Subject and object forms of pronouns (e.g. *I* and *me*) are used differently in formal and informal language [(see here)](./../pronouns/personal-pronouns-advanced-points). Compare:

- ``FORMAL:`` *It was **she who** first saw what to do.*  
  ``INFORMAL:`` *It was **her that** first saw what to do.*
- ``FORMAL:`` ***Whom** did they elect?*  
  ``INFORMAL:`` ***Who** did they elect?*

Ellipsis (leaving out words, [(see here)](../information-structure/ellipsis-leaving-words-out-introduction) is more common in informal language. Compare:

- ``FORMAL:`` ***Have you seen** Mr Andrews?*  
  ``INFORMAL:`` ***Seen** Jack?*
- ``FORMAL:`` *We think **that** it is possible.*  
  ``INFORMAL:`` *We think it’s possible.*
