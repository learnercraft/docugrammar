# Linking with conjunctions and adverbials

## The difference

**Conjunctions** [(*Conjunctions, sentences and clauses*)](../conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses-introduction) make **grammatical** and **meaning** connections: they join clauses into sentences, and show the relationship between them. Some conjunctions:

*and, but, or, so, before, after, when, as soon as, because, since, although, if, that*When a conjunction comes between two clauses in writing, there is normally either **no punctuation** (if the clauses are short) or a **comma (,)** before the conjunction if they are longer.

- *The Minister paused briefly **before** he started to speak.*
- *The results were disappointing for the third year running, **so** it was decided to close three of the smaller branches.*

**Adverbials** can make **meaning** connections, but they do **not** make **grammatical** connections: they do not join clauses into sentences. Some adverbials:

*however, then, therefore, meanwhile, consequently, in fact, also, as a result, on the other hand, indeed*When an adverbial comes between two clauses, there is normally either a **full stop (.)** or a **semi-colon (;)** before it in careful writing, because the clauses are still grammatically separate.

- *The Minister paused briefly<strong>; then</strong> he started to speak.* (or *The Minister paused briefly<strong>. Then</strong> he started to speak.*)
- *The results were disappointing for the third year running<strong>; consequently</strong>, it was decided to close three of the smaller branches.* (or *The results were disappointing for the third year running<strong>. Consequently</strong>, it was decided to close three of the smaller branches.*)

## But and however

*But* is a **conjunction**; *however* is an **adverbial**. Note the difference in punctuation **before** these words.

- *It was cold<strong>, but</strong> it was pleasant.*
- *It was cold<strong>. However</strong>, it was pleasant. or It was cold<strong>; however</strong>, it was pleasant.* (better than *It was cold, however …*)

Note that we also put a comma **after** *however*.

## Position

Conjunctions always begin clauses. Adverbials can often go in different places in a clause (but not between the verb and the object). If an adverbial interrupts the normal word order of a clause, it may be separated by two commas.

- *He confessed to 114 murders, **but** the police did not believe his story.* (but not *~~… the police but did not believe his story.~~*)
- *He confessed to 114 murders; **however**, the police did not believe his story.*
- *He confessed to 114 murders; the police, **however**, did not believe his story.*
- *He confessed to 114 murders; the police did not, **however**, believe his story.*
- *He confessed to 114 murders; the police did not believe his story, **however**.* (but not *~~… the police did not believe, however, his story.~~*)

Adverbials expressing **contrast** often have commas **after** them.

- *They were becoming increasingly discouraged. **However,** they continued walking.*
- *Income is satisfactory; **on the other hand,** expenditure has increased alarmingly.*

*Yet* is not usually followed by a comma.

- *It was cold, **yet** it was pleasant.* (not *~~… yet, it was pleasant.~~*)

## One-clause sentences

Sometimes a single clause with a conjunction is written as a separate sentence. Some people feel this is incorrect, but it is normal in question-and-answer sequences, or when a writer wishes to give extra emphasis to a clause.

- *Why are we in financial trouble? **Because** the banks lent money to the wrong people.*
- *He was charming. **But** he was totally without a conscience.*
