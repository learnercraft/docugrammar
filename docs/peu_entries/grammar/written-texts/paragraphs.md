# Paragraphs

Written English text is usually divided into blocks called ‘paragraphs’, to make it easier to read. Paragraphs can vary in length, from several hundred words (for example in literary or academic writing), to a few sentences (for example in journalism or letters). A paragraph division is usually shown by starting the text on a new line and ‘indenting’ (leaving a space at the beginning of the line). The paragraph divisions break the material up into easily ‘digestible’ sections, providing places where the reader can pause and think for a moment if necessary. And good writers can show the structure of their texts by making paragraph divisions in suitable places, for example when they move to a new stage in a story, a new point in a discussion or a new part of a description.

was: should he commit suicide now or wait until after
payday and get drunk first?*

don't have to travel to your job, you can choose your
own working hours, you can take a day off if you want
to, you don't wast time in endless unnecessary
meetings, and - perhaps most important of all - you
don't have a boss constantly checking up on you.*  
> (a new point in the discussion ->) *On the other hand, it can be lonely working by
yourself. Without colleagues around you ...*

Another practice, common in typed letters and documents, is to leave a blank line without indenting.
