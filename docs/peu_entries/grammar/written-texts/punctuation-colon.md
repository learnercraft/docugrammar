# Punctuation: colon

## Explanations

A colon (:) usually introduces an explanation or further details.

- *We decided not to go to Mexico: we had too little money.*
- *There was a problem with the car: it was losing oil.*

## Lists

A colon can introduce a list.

- *The main points are as follows: (1) … , (2) … , (3) … .*
- *We need three kinds of support: economic, moral and political.*

## Subdivisions

A colon can introduce a subdivision of a subject in a title or heading.

- ***``PUNCTUATION: COLON``***

## Capitals

In British English, it is unusual for a capital letter to follow a colon (except at the beginning of a quotation). However, this can happen if a colon is followed by several complete sentences.

- *My main objections are as follows:*
  - *First of all, no complete budget has been drawn up.*
  - *Secondly, there is no guarantee that …*

In American English, colons are more often followed by capital letters.

## Letters

Americans usually put a colon after the opening salutation (*Dear …*) in a business letter.

- *Dear Mr. Callan:*  
  *I am writing to …*

British usage prefers a comma or no punctuation mark at all in this case.

## Direct speech

Normally, direct speech is introduced by a comma in writing.

- ***Stewart opened his eyes and said**, ‘Who’s your beautiful friend?’*

But a long passage of direct speech may be introduced by a colon.

- *Introducing his report for the year, **the Chairman said:** ‘A number of factors have contributed to the company’s very gratifying results. First of all, …’*

And a colon is used when direct speech is introduced by a name or short phrase (as in the text of a play, or when famous sayings are quoted).

- ``Polonius:`` *What do you read, my lord?*  
  ``Hamlet:`` *Words, words, words.*

- ***In the words of Murphy’s Law:** ‘Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.’*
