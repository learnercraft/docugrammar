# Punctuation: comma

## The basic sentence

We do not use commas to separate the basic parts of a sentence (subject and verb, verb and object).

- *The standard of living of the dock workers was slowly improving.* (not *~~The standard of living of the dock workers, was slowly improving.~~*)
- *Many of them were able to begin buying their own homes.* (not *~~Many of them were able to begin buying, their own homes.~~*)

## Before and after the basic sentence

If we put long adverbial expressions **before** the basic sentence, we often use a comma. Compare:

- ***At that time** the standard of living of the dock workers was slowly improving.*
- ***During the late 1920s and early 1930s**, the standard of living of the dock workers was slowly improving.*

We do not so often put commas when adverbial expressions come **after** the basic sentence.

- *The standard of living of the dock workers was slowly **improving during the late 1920s and early 1930s**.*

## Inside the basic sentence

When adverbial expressions come between or inside parts of the basic sentence, we may put commas **before** and **after** them.

- *The standard of living of the dock workers<strong>, during the late 1920s and early 1930s,</strong> was steadily improving.*

## Noun phrases

We do not usually separate a noun from the adjectives or other expressions that go with it.

- *the mainly foreign labourers* (not *~~the mainly foreign, labourers~~*)
- *the mainly foreign labourers in the north-eastern docks* (not *~~the mainly foreign labourers, in the north-eastern docks~~*)

However, we do use commas to separate **non-identifying expressions** [(see here)](./../relative-clauses/identifying-and-non-identifying-clauses-the-tall-man-who-mr-rogers-who).

- *Andreas Bergmeister, **who established the dock workers’ union**, …*

## Sentences with conjunctions

We often put commas in sentences with conjunctions, especially in longer sentences. Compare:

- *The situation changed **when** the export markets began to contract.*
- *The situation changed noticeably for the worse after 1932, **when** the export markets began to contract.*

We usually use a comma if we start with the conjunction.

- ***When** the export markets began to contract, the situation changed.*

## Indirect speech

We do not put commas after verbs of saying, thinking, etc in indirect speech.

- *Many commentators declared that the economy was in serious trouble.* (not *~~Many commentators declared, that the economy …~~*)
- *No one knew how serious the situation would become.* (not *~~No one knew, how serious …~~*)

A useful rule: we do not put a comma before *that* (conjunction or relative pronoun).

- *They did not understand **that** the economic conditions **that** had existed earlier had disappeared for good.*

## Between grammatically separate sentences

Between grammatically separate sentences (with no conjunction), we use a full stop or a semi-colon, but not a comma. Compare:

- *Orders began to dry up, and most companies reduced their work force.* (comma and conjunction)
- *Orders began to dry up. Most companies started to reduce their work force.* ``or`` *Orders began to dry up; most companies started to reduce their work force.* (but not *~~Orders began to dry up, most companies started …~~*)

## Conjunctions and adverbs

Note that some linking words (e.g. *consequently*, *however*, *therefore*) are adverbs, not conjunctions. A sentence beginning with an adverb is grammatically separate from the sentence before it; consequently, a full stop or semi-colon is necessary between the sentences [(see here)](./linking-with-conjunctions-and-adverbials).

- *Orders began to dry up. Consequently, most companies started to reduce their work force.* (not *~~Orders began to dry up, consequently, most companies …~~*)
- *Orders began to dry up; however, some companies tried to carry on as before.* (not *~~Orders began to dry up, however, some companies …~~*)

## Commas between adjectives

Before a noun, we use commas mostly to separate adjectives that give the same or related kinds of information.

- *a **tall, impressive** figure*
- *a **long, boring** speech*
- ***an expensive, ill-planned, wasteful** project*

Commas are sometimes dropped between short adjectives.

- *a **tall(,) dark(,) handsome** cowboy*

Commas are not dropped when adjectives or other modifiers refer to different parts of something.

- *a **green, red** and gold carpet* (not *~~a green red and gold carpet~~*)
- ***concrete, glass** and plastic buildings*

Before a noun, commas are not normally used when adjectives give different kinds of information.

- *Have you met our **handsome new financial** director?* (not *~~… our handsome, new, financial director~~*)
- ***surprising new** developments*
- ***gloomy economic** forecasts*

After *be* and other linking verbs, adjectives are punctuated like a list (see below).

- *His speech was **long, boring, detailed and irrelevant**.*
- *The cowboy was **tall, dark and handsome**.*

## Lists

We use commas to separate the different things in a list (but not usually before *and* unless the last item is long). Compare:

- *The developing crisis affected manufacturers``,`` distributors``,`` marketing organisations``,`` banks **and** credit agencies.*
- *… marketing organisations``,`` banks``,`` **and** some of the major credit agencies.*

## Numbers

Commas are used to divide large numbers into groups of three figures, by separating off the thousands and millions.

- *6,435* (not *~~6.435~~*)
- *7,456,189*

We do not always use commas in four-figure numbers, and they are never used in dates.

- *3,164 or 3164*
- *the year 1946*

Spaces are sometimes used instead of commas.

- *There are 1 000 millimetres in 1 metre.*

We do not use commas in decimals [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/vocabulary-areas/numbers#fractions-and-decimals-two-fifths-nought-point-four).

- *3.5 = three point five* ``or`` *three and a half* (not *~~three comma five~~*)
