# Punctuation: dash

Dashes (–) are especially common in informal writing. They can be used in the same way as colons, semi-colons or brackets.

- *There are three things I can never remember – names, faces, and I’ve forgotten the other.*
- *We had a great time in Greece – the kids really loved it.*
- *My mother – who rarely gets angry – really lost her temper.*

A dash can introduce an afterthought, or something unexpected and surprising.

- *We’ll be arriving on Monday morning – at least, I think so.*
- *And then we met Joseph – with Lisa, believe it or not!*

:::note

For the use of hyphens (as in *hard-working* or *co-operative*), [(see here)](./../../vocabulary/word-formation-and-spelling/hyphens).
