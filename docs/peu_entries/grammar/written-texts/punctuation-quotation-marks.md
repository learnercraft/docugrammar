# Punctuation: quotation marks

Quotation marks can be single (‘…’) or double (‘‘…’’). They are also called ‘inverted commas’ in British English.

## Direct speech

We use quotation marks (single or double) when we quote direct speech. For quotations inside quotations, we use double quotation marks inside single (or single inside double).

- *‘His last words,’ said Albert, ‘were “Close that bloody window”.’*

American usage often prefers single quotation marks inside double in these cases.

## Special use of words

We often put quotation marks (usually single) round words which are used in special ways – for example when we talk about them or when we give them special meanings.

- *People disagree about how to use the word ‘disinterested’.*
- *A textbook can be a ‘wall’ between the teacher and the class.*

American usage often prefers double quotation marks in these cases.
