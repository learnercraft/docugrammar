# Punctuation: semi-colon

## Instead of full stops

Semi-colons (;) are sometimes used instead of full stops, in cases where sentences are grammatically independent but the meaning is closely connected. Semi-colons are not nearly as common as full stops or commas.

- *Some people work best in the mornings; others do better in the evenings.*
- *It is a fine idea; let us hope that it is going to work.*

Commas are not usually possible in cases like these [(see here)](./punctuation-comma#between-grammatically-separate-sentences).

## In lists

Semi-colons can also be used to separate items in a list, particularly when these are grammatically complex.

- *You may use the sports facilities on condition that your subscription is paid regularly; that you arrange for all necessary cleaning to be carried out; that you undertake to make good any damage; â€¦*

:::note

For commas in lists, [(see here)](./punctuation-comma).
