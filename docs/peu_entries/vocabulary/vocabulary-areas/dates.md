# Dates

## Writing

In Britain, the commonest way to write the day’s date is as follows. Note that the names of months always begin with capital letters [(see here)](./../word-formation-and-spelling/capital-letters).

- *30 March 2004*
- *27 July 2003*

The last two letters of the number word are sometimes added (e.g. *1st*, *2nd*, *3rd*, *6th*). Some people write a comma before the year, but this is no longer very common in Britain except when the date comes inside a sentence.

- *30th March(,) 2004*
- *He was born in Hawick on 14 December, 1942.*

The date may be written entirely in figures.

- *30/3/04*
- *30-3-04*
- *30.3.04*

In the USA it is common to write the month first and to put a comma before the year.

- *March 30, 2004*

All-figure dates are written differently in Britain and America, since British people put the day first while Americans generally start with the month. So for example, *6.4.02* means ‘6 April 2002’ in Britain, but ‘June 4, 2002’ in the USA.

The longer names of the months are often abbreviated as follows:

- *Jan*
- *Feb*
- *Mar*
- *Apr*
- *Aug*
- *Sept*
- *Oct*
- *Nov*
- *Dec*

The names of decades (e.g. *the nineteen sixties*) can be written like this: *the 1960s* (less commonly *1960’s*).

## Speaking

30 March 1993 = ‘March the thirtieth, nineteen ninety-three’ (AmE also *‘March thirtieth …’*) ``or`` ‘the thirtieth of March, nineteen ninety-three’

1200 = *twelve hundred*

1305 = *thirteen hundred and five* ``or`` *thirteen oh*(/əʊ/) *five*

1498 = *fourteen (hundred and) ninety-eight*

1910 = *nineteen (hundred and) ten*

1946 = *nineteen (hundred and) forty-six*

2000 = *two thousand*

2005 = *two thousand and five* ``or`` *twenty oh five*

To announce the date, *It’s* is used.

- ***It’s** April (the) first.*

To ask about dates, we can say for instance:

- *What’s the date (today)?*
- *What date is it?*
- *What date is the meeting?* (or *When is the meeting?*)

## BC and AD

To distinguish between dates before and after the birth of Christ, we use the abbreviations *BC* (= Before Christ) and *AD* (= Anno Domini – Latin for ‘in the year of the Lord’). *BC* follows the date; *AD* can come before or after it.

- *Julius Caesar first came to Britain in **55 BC**.*
- *The emperor Trajan was born in **AD 53** / **53 AD**.*

However, instead of *BC* and *AD*, many people now prefer to use *BCE* (‘before the Common Era’) and *CE* (‘Common Era’).
