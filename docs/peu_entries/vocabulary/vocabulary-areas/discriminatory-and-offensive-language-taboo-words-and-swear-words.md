# Discriminatory and offensive language, taboo words and swear words

The words and expressions described in this entry are generally offensive: their use can upset or insult people. They are included here because they are elements of English, and it is not the job of a usage guide to conceal aspects of the language. However, students should realise that if they use language of this kind, they are liable to offend and upset the people they are talking to. They are also likely to give their listeners or readers the impression that they are insensitive, prejudiced, intolerant, uneducated or worse.

## False generics

One kind of discriminatory language involves ‘false generics’ – words that suggest that all people in a certain category, are, for example, exclusively male or female. Talking in general about ‘firemen’, for instance, implies that all firefighters are men, which is clearly not the case. Some examples:

| false generics | inclusive language |
| --- | --- |
| *ambulance men* | *ambulance staff, paramedics* |
| *chairman* | *chair, chairperson* |
| *cleaning lady* | *cleaner* |
| *fireman* | *firefighter* |
| *foreman* | *supervisor* |
| *mailman* (AmE) | *mail carrier* (AmE) |
| *male/female* (on a form) | *male / female / prefer not to say* |
| *man-hours* | *staff hours* |
| *man-made* | *synthetic, manufactured* |
| *man, mankind* | *humanity, the human race* |
| *manning* | *staffing* |
| *manpower* | *human resources, employees* |
| *policeman/men* | *police officer(s)* |
| *postman/men* (BrE) | *postal worker(s)* (BrE) |
| *steward/stewardess* | *flight attendant* |
| *waiters/waitresses* | *restaurant staff, servers* |

False generics are falling out of use in English, even to speak about individuals – so an individual fireman might well be described in a news report as a ‘firefighter’.

 A similar way of discriminating is to use a word or expression that is acceptable in one context, but that makes a person or an experience sound less serious or important. For example, a man’s calling women he works with ‘the girls in the office’ is different from calling female children ‘girls’. Talking about a ’salesgirl’ instead of a *shop assistant* (BrE) or *salesperson* (AmE) is thus discriminatory in two ways at once.

## Offensive language

Other words and expressions are used to discriminate against particular groups – to present them as inferior or undesirable in one way or another. Common targets of discriminatory language are disability status, gender, sexual orientation, nationality and ethnicity. In some cases the offensive use of a term may be accidental – a speaker may not realise, for example, that disabled people prefer not to be called ‘handicapped’. (Preferred words and expressions can change over time; to find out what term a group itself prefers, check on the internet.) At the other extreme, words like *dyke* or *nigger* are clearly only normally used to be deliberately offensive. Some examples:

| offensive term | preferred alternative |
| --- | --- |
| *cripple, handicapped person* | *disabled person, person with a disability* |
| *mental handicap* | *mental/learning disability* |
| *retarded, mentally handicapped* | *having learning difficulties / a mental/learning disability* |
| *disturbed, mad, crazy, nuts* | *having a mental illness / health problem / health condition* |
| *homo, queer* | *gay* |
| *dyke, lezzie, lezzo* | *lesbian, gay woman* |
| *fag, faggot* (AmE) | *gay man* |
| *sex change* | *gender reassignment* |
| *transsexual, trannie* | *transgender person, trans person* |
| *Chink* | *Chinese person* |
| *dago* | *Spanish, Italian Portuguese person* |
| *Frog* | *Frenchman/woman* |
| *gyppo, pikey* | *Roma, traveller* (or Gypsy) |
| *Jap* | *Japanese* |
| *Kraut* | *German* |
| *nigger* | *black person* (BrE), African-American (AmE) |
| *Paki* | *Pakistani* |
| *Polack* (AmE) | *Pole* |
| *spic* (AmE) | *Latin-American* |
| *wog* | *Middle-Eastern person* |
| *wop* | *Italian* |
| *yid* (AmE), kike (AmE) | *Jew* |

When a neutral term is widely used to discriminate, it may come to be felt as offensive, leading to its rejection. This has happened with *Negro* (replaced by *black* or *African-American*), *Eskimo* (replaced by *Inuit*), *handicapped* (replaced by *disabled*) and *Mongol*/*Mongoloid*/*Mongolism* (replaced by *(having) Down’s syndrome*). Some Roma people now also regard *Gypsy* as offensive.

 Note that it may sometimes be acceptable for members of a group to call one another, for example, ‘dyke’ or ‘nigger’. But of course it is not at all acceptable for people outside the group to use the word.

## Taboo words

Many languages have words which are considered dangerous, holy, magic or shocking, and which are only used in certain situations or by certain people. For instance, in some African tribes the names of dead chiefs must not be said; in many cultures, words associated with religious beliefs are used only on religious occasions, or only by priests. Words of this kind can be called ‘taboo words’.

English has three main groups of taboo words and expressions:

1. A number of words connected with the Christian religion (e.g. the names *Christ*, *God*) are considered holy by some people. These people prefer to use such words only in formal and respectful contexts, and they may be upset or shocked by their ‘careless’ use.
2. Certain words relating to sexual activity and the associated parts of the body (e.g. *fuck*, *balls*) are regarded as shocking by many people. Half a century or so ago some of these words could not be printed or broadcast, and they are still comparatively unusual in public speech and writing. In polite or formal language these words are generally avoided, or replaced by other words and expressions (e.g. *make love* or *have sexual intercourse*, *testicles*).
3. Some words referring to the elimination of bodily wastes (what one does in the toilet), and the associated parts of the body, are also regarded as ‘dirty’ or shocking (e.g. *piss*, *shit*). They are often replaced by more ‘polite’ words and expressions with the same meaning (e.g. *urinate*, *defecate*) or by substitutes (e.g. *go to the toilet*, *go to the bathroom* (especially AmE), *wash one’s hands*).

Linguistic taboos in English-speaking countries are much less strong than they used to be. Most taboo words shock less than they did, say, twenty years ago. And increasingly, people are using informal taboo words which are felt to be amusingly ‘naughty’ rather than shocking, such as *shag*, *screw* or *bonk* instead of *fuck*, or *willy* instead of *prick* (= ‘penis’).

Nonetheless, students should be very careful about using taboo words. There are two reasons for this. First of all, it is not easy to know the exact strength of these expressions in a foreign language, or to know what kind of people are shocked by them, and in what circumstances. One may easily say something that is meant as a joke, but which seriously upsets the people one is talking to. And secondly, using this sort of language generally indicates membership of a group: one most often uses it in the company of people one knows well, who belong to one’s own social circle, age group, etc. (Children usually avoid using taboo language in front of adults so as not to annoy or shock them, and adults act similarly in front of children for similar reasons.) So a foreigner who uses swear words may give the impression of claiming membership of a group that he or she does not belong to.

## Examples of taboo words

The following are some of the most common English taboo words, with explanations of their literal meanings where necessary. Their approximate ‘strength’ is shown by stars: one-star words like *hell*, *damn* or *blast* (which are scarcely taboo in modern English) will not upset many people, while a three-star word may be very shocking if it is used in the wrong situation. Note, however, that individual reactions to particular words (and to swearing in general) vary enormously, and that attitudes are changing rapidly (and generally becoming more tolerant of this kind of language). So people of different ages and backgrounds are likely to disagree a good deal about the strength of the words listed.

The words associated with religion are not considered shocking when used with their literal meaning, and the stars show their strength when used as swear words. The strength of the other words is mostly the same whether they are used literally or for swearing.

### Religion

| taboo word | meaning |
|------------|---------|
| damn       | condemn to hell (rare in literal sense; mainly used as swear word) |
| blast (BrE) | strike with divine punishment (rare in literal sense; mainly used as swear word) |
| hell       |         |
| God        |         |
| Jesus *    |         |
| Christ *   |         |

(*Damn*, *blast* and *hell* have lost most of their strength, and are scarcely regarded as swear words by most people in modern English. *Hell* and *blast* are no longer very common.)

### Parts of the body

| taboo word       | meaning                 |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| arse ** (AmE ass **) | bottom, buttocks, anus |
| arsehole ** (AmE asshole *) | anus              |
| balls **         | testicles               |
| bollocks ** (BrE) | testicles               |
| cock **          | penis                   |
| dick **          | penis                   |
| prick **         | penis                   |
| tits **          | breasts                 |
| cunt ***         | woman’s sex organs      |
| twat **          | woman’s sex organs (rare) |

|---------------|-----------------------------|
| fuck **       | have sex (with)             |
| wank ** (AmE jerk off **) | masturbate (have sex with oneself) |
| bugger ** (BrE) | have anal intercourse with a person or animal; person who does so (rare in literal sense) |
| come *        | reach a sexual climax (orgasm) |
| sod * (BrE)   | homosexual (abbreviation of sodomite; rare in literal sense) |
| bitch *       | female dog; earlier used for ‘immoral’ woman |
| whore **      | prostitute                  |
| bastard *     | child of unmarried parents  |

### Toilet

| taboo word    | meaning                     |
|---------------|-----------------------------|
| piss **       | urine; urinate              |
| shit **       | excrement; defecate         |
| crap *        | excrement; defecate         |
| fart *        | (let out) digestive gas out from the anus |

## Swear words

Because taboo words are shocking, they are common in situations where people wish to express powerful emotions by using ‘strong’ language. This is called ‘swearing’. When people swear, taboo words usually change their meaning completely. For example, *fuck off* and *piss off* have nothing to do with sex or urinating; they are simply violently rude ways of saying ‘go away’. The strength of the original taboo word is borrowed for a different purpose. Compare:

- *What are you doing **fucking** in my bed?* (= Why are you making love in my bed? – literal meaning of *fucking*)
- *What are you **fucking** doing in my bed?* (= Why on earth are you in my bed? – *fucking* used as a swear word)

The meaning of a swear word can also change with its grammatical form. For instance, *piss off* is an aggressive way of saying *go away*; ***pissed*** is British slang for *drunk* (and American for *angry*); *pissed off* is British slang for *fed up*. Many swear words are grammatically very flexible. *Fucking*, for example, can act both as an adjective (e.g. ****fucking**** *idiot*) and as an intensifying adverb (e.g. ****fucking**** *good*, ****fucking**** *soon,* *it’s* ****fucking**** *raining*, ****fucking**** *well shut up*). It is even sometimes put into the middle of another word (*abso****\-fucking****\-lutely*). Swear words are the only words in the language that have this grammatical range.

The following list shows some of the most common expressions used in swearing; they are grouped according to meaning.
