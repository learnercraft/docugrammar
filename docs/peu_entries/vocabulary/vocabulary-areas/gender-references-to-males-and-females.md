# Gender (references to males and females)

English does not have many problems of grammatical gender. Usually, people are *he* or *she* and things are *it*. Note the following points.

## Animals, cars, ships and countries

People sometimes call animals *he* or *she*, especially when they are thought of as having personality, intelligence or feelings. This is common with pets and domestic animals like cats, dogs and horses.

- *Once upon a time there was a rabbit called Joe. **He** lived …*
- *Go and find the cat and put **her** out.*

In these cases, *who* is often used instead of *which*.

- *She had an old dog **who** always slept in her bed.*

Some people use *she* for cars, motorbikes, etc; sailors often use *she* for boats and ships (but most other people use *it*).

- *‘How’s your new car?’ ‘Terrific. **She**’s running beautifully.’*
- *The ship’s struck a rock. **She**’s sinking!*

We can use *she* for countries, but *it* is more common in modern English.

- *Norway has decided to increase **its** trade with Romania.(or … **her** trade …)*

## *he or she*

Traditionally, English used *he/him/his* when the sex of a person was not known, or in references that could apply to either men or women, especially in a formal style.

- *If I ever find the person who did that, I’ll kill **him**.*
- *If a student is ill, **he** must send **his** medical certificate to the College office.*

This usage is now widely regarded as sexist, and is generally avoided. *He or she*, *him or her* and *his or her* (also *he/she*, *him/her*, *his/her*) are common alternatives, especially in a formal style.

- *If a student is ill, **he or she** must send a medical certificate …*

## Singular *they*

*They* is often used to mean ‘he or she’, especially after indefinite words like *somebody*, *anybody*, *nobody*, *person*. This usage is sometimes considered ‘incorrect’, but it has been common in educated speech for centuries. For details, [(see here)](./../../grammar/pronouns/singular-they).

- *If anybody wants my ticket, **they** can have it.*
- *‘There’s somebody at the door.’ ‘Tell **them** I’m out.’*
- *When a person gets married, **they** have to start thinking about **their** responsibilities.*

## *actor* and *actress*, etc

A few jobs and positions have different words for men and women. Examples:

| Man | Woman |
| --- | --- |
| *actor* | *actress* |
| *(bride)groom* | *bride* |
| *duke* | *duchess* |
| *hero* | *heroine* |
| *host* | *hostess* |
| *manager* | *manageress* |
| *monk* | *nun* |
| *policeman* | *policewoman* |
| *prince* | *princess* |
| *steward* | *stewardess* |
| *waiter* | *waitress* |
| *widower* | *widow* |

A *mayor* can be a man or a woman; in Britain a *mayoress* is the wife of a male mayor.

The use of separate terms for women’s roles is often felt to be discriminatory or sexist, and some of the words listed above are going out of use. *Actor*, *hero* and *manager* are now commonly used for women as well as men. *Police officer* is replacing *policeman/policewoman*, and *flight attendant* is replacing *steward/stewardess*.

## Words ending in *-man*

Some words ending in *\-man* do not have a common feminine equivalent (e.g. *chairman*, *fireman*, *spokesman*). As many people consider it inappropriate to call a woman, for example, ‘chairman’ or ‘spokesman’, these words are now often avoided in references to women or in general references to people of either sex. In many cases, *\-person* is now used instead of *\-man*.

- *Alice has just been elected **chairperson** (``or`` **chair**) of our committee.*
- *A **spokesperson** said that the Minister does not intend to resign.*

In some cases, new words ending in *\-woman* (e.g. *spokeswoman*) are coming into use. But it is now common practice to choose words, even for men, which are not gender-marked (e.g. *supervisor* instead of *foreman*, *ambulance staff* instead of *ambulance men*, *firefighter* instead of *fireman*).

## *man*

*Man* and *mankind* have traditionally been used for the human race.

- *Why does **man** have more diseases than animals?*
- *That’s one small step for a man, one giant leap for **mankind**.* (Neil Armstrong, on stepping onto the moon)

This is now generally considered sexist, and preferred terms are *people*, *humanity* or *the human race*. Note also the common use of *synthetic* instead of *man-made*.
