# Nationalities, countries and regions

## Introduction

In order to refer to a nation or region and its affairs it is usually necessary to know four words:

- the name of the country or region
  - *Denmark*
  - *Japan*
  - *France*
  - *Catalonia*
- the adjective
  - *Danish*
  - *Japanese*
  - *French*
  - *Catalan*
- the singular noun used for a person from the country
  - *a Dane*
  - *a Japanese*
  - *a Frenchman/woman*
  - *a Catalan*
- the plural expression *the …* used for the population as a whole
  - *the Danes*
  - *the Japanese*
  - *the French*
  - *the Catalans*

Usually the singular noun is the same as the adjective (e.g. *Greek*, *Mexican*). The plural expression is usually the same as the adjective + *\-s* (e.g. *the Greeks*, *the Mexicans*); words ending in *\-ese*, and *Swiss*, remain unchanged for plural meanings (e.g. *the Japanese*; *the Swiss*). [(see here)](./nationalities-countries-and-regions#examples) below for more examples. However, there are a number of exceptions. Some of these are listed in [(see here)](./nationalities-countries-and-regions#exceptions).

 All words of this kind (including adjectives) begin with capital letters.

- ***American** literature* (not *~~american literature~~*)

The name of a national language is often the same as the national adjective.

- ***Danish** is difficult to pronounce.*
- *Do you speak **Japanese**?*

**Notes**

1. *Scottish* is the usual word for the people and culture of Scotland; *Scotch* is used for whisky.
2. The word *Briton* is unusual except in newspaper headlines – for example *TWO BRITONS KILLED IN AIR CRASH*. *Brit* is sometimes used informally.
3. *English* is not the same as *British*, and is not used for Scottish, Welsh or Irish people [(see here)](./../word-problems-from-a-to-z/britain-the-united-kingdom-the-british-isles-and-england).
4. *English* (the name of the language) can be used in the plural to talk about varieties of English, for instance *World Englishes*.
5. Although *American* is the normal English word for United States citizens and affairs, people from other parts of the American continent may object to this use, and some people avoid it for this reason.
6. *Inuit* is now considered a more respectful term than *Eskimo* for the Arctic races of Northern Canada and elsewhere.
7. *Arabic* is used for the language spoken in Arab countries; in other cases, the normal adjective is *Arab*. *Arabian* is used in a few fixed expressions and place names (e.g. *Saudi Arabian*, *the Arabian Sea*).
8. Note the pronunciation of words like *Irishman/men*, *Dutchman/men*: the singular is the same as the plural (/ˈaɪrɪʃmən, ˈdʌtʃmən/).
