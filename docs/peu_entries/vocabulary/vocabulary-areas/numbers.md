# Numbers

## Fractions and decimals: *two fifths*; *nought point four*

We say simple fractions like this:

| Fraction | Read/Write as |
| --- | --- |
| ¼ | *a/one quarter* |
| ⅛ | *an/one eighth* |
| ³⁄₇ | *three sevenths* |
| ⅖ | *two fifths* |
| ¹¹⁄₁₆ | *eleven sixteenths* |
| 3¾ | *three and three quarters* |
| 6⅛ | *six and one eighth* |

More complex fractions can be expressed by using the word *over*.

- ³¹⁷⁄₅₀₉: *three hundred and seventeen **over** five hundred and nine*

We write and say decimals like this:

| Decimal | Read/Write as |
| --- | --- |
| 0.4 | *nought/zero **point** four* (not *~~0,4~~*) or *~~nought comma four~~* |
| 0.375 | *nought/zero point **three seven five*** (not *~~nought point three hundred and seventy-five~~*) |
| 4.7 | *four point seven* |

For the difference between *a(n)* and *one* with numbers, [(see here)](./numbers#a-and-one) below.

## Before nouns

With fractions below 1, we use *of* before nouns.

- *three quarters **of** an hour*
- *seven tenths **of** a mile*
- *a third **of** the students*

*Half* is not always followed by *of* [(see here)](./../word-problems-from-a-to-z/half).

- ***half** an hour* (AmE also *a half hour*)
- ***half* (of)* the students*

*Of* is also possible with decimals below 1.

- *nought point six **of** a mile*
- *0.1625cm: nought point one six two five **of** a centimetre*

However, decimals below *1* are often followed directly by plural nouns.

- *nought point six **miles*** (not *~~nought point six mile~~*)
- *nought point one six two five **centimetres***

Fractions and decimals over *1* are normally followed by plural nouns.

- *one and a half **hours*** (not *~~one and a half hour~~*)
- *three and three eighths **miles***
- *1.3 **millimetres*** (not *~~1.3 millimetre~~*)

Note also the structure *a … and a half*.

- *I’ve been waiting for **an hour and a half**.*

## Singular or plural verbs

Singular verbs are normally used after fractions, decimals, and other expressions referring to amounts and measurements (for more details, [(see here)](./../../grammar/nouns-and-noun-phrases-agreement/plural-expressions-with-singular-verbs).

- *Three quarters of a ton **is** too much.* (not *~~Three quarters of a ton are …~~*)
- *3.6 kilometres **is** about 2 miles.*

But plural verbs are used when we are talking about numbers of people or things, even after a singular fraction.

- *A third of the students **are** from abroad.* (not *~~A third of the students is …~~*)
- *Half of the glasses **are** broken.*

After expressions like *one in three*, *one out of five* + plural noun, both singular and plural verbs are possible.

- *One in three new cars **break**/**breaks** down in the first year.*

## Telephone numbers

We say each figure separately, pausing after groups of three or four (not two). 0 is often called *oh* (like the letter *O*).

- *307 4922*: *three oh/zero seven, four nine two two*

## Roman numerals

Roman numerals (*I*, *II*, *III*, *IV*, etc) are not common in modern English, but they are still used in a few cases – for example the names of kings and queens, page numbers in the introductions to some books, the numbers of paragraphs in some documents, the numbers of questions in some examinations, the figures on some old clock faces, and occasionally the names of centuries.

- *It was built in the time of Henry **V**.*
- *For details, see Introduction page **ix**.*
- *Do question **(vi)** or question **(vii)**, but not both.*
- *a fine **XVIII** Century English walnut chest of drawers*

The Roman numerals normally used are as follows:
| Arabic numeral | Roman numeral | Arabic numeral | Roman numeral | Arabic numeral | Roman numeral |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | *I i* | 10 | *X x* | 40 | *XL xl* |
| 2 | *II ii* | 11 | *XI xi* | 45 | *XLV xlv* |
| 3 | *III iii* | 12 | *XII xii* | 50 | *L l* |
| 4 | *IV iv* | 13 | *XIII xiii* | 60 | *LX lx* |
| 5 | *V v* | 14 | *XIV xiv* | 90 | *XC xc* |
| 6 | *VI vi* | 19 | *XIX xix* | 100 | *C c* |
| 7 | *VII vii* | 20 | *XX xx* | 500 | *D* |
| 8 | *VIII viii* | 21 | *XXI xxi* | 1000 | *M* |
| 9 | *IX ix* | 30 | *XXX xxx* | 1995 | *MCMXCV* |

## Cardinal and ordinal numbers: books, chapters, etc; kings and queens

**After** a noun we usually use a cardinal number (*one*, *two*, etc) instead of an ordinal number (*first*, *second*, etc). This structure is common in titles. Compare:

- *the fourth book – Book **Four***
- *the third act – Act **Three***
- *Mozart’s thirty-ninth symphony – Symphony No. **39**, by Mozart*
- *the third day of the course – Timetable for Day **Three***

However, the names of kings and queens are said with ordinal numbers.

- *Henry VIII: Henry the **Eighth*** (not *~~Henry Eight~~*)
- *Louis XIV: Louis the **Fourteenth***
- *Elizabeth II: Elizabeth the **Second***

## Centuries

Note how the names of centuries relate to the years in them. The period from 1701 – 1800 is called the **18**th century (not the 17th); 1801 – 1900 is the **19**th century, etc.

## Floors

The **ground floor** of a British house is the **first floor** of an American house; the British **first floor** is the American **second floor**, etc.

## *and*: punctuation

In British English we always put *and* between *hundred/thousand/million* and numbers below a hundred. In American English, *and* can be dropped.

| Number | Read as |
| --- | --- |
| 310 | *three hundred **and** ten* (AmE also three hundred ten) |
| 5,642 | *five thousand, six hundred **and** forty-two* |
| 2,025 | *two thousand **and** twenty-five* |

In measurements containing two different units, *and* is possible before the smaller, but is usually left out.

- *two hours **(and)** ten minutes*
- *two metres **(and)** thirty centimetres*

In writing we generally use commas (,) to divide large numbers into groups of three figures, by separating off the thousands and the millions. Full stops (.) are not used in this way.

- *3,127* (not *~~3.127~~*)
- *5,466,243*

We do not always use commas in four-figure numbers, and they are not used in dates.

- *4,126 or 4126*
- *the year 1648*

Spaces are also possible.

- *There are 1 000 millimetres in a metre.*

Note the hyphen between the tens and units in *twenty-one*, *twenty-two*, *thirty-six*, *forty-nine*, etc.

## *a* and *one*

We can say *an eighth* or *one eighth*, *a hundred* or *one hundred*, *a thousand* or *one thousand*, *a million* or *one million*, etc. *One* is more formal.

- *I want to live for **a** hundred years.* (not *~~… for hundred years~~*)
- *He was fined **one** thousand pounds for dangerous driving.*

*A* can only be used at the beginning of a number. Compare:

- ***a**/**one** hundred*
- *three thousand **one** hundred* (not *~~three thousand a hundred~~*)

*A thousand* can be used alone, and before *and*, but not usually before a number of hundreds. Compare:

- ***a**/**one** thousand*
- ***a**/**one** thousand and forty-nine*
- ***one** thousand, six hundred and two* (More natural than *a thousand, six hundred and two.*)

We can use *a* or *one* with measurement words. The rules are similar.

- ***a**/**one** kilometre* (``BUT`` **one* kilometre, six hundred metres*)
- ***an**/**one** hour and seventeen minutes* (``BUT`` **one* hour, seventeen minutes*)
- ***a**/**one** pound* (``BUT`` **one* pound twenty-five*)

## Numbers with determiners

Numbers can be used after determiners. Before determiners, a structure with *of* is necessary.

- *You’re **my one** hope.*
- ***One of my** friends gave me this.* (not *~~One my friend …~~*)

## *eleven hundred*, etc

In an informal style we often use *eleven hundred*, *twelve hundred*, etc instead of *one thousand one hundred*, etc. This is most common with round numbers between 1,100 and 1,900.

- *We only got **fifteen hundred** pounds for the car.*

This form is used in historical dates before 2000 [(see here)](./dates).

- *He was born in **thirteen hundred**.*
- *It was built in **fifteen** (**hundred** and) twenty-nine.*

## *billion*

A *billion* is a thousand million. (But in older British usage a *billion* was a million million.)

## *five hundred*, etc without *-s*

After a number, the words *dozen*, *hundred*, *thousand*, *million* and *billion* have no final *\-s*, and *of* is not used. This also happens after *several* and *a few*. Compare:

- ***five hundred** pounds*  
  ***hundreds of** pounds*
- ***several thousand** times*  
  *It cost **thousands**.*
- *a **few million** years*  
  ***millions of** years*

Singular forms are used as modifiers before nouns in plural measuring expressions.

- *a **five-pound** note* (not *~~a five-pounds note~~*)
- *a **three-mile** walk*
- *six **two-hour** lessons*
- *a **three-month**\-old baby*
- *a **four-foot** deep hole*
- *a **six-foot** tall man*

In an informal style, we often use *foot* instead of *feet* in other structures, especially when we talk about people’s heights.

- *My father’s just over six **foot** two.*

:::note

For the use of *be* in measurements, [(see here)](./../../grammar/be-have-and-do/be-and-have#age-height-weight-size-and-colour).

For the use of possessive forms in expressions of time (e.g. *ten minutes’ walk*; *four days’ journey*), [(see here)](./../../grammar/nouns-and-noun-phrases-agreement/nouns-in-combination-my-father-s-house#measurement-of-time-a-day-s-journey).

## British money

There are 100 *pence* in a *pound*. Sums of money are named as follows:

- *1p*
- *5p*
- *£3.75*
- *one penny* (informal *one p* (/piː/) (or a penny))
- *five pence* (informal *five p*)
- *three pounds seventy-five (pence) or (more formal) three pounds and seventy-five pence*

Some people now use the plural *pence* as a singular in informal speech; *pound* is sometimes used informally as a plural.

- *That’s two pounds and one **pence**, please.*
- *It cost me eight **pound** fifty.*

Singular forms are used in expressions like *a five-**pound** note* (see above). However, *pence* is often used instead of *penny* (*a five-**pence** stamp*).

## American money

There are 100 *cents* (¢) in a *dollar* ($). One-cent coins are called *pennies*; five-cent coins are *nickels*; ten-cent coins are *dimes*; a twenty-five cent coin is a *quarter*.

## Metric and non-metric measures

Britain uses not-metric measures (*miles*, *yards* and *feet*) for road distances; heights are often given in feet.

- *The car park’s straight on, about **500 yards** on the right.*
- *We are now flying at an altitude of **28,000 feet**.*

Metric measures are now standard for most other purposes, but non-metric measures are also sometimes used. The US generally uses non-metric units.

- *It’s **30 miles** to the nearest hospital.*
- *The lightest road bike ever weighs around **6 pounds**.*

Other English-speaking countries use the metric system. Approximate equivalents are as follows:

- *1 inch (1in) = 2.5cm*
- *12 inches = 1 foot* (30cm)
- *3 feet* (3ft) = 1 yard (90cm)
- *5,280 feet / 1,760 yards = 1 mile* (1.6km)
- *5 miles = 8km*
- *1 ounce (1oz) = 28gm*
- *16 ounces = 1 pound* (455gm)
- *2.2 pounds (2.2lb) = 1kg*
- *14 pounds* (14lb) = 1 stone (6.4kg) (BrE only)
- *1 British pint = 568ml*
- *1 US pint = 473ml*
- *8 pints (8pt) = 1 gallon*
- *1 British gallon = 4.55 litres*
- *1 US gallon = 3.78 litres*
- *1 acre = 4,840 square yards = 0.4 hectares*
- *1 square mile = 640 acres = 259 hectares*

## Area and volume

We say, for example, that a room is *twelve feet **by** fifteen feet*, or that a garden is *thirty metres **by** forty-eight metres*.

A room *twelve feet by twelve feet* can be called ***twelve feet square***; the total area is ***144 square feet***.

A container *2 metres by 2 metres by 3 metres* has a volume of *12 **cubic metres***.

## *a* and *per*

When we relate two different measures, we usually use *a*/*an*; *per* is often used in formal writing.

- *It costs two pounds **a** week.* (or *… £2 **per** week.*)
- *We’re doing seventy miles **an** hour.* (or *… 70 miles **per** hour / mph.*)

## Numbers not used as complements after *be*

Numbers are used as subjects or objects, but not usually as complements after *be* except in calculations, [(see here)](./numbers#spoken-calculations) below.

- *I’ve got three sisters.* (not *~~My sisters are three.~~*)
- *There are twelve of us in my family.* (More natural than *We are twelve …*)

## Spoken calculations

Common ways of saying calculations in British English are:

- 2 + 2 = 4:
  - *Two and two is/are four.* (informal)
  - *Two plus two equals/is four.* (formal)
- 7 − 4 = 3:
  - *Four from seven is/leaves three.* (informal)
  - *Seven take away four is/leaves three.* (informal)
  - *Seven minus four equals/is three.* (formal)
- 3 × 4 = 12:
  - *Three fours are twelve.* (informal)
  - *Three times four is twelve.* (informal)
  - *Three multiplied by four equals/is twelve.* (formal)
- 9 ÷ 3 = 3:
  - *Three(s) into nine goes three* (times). (informal, especially BrE)
  - *Nine divided by three equals/is three.* (formal)

## Example of a spoken calculation

Here, for interest, is a multiplication (146×281) together with all its steps, in the words that a British English speaker might have used as he/she was working it out on paper before the days of pocket calculators.

```
  146
× 281
-----
29200
11680
  146
-----
41026
```

*A hundred and forty-six times two hundred and eighty-one.*

- *beginning:* *Put down two noughts. Two sixes are twelve; put down two and carry one; two fours are eight and one are nine; two ones are two.*
- *next line:* *Put down one nought. Eight sixes are forty-eight; put down eight and carry four; eight fours are thirty-two and four is thirty-six; put down six and carry three; eight ones are eight and three is eleven.*
- *next line:* *One times 146 is 146.*
- *addition:* *Six and nought and nought is six; eight and four and nought is twelve; put down two and carry one; six and two are eight and one is nine and one is ten; put down nought and carry one; nine and one are ten and one is eleven; put down one and carry one; two and one are three and one are four.*
- *total:* *forty-one thousand and twenty-six.*

Note how *is* and *are* can often be used interchangeably.
