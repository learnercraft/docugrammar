# ‘social’ language

Every language has fixed expressions which are used on particular social occasions – for example when people meet, leave each other, go on a journey, sit down to meals and so on. Here are some of the most important English expressions of this kind.

## Introductions

Common ways of introducing strangers to each other are:

- *Jack, do you know Ella? Ella, this is my friend Jack.*
- *Sophie, I don’t think you’ve met Laura.*
- *I don’t think you two know each other, do you?*
- *Can/May I introduce Ben Willis?* (more formal)

When people are introduced, they may say *Pleased/Nice to meet you.* (formal), or *Hello*/*Hi* (informal). Americans often say **How are you?**

 People who are introduced often shake hands.

## Greetings

When getting together with people (formal):

- *(Good) morning/afternoon/evening.*

When getting together with people (informal):

- *Hello.*
- *Hi.* (very informal)

When leaving people:

- *Goodnight.*
- *Bye.* (informal)
- *Goodbye.*
- *Bye-bye.* (often used to and by children)
- *Cheers.* (informal – British only)
- *Take care.* (informal)
- *See you.* (informal)
- *See you later / tomorrow / next week, etc* (informal)
- *It was nice to meet / meeting you.*

Note that *Good day* is very unusual (except in Australian English in its colloquial form *G’day*), and *Goodnight* is used only when leaving people, not when getting together with them.

## Asking about health, etc

When we meet people we know, we often ask politely about their health or their general situation.

- *How are you?*
- *How are things? / How’s things?* (informal)
- *How’s it going?* (informal)
- *How (are) you doing?*

Formal answers:

- *Very well, thank you. And you?*
- *Fine, thank you.*

Informal answers:

- *Fine/Great, thanks.*
- *OK.*
- *So-so.* (not *~~So and so.~~*)
- *All right.*
- *Not too bad.*
- *(I’m) good.*
- *(It) could be worse.*
- *Mustn’t grumble.* (BrE)
- *Can’t complain.*

British people do not usually ask *How are you?* when they are introduced to people. And neither British nor American people begin letters to strangers by asking about health [(see here)](./../../grammar/written-texts/correspondence-letters).

## Special greetings

Greetings for special occasions are:

- *Happy birthday!* (or Many happy returns!)
- *Happy New Year / Easter!*
- *Happy/Merry Christmas!*
- *Happy anniversary!*
- *Congratulations on your exam results / new job, etc* (not *~~Congratulation on …~~*)

## Small talk

British people often begin polite conversations by talking about the weather.

- *‘Nice day, isn’t it?’ ‘Lovely.’*

## Getting people’s attention

*Excuse me!* is commonly used to attract somebody’s attention, or to call a waiter in a restaurant. We do not normally say *Excuse me, sir/madam* [(see here)](./names-and-titles-daniel-mr-lewis#first-name-also-christian-name-ame-also-given-name-or-forename) b).

## Apologies

British people say *Excuse me* before interrupting or disturbing somebody, and *Sorry* after doing so. Compare:

- ***Excuse me**. Could I get past? Oh, **sorry**, did I step on your foot?*
- ***Excuse me**, could you tell me the way to the station?*

Americans also use *Excuse me* to apologise after disturbing somebody.

*I beg your pardon* is a more formal way of saying ‘Sorry’.

- ***I beg your pardon**. I didn’t realise this was your seat.*

## Asking people to repeat

If people do not hear or understand what is said, they may say **Sorry?** *(BrE)*, *What?* (informal, not very polite), *(I beg your) pardon?* or **Pardon me?** *(AmE)*.

- *‘Mike’s on the phone.’ ‘**Sorry?’** ‘I said Mike’s on the phone.’*
- *‘See you tomorrow.’ ‘**What?’** ‘See you tomorrow.’*
- *‘You’re going deaf.’ ‘**I beg your pardon?’***

## Journeys, etc

Common ways of wishing people a good journey are:

- *Have a good/nice trip.*
- *Have a good journey.* (BrE)
- *Safe journey home.* (BrE)

After a journey (for example when we meet people at the airport or station), we may say:

- *Did you have a good journey/trip/flight?*
- *How was the journey/trip/flight?*

If somebody is leaving for an evening out or some kind of pleasant event, people might say *Have a good time!* or *Enjoy yourself!* (especially in American English sometimes just *Enjoy!*). *Good luck!* is used before examinations or other difficult or dangerous events.

When people return home, their friends or family may say *Welcome back/home*.

## Holidays

Before somebody starts a holiday, we may say:

- *Have a good/nice holiday (AmE *… vacation*). or Have a good/nice time.*

When the holiday is over, we may say:

- *Did you have a good/nice holiday/vacation?*

## Meals

We do not have fixed expressions for the beginnings and ends of meals. It is common for guests or family members to say something complimentary about the food during the meal (for example *This is very nice*), and after (for example *That was lovely/delicious; thank you very much*). Some religious people say ‘grace’ (a short prayer) before and after meals. Waiters often say *Enjoy your meal* or just *Enjoy* after serving a customer.

## Drinking

When people begin drinking alcoholic drinks socially, they often raise their glasses and say something. Common expressions are *Cheers!* (BrE) and *Your health!* (AmE also *To your health*). When we drink to celebrate an occasion (such as a birthday, a wedding or a promotion), we often say *Here’s to …!*

- ***Here’s to** Lily!*
- ***Here’s to** the new job!*
- ***Here’s to** the happy couple!*

## Sending good wishes

Typical expressions are *Give my best wishes/regards/greetings/love to X*, *Remember me to X*, *Say hello to X for me*. When the wishes are passed on, common expressions are *X sends his/her best wishes/regards*, etc, *X says hello*.

## Sympathy

Common formulae in letters of sympathy (for example on somebody’s death) are *I was very/terribly/extremely sorry to hear about …* and *Please accept my deepest sympathy*.

## Invitations and visits

Invitations often begin:

- *Would you like to …?*

Possible replies:

- *Thank you very/so much. That would be very nice/lovely.* (formal)
- *Thanks, that would be great.* (informal)
- *Sorry. I’m afraid I’m not free.*

It is normal to thank people for hospitality at the moment of leaving their places.

- *Thank you very/so much. That was a wonderful evening.*

## Offers and replies

Offers often begin *Would you like …?* or *Can/May I get/offer you …?* (more formal). Offers to do things for people can begin *Would you like me to …?*, *Can/May I …?* or *Shall I …?* (mainly BrE). Typical replies are *Yes, please*; *No, thank you*; *Thanks, I’d love some*; *I’d love to*; *That’s very nice/kind of you*.

Note that *thank you* can be used for accepting as well as refusing.

## Asking for things

We normally ask for things by using *yes*/*no* questions. [(see here)](./../../grammar/speech-and-spoken-exchanges/politeness-using-questions).

- *Could you lend me a pen?* (not *~~Please lend me a pen.~~*)

## Handing over things

We do not have an expression which is automatically used when we hand over things. We sometimes say *Here you are*, especially when we want to attract people’s attention to the fact that we are passing something to them.

- *‘Have you got a map of London?’ ‘I think so. Yes, **here you are**.’ ‘Thanks.’*

*There you go* is also possible in this situation, especially in AmE.

## Thanks

Common ways of thanking people are:

- *Thank you.*
- *Thank you very much.*
- *Thanks.* (informal)
- *Thanks very much / a lot.* (not *~~Thank you a lot.~~*)
- *Cheers.* (informal BrE)
- *Thank you so much.*

Possible replies to thanks are:

- *Not at all.* (formal)
- *Don’t mention it.*
- *That’s OK.* (informal)
- *You’re welcome.*
- *That’s (quite) all right.*
- *No problem.* (informal)

Note that British people do not always reply to thanks, especially thanks for small things.

## Sleep

When somebody goes to bed, people often say *Sleep well*. In the morning, we may ask *Did you sleep well?* or *How did you sleep?*
