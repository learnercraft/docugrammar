# Talking about age

## Use of *be*

We most often talk about people’s ages with *be* + number

- *He **is** thirty.* (not *~~He has thirty.~~*)

``or`` *be* + number + *years old* *(more formal: … *of age**).

- *He **is thirty years old** / of age.* (not *~~… thirty years.~~*)

We ask *How old are you?*, not normally *What is your age?*

## *be* + *… age*

Note the structure *be* + … *age* (without a preposition).

- *When I **was your age** I was working.* (not *~~When I was at your age …~~*)
- *The two boys **are the same age**.*
- *She’s **the same age** as me.*

## Prepositions

In other structures, *at* is common before *age*.

- *He could read **at the age** of three.* (not *~~… in the age …~~*)
- ***At your age** I already had a job.*
