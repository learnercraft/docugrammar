# Telling the time

## Saying what time it is

There are two common ways of saying what time it is.

- *8.05 = eight* (oh) five (or five past eight)
- *8.10 = eight ten* (or ten past eight)
- *8.15 = eight fifteen* (or a quarter past eight)
- *8.25 = eight twenty-five* (or twenty-five past eight)
- *8.30 = eight thirty* (or half past eight)
- *8.35 = eight thirty-five* (or twenty-five to nine)
- *8.45 = eight forty-five* (or a quarter to nine)
- *8.50 = eight fifty* (or ten to nine)
- *9.00 = nine o’clock*

Americans prefer to write a colon between the hours and the minutes: *8:50*.

People generally prefer to say *minutes past/to* for times between the five-minute divisions.

- *seven **minutes** past eight* (More natural than *seven past eight*.)
- *three **minutes** to nine* (More natural than *three to nine*.)

The expression *o’clock* is only used at the hour. Compare:

- *Wake me at seven **(o’clock)**.*
- *Wake me at ten past seven.* (not *~~… ten past seven o’clock.~~*)

*Past* is often dropped from *half past* in informal speech.

- *OK, see you at **half two**.* (= … half past two.)

In American English *after* is often used instead of *past* (e.g. *ten **after** six*); but Americans do not say *half after*. And in American English *of*, *before* and *till* are possible instead of *to* (e.g. *twenty-five **of** three*).

## Asking what time it is

Common ways of asking about time are:

- *What time is it?*
- *What’s the time?*
- *Have you got the time?* (informal)
- *Could you tell me the time?* (more formal)
- *What time do you make it?* (``or`` *What do you make the time?* BrE, meaning ‘What time is it by your watch?’)

## The twenty-four hour clock

The twenty-four hour clock is used mainly in timetables, programmes and official announcements. In ordinary speech, people usually use the twelve-hour clock. Compare:

- *Last check-in time is **20.15**.*  
  *I’m seeing Oliver at **a quarter past eight** this evening.*
- *The next train from Platform 5 is the **17.30** departure for Carlisle.*  
  *‘What time do you stop work?’ ‘**Half past five**.’*
- *The meeting will begin at **fourteen hundred**.*  
  *Jack and I are meeting up at **two o’clock**.*

If necessary, times can be distinguished by using *in the morning*/*afternoon*/*evening*. In a more formal style, we can use *am* (= Latin *ante meridiem* – ‘before midday’) and *pm* (= *post meridiem* – ‘after midday’).

- *09.00 = nine o’clock **in the morning*** (or *nine **am***)
- *21.00 = nine o’clock **in the evening*** (or *nine **pm***)
