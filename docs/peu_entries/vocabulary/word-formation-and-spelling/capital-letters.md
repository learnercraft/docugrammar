# Capital letters

We use capital (big) letters at the beginning of the following kinds of words:

- the names of days, months and public holidays (but not usually seasons)
  - ***S**unday*
  - ***T**uesday*
  - ***M**arch*
  - ***S**eptember*
  - ***E**aster*
  - ***C**hristmas*
  - (but normally *summer*, *autumn*)

- the names of people, institutions and places, including stars and planets
  - ***J**ohn*
  - *the **F**oreign **O**ffice*
  - *the **U**nited **S**tates*
  - ***T**he **S**uper **C**inema*
  - *the **P**ole **S**tar*
  - ***M**ary*
  - ***N**orth **A**frica*
  - ***T**he **R**itz **H**otel*
  - *the **F**ar **E**ast*
  - ***M**ars*
  - *the **S**miths*
  - ***C**anada*
  - ***O**xford **U**niversity* (Compare *He teaches at a university.*)
  - (but normally *the earth*, *the sun*, *the moon*)

  Words derived from people’s names have capitals if they refer to the people.

  - ***S**hakespearean drama* (but *to pasteurise*): this refers to a chemical process, not directly to the scientist Pasteur

- people’s titles
  - ***M**r Smith*
  - ***C**olonel Webb*
  - ***P**rofessor Blake*
  - *the **M**anaging **D**irector*
  - ***D**r Jones*
  - *the **P**rime **M**inister is attending the summit* (Compare *How is the Swedish prime minister elected?*)

- nouns and adjectives referring to nationalities and regions, languages, ethnic groups and religions
  - *He’s **R**ussian.*
  - ***C**atalan cooking*
  - *I speak **G**erman.*
  - *She’s **J**ewish.*
  - ***J**apanese history*
  - *He’s a **S**ikh.*

- the names of newspapers and magazines
  - ***I**nternational **H**erald **T**ribune*
  - ***N**ew **S**cientist*

  The article *the* in such names is usually, but not always, capitalised.

  - *I read it in **T**he/**t**he Guardian.*

- the first word (and often other important words) in the titles of books, films and plays
  - ***T**he **S**py who **L**oved **M**e*
  - ***G**one with the **W**ind*
  - ***A** **M**idsummer **N**ight’s **D**ream*
