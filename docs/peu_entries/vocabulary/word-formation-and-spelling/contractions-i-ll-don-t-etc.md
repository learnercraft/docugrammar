# Contractions: I’ll, don’t, etc

## General rules

Contractions are forms like *I’ve*, *don’t*, in which an auxiliary verb is combined with another word. There are two kinds.

:::tip[Grammar]

noun/pronoun, etc + (auxiliary) verb

:::

- ***I’m** tired.*
- *My **father’s** not very well.*
- *Do you know when **you’ll** arrive?*
- ***Where’s** the station?*
- ***I’ve** no idea.*
- ***There’s** a problem.*
- ***She’d** like to talk to you.*
- ***Somebody’s** coming.*
- ***Here’s** our bus.*

:::tip[Grammar]

(auxiliary) verb + *not*

:::

- *They **aren’t** ready.*
- *You **won’t** be late, will you?*
- *I **haven’t** seen him for ages.*
- ***Can’t** you swim?*

Contractions are formed with auxiliary verbs, and also with *be* and sometimes *have* when these are not auxiliary verbs.

The short form *’s* (= *is*/*has*) can be written after nouns (including proper names), question words, *here* and *now* as well as pronouns and unstressed *there*. The short forms *’ll*, *’d* and *’re* are commonly written after pronouns and unstressed *there*, but in other cases we more often write the full forms (especially in British English), even if the words would be contracted in pronunciation.

- *‘Your **mother will** (/ˈmʌðərl/) be surprised’, she said.*
- *I wondered **what had** (/ˈwɒtəd/) happened.*

Contractions are not usually written with double subjects.

- ***Jack and I have** decided to split up.* (not *~~Jack and I’ve decided …~~*)

The apostrophe*(’) goes in the same place as the letters that we leave out:*has not \= **hasn’t** (not *~~ha’snt~~*). But note that *shan’t* (BrE = *shall not*) and *won’t* (= ‘will not’) only have one apostrophe each.

Contractions are common and correct in informal writing: they represent the pronunciation of informal speech. They are not generally used in a formal style.

## Alternative contractions

Some negative expressions can have two possible contractions. For *she had not* we can say *she hadn’t* or *she’d not*; for *he will not* we can say *he won’t* or *he’ll not*. The two negative forms of *be* (e.g. *she isn’t* and *she’s not*) are both common. With other verbs, forms with *n’t* (e.g. *she hadn’t*) are more common in most cases in standard southern British English; they are the only forms normally used in American English. (Forms with *not* – e.g. *she’d not* – tend to be more common in northern and Scottish English.)

Double contractions are not normally written: **~~she’sn’t~~** is impossible.

## Position

Contractions in the first group (noun / pronoun / question word + auxiliary verb) do not normally come at the ends of clauses. Compare:

- ***I’m** late.*  
  *Yes, **you are**.* (not *~~Yes, you’re.~~*)
- ***I’ve** forgotten.*  
  *Yes, **you have**.* (not *~~Yes, you’ve.~~*)

Negative contractions can come at the ends of clauses.

- *They really **aren’t**.*
- *No, I **haven’t**.*

**Notes**

1. Do not confuse *it’s* (= *it is*/*has*) and *its* (possessive).
2. *Am not* is only normally contracted in questions to *aren’t* (/ɑːnt/).
    - *I’m late, aren’t I?*
3. Note the difference in pronunciation of *can’t* in British English (/kɑːnt/) and American English (/kænt/).
4. *Daren’t*, *mightn’t*, *oughtn’t*, *shan’t* and *usedn’t* are rare, especially in American English; *needn’t* is rare in American English.
5. In non-standard English, *ain’t* (pronounced /eɪnt/) is used as a contraction of *am not*, *are not*, *is not*, *have not* and *has not*.
    - *I ain’t going to tell him.*
    - *Don’t talk to me like that – you ain’t my boss.*
    - *‘It’s raining.’ ‘No it ain’t.’*
    - *I ain’t got no more cigarettes.*
    - *James ain’t been here for days.*
6. For the contraction *let’s*, [(see here)](./../../grammar/basic-clause-types/let-introducing-imperatives).
7. *May not* is not normally contracted: *mayn’t* is very rare.
