# -ic and -ical

Many adjectives end in *\-ic* or *\-ical*. There is no general rule to tell you which form is correct in a particular case.

## Some adjectives normally ending in *-ic*

- *academic*
- *algebraic*
- *arithmetic*
- *artistic*
- *athletic*
- *catholic*
- *despotic*

*Arithmetical*, *geometrical* and *pedagogical* also occur.

Some of these words ended in *\-ical* in older English (e.g. *fantastical*, *majestical*, *tragical*).

New adjectives which come into the language generally end in *\-ic*, except for those ending in *\-logical*.

## Differences of meaning

*Rhythmic* and *rhythmical* both exist with no difference of meaning. In a few other cases, both forms exist but with a meaning difference. See [*Word problems from A to Z*](../word-problems-from-a-to-z/word-problems-from-a-to-z-introduction) for *classic(al)*, *comic(al)*, *economic(al)*, *electric(al)*, *historic(al)*, *magic(al)* and *politic(al)*.

## Adverbs

Note that whether the adjective ends in *\-ic* or *\-ical*, the adverb ends in *\-ically**(pronounced /Éªkli/). The one common exception is *publicly**(not *~~publically~~*).

## Nouns ending in *-ics*

Many nouns ending in *\-ics* are singular (e.g. *physics*, *athletics*). Some can be either singular or plural (e.g. *mathematics*, *politics*). For details, [(see here)](./../../grammar/nouns-and-noun-phrases-agreement/irregular-and-special-plurals#plural-same-as-singular).
