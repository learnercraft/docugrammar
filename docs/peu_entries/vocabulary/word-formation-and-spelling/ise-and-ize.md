# -ise and -ize

Many English verbs and some nouns can be spelt with either *\-ise* or *\-ize*. In American English, *\-ize* is preferred in these cases. Examples:

- *bapt**ise**/bapt**ize*** (BrE), *bapt**ize*** (AmE)
- *computer**ise**/computer**ize*** (BrE), *computer**ize*** (AmE)
- *mechan**ise**/mechan**ize*** (BrE), *mechan**ize*** (AmE)
- *real**ise**/real**ize*** (BrE), *real**ize*** (AmE)

Most words of two syllables, and a few longer words, have *\-ise* in both British and American English. Examples:

- *advert**ise*** (not *~~advertize~~*)
- *adv**ise***
- *compr**ise***
- *comprom**ise***
- *desp**ise***
- *dev**ise***
- *disgu**ise***
- *enterpr**ise***
- *exerc**ise***
- *franch**ise***
- *improv**ise***
- *rev**ise***
- *superv**ise***
- *surpr**ise***
- *telev**ise***

*Capsize* has *\-ize* in both British and American English.

Note also *analyse* (AmE usually **analyze**) and *paralyse* (AmE *paralyze*).

If in doubt, remember that in British English *\-ise* is almost always acceptable. Some British usage guides claim that *\-ize* is ‘preferable’ in British English on etymological and phonetic grounds, but this is not correct.

For American English, consult an American dictionary.
