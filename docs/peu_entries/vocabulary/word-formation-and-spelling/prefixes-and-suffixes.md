- *phonology*
- *telescope*
- *micrometry*

## Negative words with no positive equivalent

Some words with negative prefixes have no positive opposite equivalent: for example, somebody can be *distressed*, but not **~~tressed~~**. Other examples:

- *dishevelled, disappoint, discard, disclose, disconcert, disfigure, dismiss, dispose, incessant, indelible, uncanny, uncouth, ungainly, unkempt, unnerved, unspeakable, unwieldy, unwitting*

## Productivity

Certain prefixes and suffixes are productive: they are often used to form new words. And some can be added to almost any word of the right grammatical kind.

- *I’m not **anti-tourists**; I just don’t want them in our town.*
- *The place has got a real **1970s-like** atmosphere.*

But most are limited to certain words or kinds of word, and cannot be used to invent new vocabulary items.

- (not *~~uncredible, subinteresting, considerage~~*) or *~~drinkless~~*
