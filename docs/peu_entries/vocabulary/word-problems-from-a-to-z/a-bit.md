# (a) bit

## Use

*A bit* is often used as an adverb with the same meaning as *a little* [(see here)](./../../grammar/determiners-quantifiers/a-little-and-a-few).

- *She’s **a bit** old to play with dolls, isn’t she?*
- *Can you drive **a bit** slower?*
- *Wait **a bit**.*

Note that when *a bit* and *a little* are used with non-comparative adjectives, the meaning is usually negative or critical.

- *a bit **tired***
- *a bit **expensive***
- *a little (too) **old***
- (but not *~~a bit kind, a little interesting~~*)

## *a bit of a*

*A bit of a* can be used before some nouns in an informal style. The meaning is similar to *rather a* [(see here)](./rather-adverb-of-degree-rather-good-etc).

- *He’s **a bit of a** fool, if you ask me.*
- *I’ve got **a bit of a** problem.*

## *not a bit*

The informal expression *not a bit* means ‘not at all’.

- *I’m **not a bit** tired.*
- *‘Do you mind if I put some music on?’ ‘**Not a bit**.’*
