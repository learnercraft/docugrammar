# (a)round and about

## Circular movement, etc: *(a)round*

We use both *round* and *around* (AmE usually **around**) for movement or position in a circle or a curve.

- *She walked **(a)round** the car and looked at the wheels.*
- *I’d like to travel **(a)round** the world.*
- *‘Where do you live?’ ‘Just **(a)round** the corner.’*

## Touring, distribution: *round*

We also use *round* or *around* (AmE usually **around**) to talk about going to all (or most) parts of a place, or giving things to everybody in a group.

- *We walked **(a)round** the old part of the town.*
- *Can I look **(a)round**?*
- *Could you pass the cups **(a)round**, please?*

## Indefinite movement and position

We use *around* or *about* (AmE usually **around**) to refer to movements or positions that are not very clear or definite: ‘here and there’, ‘in lots of places’, ‘in different parts of’, ‘somewhere in’ and similar ideas.

- *The children were running **around/about** everywhere.*
- *Stop standing **around/about** and do some work.*
- *‘Where’s Jack?’ ‘Somewhere **around/about**.’*
- *I like doing odd jobs **around/about** the house.*

We also use these words in some common expressions to talk about time-wasting or silly activity.

- *Stop **fooling around/about**. We’re late.*

## Approximately

*About* and *around* can both mean ‘approximately’, ‘not exactly’. *About* is more common than *around* in British English.

- *There were **about/around** fifty people there.*
- *‘What time shall I come?’ ‘**About/Around** eight.’*
