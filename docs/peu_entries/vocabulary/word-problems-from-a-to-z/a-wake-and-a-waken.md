# (a)wake and (a)waken

## Use

*Wake* is the most common of these four verbs. It can mean ‘stop sleeping’ or ‘make (somebody else) stop sleeping’. It is often followed by *up*, especially when it means ‘stop sleeping’.

- *I **woke up** three times in the night.*
- ***Wake up**! It’s time to go to work.* (not *~~Wake! …~~*)
- *Could you **wake** me **(up)** at half past six?*

*Waken* is a more literary alternative to *wake (up)*.

- *The princess **did** not **waken** for a hundred years.*
- *Then the prince **wakened** her with a kiss.*

*Awake* and *awaken* are also rather literary words. They are most often used to talk about the waking of emotions, understanding, etc.

- *I slowly **awoke** to the danger that threatened me.*
- *At first I paid little attention, but slowly my interest **awoke**.*
- *The sound of the church clock **awakened** a half-buried memory.*

## *awake* and *asleep* (adjectives)

In informal British English the adjectives *awake* and *asleep* are more common in predicative position (after *be*) than the verb forms *waking* and *sleeping*.

- *Is the baby **awake** yet?*
- *Everyone was **asleep** when I got home.*
