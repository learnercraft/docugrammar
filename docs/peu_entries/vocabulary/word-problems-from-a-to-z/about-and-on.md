# about and on

Compare:

- *a book for children **about** Africa and its peoples*  
  *a textbook **on** African history*
- *a conversation **about** money*  
  *a lecture **on** economics*

We use *about* to talk about ordinary, more general kinds of communication. *On* suggests that a book, talk, etc is more serious, suitable for specialists.
