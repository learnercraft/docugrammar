# across, over and through

## On/to the other side of (a line): *across* and *over*

*Across* and *over* can both be used to mean ‘on or to the other side of a line, river, road, bridge, etc’.

- *His village is just **across**/**over** the border.*
- *See if you can jump **across**/**over** the stream.*

## High things: *over* preferred

We prefer *over* to say ‘on/to the other side of something high’.

- *Why are you climbing **over** the wall?* (not *~~… across the wall?~~*)

## Flat areas: *across* preferred

We usually prefer *across* to say ‘on/to the other side of a flat area or surface’.

- *He walked right **across** the desert.*
- *It took them six hours to row **across** the lake.*

## The adverb *over (to)*

Note that the adverb *over* has a wider meaning than the preposition *over*. We often use *over (to)* for short journeys.

- *I’m going **over to** Jack’s.*
- *Shall we drive **over** and see your mother?*

## *across* and *through*

The difference between *across* and *through* is like the difference between *on* and *in*. *Through*, unlike *across*, is used for a movement in a three-dimensional space, with things on all sides. Compare:

- *We walked **across** the ice.* (We were **on** the ice.)  
  *I walked **through** the wood.* (I was **in** the wood.)
- *We drove **across** the desert.*  
  *We drove **through** several towns.*
