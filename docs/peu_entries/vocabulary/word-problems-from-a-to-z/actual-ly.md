# actual(ly)

## Meaning and use

*Actual* means ‘real’; *actually* means ‘really’ or ‘in fact’.

They are used to make things clearer, more precise or more definite.

- *It’s over 100 kilos. Let me look. Yes, the **actual** weight is 108 kilos.*
- *I’ve got a new job. **Actually**, they’ve made me sales manager.*
- *‘Did you enjoy your trip?’ ‘Very much, **actually**.’*

*Actual* and *actually* often introduce surprising or unexpected information.

- *It takes me an hour to drive to work, although the **actual** distance is only 20 miles.*
- *She was so angry that she **actually** tore up the letter.*
- *‘How did you get on with my car?’ ‘Well, **actually**, I’m terribly sorry, I’m afraid I had a crash.’*
- *He’s twelve, but he **actually** still believes in Father Christmas.*

They can be used to correct mistakes or misunderstandings.

- *The book says she died aged 47, but her **actual** age was 43.*
- *‘Hello, Jack. Nice to see you.’ ‘**Actually**, my name’s Andy.’*

*Actually* is more common in British than American English.

## ‘false friends’

*Actual* and *actually* are ‘false friends’ for people who speak some languages. They do not mean the same as, for example, *actuel(lement), aktuell*, or *attual(ment)e.* We express these ideas with *present*, *current*, *up to date*; *at this moment*, *now*, *at present*.

- *What’s our **current** financial position?* (not *~~… our actual financial position?~~*)
- *In 1840 the population of Ireland was higher than it is **now.*** (not *~~… than it is actually.~~*)
