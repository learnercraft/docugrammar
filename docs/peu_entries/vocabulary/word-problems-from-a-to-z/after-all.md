# after all

## Two meanings

*After all* can mean ‘in spite of what was said before’ or ‘contrary to what was expected’. Position: usually at the end of a clause.

- *I’m sorry. I know I said I would help you, but I can’t **after all**.*

Another meaning is ‘we mustn’t forget that …’, introducing an argument or reason which may have been forgotten. Position: at the beginning or end of a clause.

- *Of course you’re tired. **After all**, you were up all night.*

## Not used for ‘finally’
