# ago

## Word order: *six weeks ago*

*Ago* follows an expression of time.

- *I met her **six weeks ago**.* (not *~~… ago six weeks.~~*)
- *a long **time ago***

## Tenses

An expression with *ago* refers to a finished time, and is normally used with a past tense, not a present perfect [(see here)](./../../grammar/past-and-perfect-tenses/present-perfect-basic-information#repetition-up-to-now-i-ve-written-six-emails).

- *She **phoned** a few minutes ago.* (not *~~She has phoned …~~*)
- *‘Where’s Mike? ’ ‘He **was working** outside ten minutes ago.’*

## The difference between *ago* and *for*

*Ago* says how long before the present something happened; *for* (with a past tense) says how long it lasted. Compare:

- *He died **three years ago**.* (= three years before now) (not *~~He died for three years.~~*) or *~~… for three years ago.~~*

- *He was ill **for three years** before he died.* (= His illness lasted three years.)

## *ago* and *before* with time expressions: counting back

We use *ago* with a past tense and a time expression to ‘count back’ from the present; to say how long before now something happened.

We can use *before* in the same way (with a past perfect tense) to count back from a past moment. Compare:

- *I met that woman in Scotland **three years ago**.* (not *~~… three years before / before three years.~~*)
- *When we got talking, I found out that I had been at school with her husband **ten years before**.* (not *~~… ten years ago.~~*)
