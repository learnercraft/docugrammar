# alike

The adjective *alike* means ‘like each other’. Compare:

- *The two boys are **alike** in looks, but not in personality.*
- *He’s **like** his brother.* (not *~~He’s alike his brother.~~*)

*Alike* is not often used before a noun [(see here)](./../../grammar/adjectives/adjectives-normal-position). Compare:

- *His two daughters are very much **alike**.*
- *He’s got two very **similar-looking** daughters.* (not *~~… alike daughters.~~*)
