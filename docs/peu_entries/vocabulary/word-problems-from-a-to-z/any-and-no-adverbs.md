# any and no: adverbs

## *any* and *no* with comparatives

*Any* can modify comparatives. This happens mostly in questions and negative sentences, and after *if* (also [(see here)](./../../grammar/basic-clause-types/non-affirmative-words-anybody-ever-yet-etc).

- *Can you go **any faster**?*
- *You don’t look **any older** than your daughter.* (= You don’t look at all older …)
- ***If** I were **any younger**, I’d fall in love with you.*

*No* can also be used in this way (but not *some*).

- *I’m afraid the weather’s **no better** than yesterday.*

## *any/no different*

We can also use *any* and *no* with *different*.

- *This school isn’t **any different** from the last one.*
- *‘Is Jack any better?’ ‘**No different.** Still very ill.’*

## *any/no good; any/no use*

Note the expressions *any good/use* and *no good/use*.

- *Was the film **any good**?*
- *This watch is **no use**. It keeps stopping.*
