- *I’ll remember that day **as long as I live**.* (not *~~… as long as I will live.~~*)

## Conditions

*As*/*so long as* is often used to state conditions.

- *You can take my car **as**/**so long as** **you drive carefully**.* (= … on condition that you drive carefully.)

## Emphatic use

Before a number, *as long as* can be used to suggest great length.
