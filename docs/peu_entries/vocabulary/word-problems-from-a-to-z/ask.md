# ask

## *ask* and *ask for*

:::tip[Grammar]

*ask for*: ask somebody to give something

:::

:::tip[Grammar]

*ask* without *for*: ask somebody to tell something

:::

Compare:

- *Don’t **ask** me **for** money.* (not *~~Don’t ask me money.~~*)  
  *Don’t **ask** me my name.* (More common than *Don’t ask me for my name.*)
- ***Ask for** the menu.*  
  ***Ask** the price.*

*Ask* is sometimes used without *for* when talking about asking for sums of money, especially in connection with buying, selling and renting.

- *They’**re asking £500** a month including tax.*
- *‘How much is the car?’ ‘I’**m asking fifteen hundred**.’*

Note also the expressions *ask a lot of somebody*, *ask too much of somebody*, *ask a favour of somebody* and *ask (for) permission*.

## Infinitive structures
