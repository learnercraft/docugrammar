# back (adverb) and again

*Back* and *again* can be used with similar meanings, but there are some differences.

## *back* with a verb

With a verb, we use *back* to suggest a return to an earlier situation, a movement in the opposite direction to an earlier movement, and similar ideas. *Again* is not normally used in this way with a verb.

- *Give me my watch **back**.* (not *~~Give me my watch again.~~*)
- *I’m taking this meat **back** to the shop.* (not *~~I’m taking this meat to the shop again.~~*)

## *again* with a verb

With a verb, *again* usually suggests repetition. Compare:

- *That was lovely. Can you play it **again**?*  
  *When I’ve recorded your voice I’ll play it **back**.*
- *Sam was really bad-mannered. I’m never going to invite him **again**.*  
  *She comes to our parties but she never invites us **back**.*
- *I don’t think he got your email. You’d better write **again**.*  
  *If I write to you, will you write **back**?*

Note the difference between *sell back* (to the same person) and *sell again*.

- *The bike you sold me is too small. Can I **sell** it **back** to you?*
- *If we buy this house and then have to move somewhere else, how easy will it be to **sell** it **again**?*

## Cases when *back* is not used

When the verb itself already expresses the idea of ‘return to an earlier situation’ or ‘movement in the opposite direction’, *back* is not generally used.

- *Stefan can never **return** to his country.* (More natural than *Stefan can never return back …*)
- *Who opened the window? Could you **close** it, please?* (not *~~… close it back …~~*)

However, *again* can be used to emphasise the idea of ‘return to an earlier situation’.

- *Stefan can never **return** to his country **again**.*
- *Who opened the window? Could you **close** it **again**, please?*

## Adverb particles, etc

With adverb particles and prepositional phrases, we can use both *back* and *again* to suggest ‘return to an earlier situation’, etc.

- *I stood up, and then I sat **(back) down (again)**.*
- *He tasted the apple and spat it **(back) out (again)**.*
- *Go **(back) to sleep (again)**.*
- *I’ll be **(back) in the office (again)** on Monday.*

## *ring*/*call back*

Note that *ring back* (British English only) and *call back* can be used to mean both ‘return a phone call’ and ‘repeat a phone call’.

- *‘She’s not here just now.’ ‘Ask her to **ring/call** me **back**.’* (= return my call)
- *‘I haven’t got time to talk now.’ ‘OK, I’ll **ring/call back** later.’* (= ring again)

## Word order

*Back* is an adverb particle [(see here)](./../../grammar/adverbs-and-adverbials/adverb-particles-up-down-back-away-etc), and can usually go between a verb and its object, unless this is a pronoun [(see here)](./../../grammar/verbs/two-part-verbs-phrasal-verbs#word-order-with-objects). *Again* cannot.

- *Take **back your money** – I don’t want it.* (or Take **your money back** …)
- *Count **the money again**, please.* (not *~~Count again the money …~~*)
