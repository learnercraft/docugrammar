# before: adverb

## ‘at any time before now/then’

We can use *before* to mean ‘at any time before now’. In British English, a present perfect tense is normally used.

- *I think **I’ve seen** this film **before**.*
- ***Have** you ever **been** here **before**?*

*Before* can also mean ‘at any time before then – before the past moment that we are talking about’. In this case a past perfect tense is used.

- *She realised that she **had seen** him **before**.*

## Counting back from a past time: *eight years before*

We also use *before* after a time expression to ‘count back’ from a past moment – to say how much earlier something else had happened. A past perfect tense is normally used.

- *When I went back to the town that I **had left eight years before**, everything was different.* (not *~~… that I had left before eight years …~~*)

To count back from the present, we use *ago*, not *before* [(see here)](./ago).

- *I left school **four years ago**.* (not *~~… four years before / before four years~~*)

## *before*, *before that* and *first*

*Before* is not generally used alone to mean ‘first’ or ‘before that happens’. Instead we use *first* or *before that.*

- *I want to get married one day. But **before that** / **first**, I want to travel.* (not *~~… But before, I want to travel.~~*)
