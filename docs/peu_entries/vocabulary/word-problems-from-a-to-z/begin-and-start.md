# begin and start

## Meaning; formality

*Begin* and *start* can both be used with the same meaning.

- *I **began**/**started** teaching when I was 24.*
- *If Hannah doesn’t come soon, let’s **begin**/**start** without her.*

We generally prefer *begin* when we are using a more formal style. Compare:

- *We will **begin** the meeting with a message from the President.*
- *Damn! It’**s starting** to rain.*

## Cases where *begin* is not possible

*Start* (but not *begin*) is used to mean:

1. ‘start a journey’

    - *I think we ought to **start** at six, while the roads are empty.*
2. ‘start working’ (for machines)

    - *The car won’t **start**.*
3. ‘make something start’

    - *How do you **start** the washing machine?*
    - *The President’s wife fired the gun to **start** the race.*
