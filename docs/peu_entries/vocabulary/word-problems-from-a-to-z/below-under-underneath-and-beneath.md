# below, under, underneath and beneath

## ‘lower than’: *below* or *under*

The prepositions *below* and *under* can both mean ‘lower than’.

- *Look in the cupboard **below**/**under** the sink.*

## Not directly under: *below*

We prefer *below* when one thing is not directly under another.

- *The climbers stopped 300m **below** the top of the mountain.*
- *A moment later the sun had disappeared **below** the horizon.*

## Covered: *under*

We prefer *under* when something is covered or hidden by what is over it, and when things are touching.

- *I think the cat’s **under** the bed.*
- *What are you wearing **under** your sweater?*
- *The whole village is **under** water.* (not *~~… below water.~~*)

## Measurements: *below*

*Below* is used in measurements of temperature and height, and in other cases where we think of a vertical scale.

- *The temperature is three degrees **below** zero.*
- *Parts of Holland are **below** sea level.*
- *The plane came down **below** the clouds.*
- *She’s well **below** average in intelligence.*

## ‘less than’: *under*

We usually use *under*, not *below*, to mean ‘less/fewer than’ or ‘younger than’.

- *There were **under** twenty people at the lecture.*
- *You can’t see this film if you’re **under** 18.*

## *underneath*

*Underneath* is sometimes used as a preposition instead of *under*, but only for physical position. Compare:

- *There’s a mouse **under(neath)** the piano.*
- *He’s still **under** 18.* (not *~~… underneath 18.~~*)

## *beneath*

*Beneath* is used mostly in a rather literary style.

- *The ship sank slowly **beneath** the waves.*

It is common before abstract nouns in some fixed expressions.

- *He acts as if I was **beneath his notice**.* (= not worth considering)
- *Her behaviour is **beneath contempt**.* (= really disgraceful)

## Adverbs

*Below* can be used as an adverb.

- *We looked over the cliff at the waves crashing on the rocks **below**.*

*Under* can be used as an adverb particle [(see here)](./../../grammar/adverbs-and-adverbials/adverb-particles-up-down-back-away-etc) with some verbs.

- *A lot of businesses are **going under** because of the economic crisis.*

In other cases we prefer *underneath* for adverbial use.

- *I can’t take my sweater off – I haven’t got anything on **underneath**.* (not *~~… anything on under.~~*)

In a book or a paper, *see below* means ‘look at something written later in the text’.

:::note

The difference between *above* and *over* is similar to the difference between *below* and *under*. [(see here)](./above-and-over) for details.
