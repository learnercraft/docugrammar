# beside and besides

*Beside* is a preposition meaning ‘at the side of’, ‘by’, ‘next to’.

- *They lived in a little house **beside** the river.*

*Besides* can be used like *as well as* [(see here)](./as-well-as), when we add new information to what is already known.

- ***Besides** literature, we have to study history and philosophy.*
- *Who was at the party **besides** Jack and the Bensons?*

*Besides* can also be used informally as a discourse marker [(see here)](./../../grammar/speech-and-spoken-exchanges/discourse-markers-in-speech#focusing) meaning ‘also’, ‘as well’, ‘in any case’. It is often used in speech to add a stronger, more conclusive argument to what has gone before. In this case, *besides* usually goes at the beginning of a clause.

- *I don’t like those shoes; **besides**, they’re too expensive.*
- *It’s too late to go out now. **Besides**, it’s starting to rain.*
