# better

## ‘recovered’

When *better* means ‘recovered from an illness’, it can be used with *completely* or *quite* (unlike other comparative adjectives).

- *Don’t start work again until you’re **completely better**.*

## Correcting mistakes

We do not normally use *better* to correct mistakes.

- *She’s gone to Hungary – or **rather**, Poland.* (not *~~… or better, Poland.~~*)

:::note

For the structure *had better*, [(see here)](./../../grammar/modal-auxiliary-verbs/weaker-obligation-had-better).
