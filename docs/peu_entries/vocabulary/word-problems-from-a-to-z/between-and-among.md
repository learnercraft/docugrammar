# between and among

## *between* two

We say that something is *between* two people, things, or groups of things.

- *a long valley **between** high mountains*

*Between* is often used to talk about distances or intervals.

*Between* is common before *each*.

- *There seems to be less and less time **between each** birthday.*

## *between* or *among* more than two

We usually say that somebody or something is *between* several clearly separate people or things. We prefer *among* when somebody or something is in a group, a crowd or a mass of people or things which we do not see separately. Compare:

- *Our house is **between the woods**, **the river and the village**.*  
  *His house is hidden **among the trees**.*
- *I saw something **between the wheels** of the car.*  
  *Your passport is somewhere **among all these papers**.*

*Among* is normal before a singular (uncountable) noun.

- *They found an envelope full of money **among all the rubbish**.*

## Dividing and sharing; *difference*

We can talk about *dividing* or *sharing* things *between* or *among* more than two people or groups.

- *He **divided** all his money **between**/**among** his children and grandchildren.*
- *We **shared** the work **between**/**among** the five of us.*

We normally use *between* after *difference*.

- *What’s the **difference between** ‘between’ and ‘among’?*

## ‘one of’, etc

*Among* can mean ‘one of’, ‘some of’ or ‘included in’.
