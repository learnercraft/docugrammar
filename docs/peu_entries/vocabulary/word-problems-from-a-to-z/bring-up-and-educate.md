# bring up and educate

*Bring up* and the noun *upbringing* are mostly used for the moral and social training that children receive at home. *Educate* and *education* are used for the intellectual and other training that people get at school and university.

- *Lucy was **brought up** by her aunt and **educated** at the local school.*
- *Their kids are very badly **brought up** – always screaming and fighting.* (not *~~Their kids are very badly educated …~~*)
- *Which is better: a good **upbringing** and a bad **education**, or the opposite?*
