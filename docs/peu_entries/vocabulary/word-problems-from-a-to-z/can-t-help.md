# can’t help

If you say that you *cannot*/*can’t help* doing something (especially in British English), you mean that you can’t stop yourself, even if you don’t want to do it.

- *She’s a selfish woman, but somehow you **can’t help** liking her.*
- *Excuse me – I **couldn’t help** overhearing what you said.*
- *Sorry I broke the cup – I **couldn’t help** it.*

*Can’t help* can be followed by *but* + infinitive without *to* [(see here)](./but-meaning-except#verbs-after-but), with the same meaning as *can’t help …ing*. This is common in American English.

- *I **can’t help but wonder** what I should do next.*
