# care: take care (of), care (about) and care for

## *take care of*

*Take care of* normally means ‘look after’ or ‘take responsibility for’.

- *Nurses **take care of** sick people.*
- *It’s no good giving Daniel a rabbit: he’s too young to **take care of** it.*
- *Ms Savage **takes care of** marketing, and I’m responsible for production.*

*Take care* (without a preposition) means ‘be careful’. Some people use it as a formula when saying goodbye.

- ***Take care** when you’re crossing the road, children.*
- *‘Bye, Ruth.’ ‘Bye, Mike. **Take care**.’*

## *care (about)*

*Care (about)* is used to say whether you feel something is important to you. This is very common in negative sentences. *About* is used before an object, but is usually left out before a conjunction.

- *Most people **care about** other people’s opinions.* (not *~~… take care of / care for other people’s opinions~~*)
- *I don’t **care whether** it rains – I’m happy.*
- *‘I’ll never speak to you again.’ ‘I **don’t care**.’*
- *‘Your mother’s upset with you.’ ‘I **couldn’t care less**.’* (= I don’t care at all.)

## *care for*

*Care for* can be used to mean ‘look after’.

- *He spent years **caring for** his sick mother.*

Another meaning is ‘like’ or ‘be fond of’, but this is not very common in modern English.

- *I don’t much **care for** strawberries.*
