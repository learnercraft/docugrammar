# city and town

Most people simply use *city* to talk about large and important towns – examples in the UK are Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool and London.

*City* can be used in a more exact way to talk about a town that has been given a special status by the king or queen (in Britain) or by the state (in some other English-speaking countries).

*The City* is also a name for London’s financial centre.

- *I’m not sure what his job is: something in **The City**.*

The two words can be used more or less interchangeably in American English, with *city* often preferred in more prestigious contexts. Compare:

- *The **City** of Pasadena is governed by a Mayor and a **City** Council.* (not *~~The town of Pasadena is governed …~~*)
- *Pasadena is a small **town** on the outskirts of Houston.* (not *~~… a small city …~~*)
