# close and shut

## Use

*Close* /kləʊz/ and *shut* can often be used with the same meaning.

- *Open your mouth and **close**/**shut** your eyes.*
- *I can’t **close**/**shut** the window. Can you help me?*
- *The shop **closes**/**shuts** at five o’clock.*

You can *shut*, but not *close*, somebody/something in or out of a place.

## Past participles

The past participles *closed* and *shut* can be used as adjectives.

*Shut* is not usually used before a noun.

- *a **closed door*** (not *~~a shut door~~*)
- ***closed eyes*** (not *~~shut eyes~~*)

## Cases where *close* is preferred

We prefer *close* for slow movements (like flowers closing at night), and *close* is more common in a formal style.

- *As we watched, he **closed** his eyes for the last time.*

Compare:

- ***Close** your mouth, please.* (dentist to patient)
- ***Shut** your mouth!* (a rude way of saying ‘Be quiet!’)

We *close* roads, railways, etc (channels of communication). And we *close* (= end) letters, bank accounts, meetings, etc.
