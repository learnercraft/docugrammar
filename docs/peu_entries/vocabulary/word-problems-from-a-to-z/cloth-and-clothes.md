# cloth and clothes

*Cloth* (pronounced /klɒθ/) is material made from wool, cotton, etc, used for making clothes, curtains, soft furnishings and so on. (In informal English, it is more common to say *material* or *fabric*.)

- *His suits were made of the most expensive **cloth**.*

*A cloth* is a piece of material used for cleaning, covering things, etc.

- *Could you pass me **a cloth**? I’ve spilt some milk on the floor.*

*Clothes* (pronounced /kləʊðz/) are things you wear: skirt, trousers, etc. *Clothes* has no singular; instead of *~~a clothe~~*, we say *something to wear* or *an article* / *a piece of clothing*.

- *I must buy some new **clothes**; I haven’t got anything to wear.*
