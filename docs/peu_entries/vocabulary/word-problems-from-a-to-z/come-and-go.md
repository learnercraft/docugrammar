# come and go

## Speaker’s/hearer’s position

We use *come* for movements to the place where the speaker or hearer is.

- *‘Maria, would you **come** here, please?’ ‘I’**m coming**.’* (not *~~… I’m going.~~*)
- *When did you **come** to live here?*
- *(on the phone): Can I **come** and see you?*

We use *go* for movements to other places.

- *I want to **go** and live in Greece.*
- *Let’s **go** and see Daniel and Chloe.*
- *In 1577, he **went** to study in Rome.*

## Speaker’s/hearer’s past or future position

We can use *come* for a movement to a place where the speaker or hearer already was or will be at the time of the movement. Compare:

- *What time did I **come** to see you in the office yesterday?*  
  *I **went** to Jack’s office yesterday, but he wasn’t in.*
- *Will you **come** and visit me in hospital when I have my operation?*  
  *He’s **going** into hospital next week.*
- *Sarah can’t **come** to your birthday party.*  
  *She’s **going** to see her mother.*

## Joining a movement

*Come (with)* can be used to talk about joining a movement of the speaker’s/hearer’s, even if *go* is used for the movement itself.

- *We’re **going** to a concert tonight. Would you like to **come** with us?*

## Somebody else’s position

Sometimes when we are talking about somebody else (not the speaker or hearer), that person can become the centre of our attention. In that case, we use *come* for movements to the place where he/she is (or was or will be). This often happens in stories.

- *He waited till four o’clock, but she didn’t **come**.*

## *come to*; *come from*

*Come to* can mean *arrive at*.

- *Go straight on till you **come to** a crossroads.*

*Come from* is used (in the present) to say where people’s homes are or were.

- *She **comes from** Scotland, but her mother’s Welsh.*
- *Originally I **come from** Hungary, but I’ve lived here for twenty years.* (not *~~Originally I came from Hungary …~~*)

:::note
