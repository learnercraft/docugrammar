# control

*Control* is a ‘false friend’ for people who speak some languages. It generally means *manage*, *direct*, not *check* or *inspect*. Compare:

- *The crowd was too big for the police to **control**.* (= … to keep in order.)  
  *The police were **checking** everybody’s papers.* (not *~~… controlling everybody’s papers.~~*)
- *I found the car difficult to **control** at high speeds.*  
  *I took the car to the garage and asked them to **have a look at** the steering.* (not *~~… to control the steering.~~*)

However, the noun *control* is used with the meaning of ‘inspection point’ in expressions like *passport/customs control*.
