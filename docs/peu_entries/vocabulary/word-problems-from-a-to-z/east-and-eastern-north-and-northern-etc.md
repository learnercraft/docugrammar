# east and eastern, north and northern, etc

## Adjectives: the difference

We often prefer *eastern*, *northern*, etc when we are talking about vague, indefinite or larger areas, and *east*, *north*, etc for more clearly defined places (e.g. the names of countries or states). Compare:

- *the **northern** part of the country*  
  *the **north** side of the house*
- *the **southern** counties of Britain*  
  *the **south** coast*
- ***southern** Africa (an area)*  
  ***South** Africa (a country)*
- *the **northern** United States*  
  ***North** Carolina*

However, place names do not always follow this rule. Note the following:

- ***Northern** Ireland*
- ***North/East/West** Africa*
- ***North/South** America*
- ***East/South**, etc Asia ``but`` **Western/Eastern**, etc Europe*
- ***South** Australia ``but`` **Western** Australia; the **Northern** Territory*
- *the **North/South** Atlantic/Pacific*
- *the **Northern/Southern** hemisphere*

## ‘belonging to’

We use *eastern*, *northern*, etc to mean ‘belonging to’ or ‘typical of’.

- *a **southern** accent*
- *a group of **northern** poets*

## Capital letters

Capital letters are used at the beginning of *East*, *Eastern*, *North*, *Northern*, etc when these come in official or well-established place names.

- ***North** Carolina*
- ***Western** Australia*

And capitals are used in *the West*, *the North*, etc when these are names of well-defined regions.

- *Unemployment is high in the **North**.*
- *My sister lives in the **South-west**.*

In other cases, adjectives, nouns and adverbs generally begin with small letters.

- *We spent the winter in **southern** California.*
- *I live in **north** London.*
- *The sun rises in the **east**.*
- *There’s a strong **north** wind.*
- *By sunrise we were driving **south**.*

## Prepositions

Note the difference between *in the east*, etc *of* … and *to the east*, etc *of* …

- *I live **in the east of** Scotland.*
- *Denmark is about 500km **to the east of** Scotland.*
