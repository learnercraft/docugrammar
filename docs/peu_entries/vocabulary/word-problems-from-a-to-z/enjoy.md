# enjoy

*Enjoy* normally has an object.

- *‘Did you **enjoy the party**?’ ‘Yes, I **enjoyed it** very much.’* (not *~~I enjoyed very much.~~*)

To talk about having a good time, we can use *enjoy myself*/*yourself*, etc.

- *I really **enjoyed myself** when I went to Rome.*
- *‘We’re going to Paris for the weekend.’ ‘**Enjoy yourselves**!’*

‘*Enjoy!*’ with no object is possible in informal English. It is often used by waiters in restaurants.

- *One chicken curry and one fillet of sole. **Enjoy!***

*Enjoy* can be followed by *\-ing*.

- *I don’t **enjoy looking** after small children.* (not *~~… enjoy to look …~~*)
