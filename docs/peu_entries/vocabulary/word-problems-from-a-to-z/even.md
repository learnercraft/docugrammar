# even

## Meaning

*Even* suggests the idea of a surprising extreme: ‘more than we expect’; *not even* suggests ‘less than we expect’.

- *She’s rude to everybody. She’s **even** rude to the police.*
- *He ca**n’t even** write his own name.*

## Position

*Even* most often goes with the verb, in mid-position [(see here)](./../../grammar/adverbs-and-adverbials/mid-position-details).

- *She has broken all her toys. She **has** **even broken** her bike.* (not *~~Even she has broken …~~*)
- *He speaks lots of languages. He **even** **speaks** Esperanto.*
- *They’re open every day. They’**re** **even** open on Christmas Day.*

*Even* goes at the beginning of a clause when it refers just to the subject; and it can go just before other words and expressions that we want to emphasise.

- *Anybody can do this. **Even** **a child** can do it.*
- *I work every day, **even** **on Sundays**.*
- *I haven’t seen my family for months – **not even** **my parents**.*

## *even* and *also*

*Also* [(see here)](./also-as-well-and-too) is not used to talk about surprising extremes.

- *Everybody helped with the packing – **even** the dog.* (not *~~… also the dog.~~*)

## *even if* and *even though*

*Even* is not used alone as a conjunction, but we can use *even* before *if* and *though*.

- ***Even though** I didn’t know anybody at the party, I had a nice time.* (not *~~Even although …~~*)

We sometimes use *if* to mean *even if*.

## *even so*; *even now*

*Even so* means ‘however’, ‘in spite of that’.

- *He seems nice. **Even so**, I don’t really trust him.* (not *~~… Even though, I don’t really trust him.~~*)

*Even now* can mean ‘in spite of everything that has happened’.
