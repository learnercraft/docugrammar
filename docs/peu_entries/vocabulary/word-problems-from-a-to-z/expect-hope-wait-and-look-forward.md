# expect, hope, wait and look forward

## *expect* and *hope*: difference of meaning

Expecting is a matter of thinking rather than feeling. If I *expect* something to happen, I have a good reason to think it will in fact happen. *Hoping* is more emotional. If I *hope* for something to happen, I would like it to happen, but I do not know whether it will. Compare:

- *I’**m expecting** Jack to phone at three o’clock.*  
  *I **hope** he’s got some good news.*
- *Lucy’**s expecting** a baby.* (= She’s pregnant.)  
  *She’**s hoping** it will be a girl.*

One can *expect* good or bad things, but one only *hopes* for things that one wants.

- *I **expect** it will rain at the weekend. But I **hope** it won’t.*

## *expect* and *wait*: difference of meaning

One *waits* when somebody or something is late, when one is early for something, or when one wants time to pass so that something will happen. *Waiting* is often physical – the word suggests, for example, standing or sitting somewhere until something happens.

Compare:

- *I’m **expecting** a phone call from Jack at three o’clock.*  
  *I hope he calls on time. I hate **waiting** for people to phone.* (not *~~I hate expecting people to phone.~~*)
- *He **expects** to get a bike for his birthday.* (= He thinks he’ll get one.)  
  *It’s hard to **wait** for things when you’re five years old.*
- *I **expected** her at ten, but she didn’t turn up.*  
  *I **waited** for her till eleven, and then went home.*

*Can’t wait* often expresses impatience.

- *I **can’t wait** for the weekend!*

When we say that we *expect* a person, this usually means that he/she is coming to our home, office, etc. Compare:

- *Come and see me this afternoon. I’ll **expect** you at 4.00.*
- *Let’s meet at the theatre. I’ll be there at 6.00.* (not *~~I’ll expect you at 6.00.~~*)

## *look forward*: meaning

*Look forward* means ‘think about (something in the future) with pleasure’. One *looks forward* to something that seems certain to happen, and that one is glad about.

- *He’s **looking forward** to his birthday.*
- *‘See you on Sunday.’ ‘I **look forward** to it.’*

## All four expressions compared

Compare:

- *I **expect** to hear from her.* (= I’m pretty sure I’ll get an email from her.)
- *I **hope** to hear from her.* (= I’m not sure whether she’ll write, but I would like her to.)
- *I’**m waiting** to hear from her.* (= I need her email to come; perhaps it’s late.)
- *I **look forward** to hearing from her.* (= I feel pleasure at the thought that I will hear from her.)

## Prepositions

Before an object, we use *expect* (with no preposition), *hope for*, *wait for*, and *look forward to*.

- *We’re expecting rain soon.*
- *We’re hoping **for** a lot of rain – the garden’s very dry.*
- *We’ve been waiting **for** rain for weeks.*
- *I’m looking forward **to** the autumn.*
- *I expect Jack to arrive about ten o’clock.* (not *~~I expect for him to arrive …~~*)
- *I’m hoping **for** him to come up with some new ideas.*
- *I’m still waiting **for** him to pay me back that money.*

After *look forward to*, we use the *\-ing* form of a verb [(see here)](./../../grammar/infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/ing-forms-after-prepositions-without-breaking-eggs#to-as-a-preposition-i-look-forward-to-ing).

- *I look forward to **talking** to him.* (not *~~… to talk to him.~~*)
- *I look forward to **hearing** from you.* (in an email / a letter)

## Simple and progressive forms

Before an infinitive, simple and progressive forms of *hope*, *expect* and *look forward to* can often be used with little difference of meaning.

- *We **hope** / We’**re hoping** to get to Scotland next weekend.*
- *We **expect** / We’**re expecting** to hear from Lucy today.*
- *I **look forward** / I’**m looking forward** to the day when the children leave home.*

## *that*-clauses

*Expect* and *hope* can be used before a *that*\-clause.

- *I **expect (that)** she’ll be here soon.*
- *I **hope (that)** I’ll recognise her.*
- *but not *~~I’m waiting that she arrives.~~**

Progressive forms of *expect* are not normally used before *that*\-clauses.

- *I expect that we’ll have a lot to talk about.* (not *~~I’m expecting that we’ll …~~*)

*Hope (that)* is often followed by a present tense with a future meaning [(see here)](./hope).

- *I hope (that) she **doesn’t** miss the train.*

## *expect*: other points

*Expect* is often used with object + infinitive to talk about people’s duties.

- *We **expect you to work** on the first Saturday of every month.*

 Passive versions of the structure are also common.

- *Staff **are expected to start** work punctually at 8.30.*

*I expect (that)* can be used to talk about the present or past, with the meaning ‘I suppose’, ‘I have good reason to think’.

- ***I expect** you’re all tired after your journey.*
- *Sarah isn’t here. **I expect** she was too tired to come.*

We can say that we *expect something of somebody*, to express our feelings about how somebody ought to behave.

- *My parents **expected too much of me** when I was at school. They were terribly upset when I failed my exams.*
