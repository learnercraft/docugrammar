# feel

*Feel* has several different meanings. Progressive forms can be used with some meanings, but not with others. *Feel* can be a linking verb [(see here)](./../../grammar/verbs/linking-verbs-be-seem-look-etc), followed by an adjective or noun complement. It can also be an ordinary verb, followed by a direct object.

## Linking verb: *I feel fine*

*Feel* can be used to talk about one’s physical or mental sensations. Adjective or (in British English) noun complements are used.

- *I **feel** fine.*
- *Do you **feel** happy?*
- *Andrew was beginning to **feel** cold.*
- *When Louise realised what she had done, she **felt** a complete idiot.* (BrE)

In this sense *feel* is not normally used with reflexive pronouns (*myself*, etc).

- *He always **felt** inferior when he was with her.(More natural than *He always felt himself inferior …*)*

To talk about feelings that are going on at a particular moment, simple or progressive forms can be used. There is little difference of meaning.

- *I **feel** fine. / I’**m feeling** fine.*
- *How **do** you **feel**? / How **are** you **feeling**?*

## Linking verb: *That feels nice!*

*Feel* can also be used to say that something causes sensations. Progressive forms are not used.

- ***That feels** nice!*
- ***The glass felt** cold against my lips.*

## Linking verb: *feel like*; *feel as if*/*though*

*Feel* can be followed by *like* or *as if*/*though*.

- *My legs **feel like** cotton wool.*
- *Alice **felt as if**/**though** she was in a very nice dream.* (*Alice felt like she was …* is also possible, [(see here)](./as-if-and-as-though-like).)

## *feel like* meaning ‘want’

*Feel like* can also mean ‘want’, ‘would like’.

- *I **feel like** a drink. Have you got any beer?*

In this sense, *feel like* is often followed by an *\-ing* form.

- *I **felt like laughing**, but I didn’t dare.*

Compare:

- *I **felt like** swimming.* (= I wanted to swim.)
- *I felt **like** / **as if** I was swimming.* (= It seemed as if I was swimming.)

## Reactions and opinions

*Feel* is often used to talk about reactions and opinions. Progressive forms are not usually used in this case.

- *I **feel sure** you’re right.* (not *~~I’m feeling sure …~~*)
- *He says he **feels doubtful** about the new plan.*

*That*\-clauses are common.

- *I **feel (that)** she’s making a mistake.*

A structure with object + *to be* + complement is possible in a formal style, but it is not very often used.

- *I **felt her to be unfriendly**.* (More normal: *I *felt that she was unfriendly**.)

There is also a structure *feel it* (+ *to be*) + adjective/noun.

- *We **felt it necessary** to call the police.*
- *I **felt it (to be) my duty** to call the police.*

## ‘receive physical sensations’

*Feel* can be used with a direct object to talk about the physical sensations that come to us through the sense of touch.

- *I suddenly **felt an insect** crawling up my leg.*

Progressive forms are not used, but we often use *can feel* to talk about a sensation that is going on at a particular moment.

- *I **can feel** something biting me!*

## ‘touch’

*Feel* can also be used with a direct object to mean ‘touch something to learn about it or experience it’. Progressive forms are possible.

- ***Feel the photocopier**. It’s very hot.*
- *‘What are you doing?’ ‘I’**m feeling the shirts** to see if they’re dry.’*
