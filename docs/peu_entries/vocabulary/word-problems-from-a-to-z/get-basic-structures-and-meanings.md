# get: basic structures and meanings

*Get* is one of the commonest words in English, and is used in many different ways. It is sometimes avoided in a very formal style, but it is correct and natural in most kinds of speech and writing. The meaning of *get* depends on what kind of word comes after it. With a direct object, the basic meaning is ‘obtain’, ‘come to have’; with other kinds of word, the basic meaning is ‘become’, ‘come to be’.

## *get* + noun/pronoun: *I got an email*

With a direct object (noun or pronoun), *get* usually means ‘receive’, ‘fetch’, ‘obtain’, ‘catch’ or something similar. The exact meaning depends on the object.

- *I **got an email** from Lucy this morning.*
- *Can you come and **get me** from the station when I arrive?*
- *If I listen to loud music I **get a headache**.*
- *If you **get a number 6 bus**, it stops right outside our house.*

*Get* can be used with two objects [(see here)](./../../grammar/verbs/verbs-with-two-objects).

- *Let me **get you a drink**.*

Other meanings are sometimes possible.

- *I didn’t **get** the joke.* (= understand)
- *I’ll **get** you for this, you bastard.* (= punish, make suffer)

*Get* + noun is not normally used to mean ‘become’. To express this meaning, we can use *get to be* + noun [(see here)](./get-basic-structures-and-meanings#get-ing-get-infinitive) below).

- *Wayne’s **getting to be** a lovely kid.* (not *~~Wayne’s getting a lovely kid.~~*)

## *get* + adjective: *getting old*

Before an adjective, *get* usually means ‘become’.

- *As you **get old**, your memory **gets** **worse**.*
- *My feet are **getting cold**.*

With object + adjective, the meaning is ‘make somebody/something become’.

- *It’s time to **get the kids ready** for school.*
- *I can’t **get my hands warm**.*
- *We must **get the house clean** before your mother arrives.*

## *get* + adverb particle or preposition: *get out*

Before an adverb particle (like *up*, *away*, *out*) or a preposition, *get* nearly always refers to a movement of some kind. (For the difference between *get* and *go*, [(see here)](./get-and-go-movement).)

- *I often **get up** at five o’clock.*
- *I went to see him, but he told me to **get out**.*
- *Would you mind **getting off** my foot?*

In some idioms the meaning is different – e.g. *get to a place (= arrive at …)*; *get over something (= recover from)*; *get on with somebody (= have a good relationship with).*

With an object, the structure usually means ‘make somebody/something move’.

- *You can’t **get him out of** bed in the morning.*
- *Would you mind **getting your papers off** my desk?*
- *Have you ever tried to **get toothpaste back** into the tube?*
- *The car’s OK – it **gets me** **from** A to B.*

## *get* + past participle: *get washed*, *dressed*, *married*, etc

*Get* can be used with a past participle. This structure often has a reflexive meaning, to talk about things that we ‘do to ourselves’. Common expressions are *get washed*, *get dressed*, *get lost*, *get drowned*, *get engaged/married/divorced*.

- *You’ve got five minutes to **get dressed**.*
- *She’**s getting married** in June.*

## *get* *…ing*; *get* + infinitive

*Get …ing* is sometimes used informally to mean ‘start …ing’, especially in the expressions *get moving*, *get going*.

- *We’d better **get moving** – it’s late.*

With an infinitive, *get* can mean ‘manage’, ‘have an opportunity’ or ‘be allowed’.

- *We didn’t **get to see her** – she was too busy.*

*Get* + infinitive can also suggest gradual development.

- *You’ll **get to speak** English more easily as time goes by.*

## *got* and *gotten*

In British English the past participle of *get* is *got*. In American English the past participle is **gotten** (e.g. *You’ve **gotten** us in a lot of trouble*) except in the structure *have got* [(see here)](./../../grammar/be-have-and-do/have-got-possession-relationships-and-other-states).
