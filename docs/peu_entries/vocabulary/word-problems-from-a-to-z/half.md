# half

## *half (of)*

We use *half* or *half of* mostly before a noun with a determiner (article, possessive or demonstrative). We do not normally put *a* or *the* before *half* in this case.

- *She spends **half (of) her time** travelling.* (not *~~She spends a/the half …~~*)
- *I gave him **half (of) a cheese pie** to keep him quiet.*

When *half (of)* is followed by a plural noun, the verb is plural.

- *Half (of) my **friends live** abroad.* (not *~~Half of my friends lives …~~*)

*Of* is not used in expressions of measurement and quantity.

- *I live **half a mile** from here.* (not *~~… half of a mile …~~*)
- *I just need **half a loaf** of bread.* (not *~~… half of a loaf …~~*)
- *The train was **half an hour** late.* (AmE also *… a half hour …*)

We use *half of* before pronouns.

- *‘Did you like the books?’ ‘I’ve only read **half of them**.’*

## No following noun

*Half* can be used without a following noun, if the meaning is clear.

- *I’ve bought some chocolate. You can have **half**.* (not *~~… the half.~~*)

## *the half*

We use *the* before *half* if we are saying which half we mean. Before a noun, *of* is used in this case.

- *Would you like **the big half** or **the small half**?*
- *I didn’t like **the second half of** the film.*

## *half a* and *a half*

*Half* usually comes before the article *a/an*, but it is possible to put it after in expressions of measurement.

- *Could I have **half a pound** of grapes?* (or … **a half pound** …)

## *one and a half*

The expression *one and a half* goes with a plural noun. Compare:

- *I’ve been waiting for **one and a half hours**.* (not *~~… one and a half hour.~~*)
- *I’ve been waiting for **an hour and a half**.*
