# hear and listen (to)

## *hear*: meaning

*Hear* is the ordinary word to say that something ‘comes to our ears’.

- *Suddenly I **heard** a strange noise.* (not *~~Suddenly I listened to a strange noise.~~*)
- *Can you **hear** me?*

## *listen (to)*: meaning

*Listen (to)* is used to talk about paying attention to sounds that are going on, in progress. It emphasises the idea of concentrating, trying to hear as well as possible. You can hear something without wanting to, but you can only listen to something deliberately. Compare:

- *I **heard** them talking upstairs, but I didn’t really **listen** to their conversation.*
- *‘**Listen** carefully, please.’ ‘Could you speak louder? I can’t **hear** you very well.’*
- *I didn’t **hear** the phone because I was **listening to** the radio.*

## Complete experiences: *hear*

*Listen (to)* is mostly used to talk about concentrating on experiences that are going on, in progress. To talk about the result of listening: experiencing or understanding the whole of a performance, speech, piece of music, broadcast or other communication, we generally use *hear*. Compare:

- *When she arrived, I was **listening to** a recording of Brendel playing Beethoven.* (not *~~… I was hearing …~~*)  
  *I once **heard** Brendel play all the Beethoven concertos.* (not *~~I once listened to Brendel play …~~*)
- *I wish I had more time to **listen to** the radio.* (not *~~… to hear the radio.~~*)  
  *Did you **hear / listen to** the news yesterday?*

## *hear* not used in progressive forms

*Hear* is not usually used in progressive forms. To say that one hears something at the moment of speaking, *can hear* is often used, especially in British English [(see here)](./../../grammar/modal-auxiliary-verbs/can-and-could-with-see-hear-etc).

- *I **can hear** somebody coming.* (not *~~I am hearing …~~*)

## *listen* and *listen to*

When there is no object, *listen* is used without *to*. Compare:

- ***Listen**!* (not *~~Listen to!~~*)
- ***Listen to** me!* (not *~~Listen me!~~*)

:::note

There are similar differences between *see*, *look (at)* and *watch*. [(see here)](./see-look-at-and-watch)

For *hear* + object + infinitive/*\-ing*, [(see here)](./../../grammar/infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/hear-see-etc-object-verb-form).
