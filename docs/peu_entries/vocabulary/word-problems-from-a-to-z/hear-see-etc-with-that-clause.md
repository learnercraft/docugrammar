# hear, see, etc with that-clause

The present-tense forms *I hear (that) …* and *I see (that) …* are often used to introduce pieces of news which one has heard or seen.

- ***I hear (that)** Alice is expecting a baby.*
- ***I see (that)** the firemen are going on strike.*

 Some other verbs can be used like this. Common examples are *understand* and *gather*. These are often used to check information.

- *‘**I understand** you’re moving to a new job.’ ‘Yes, that’s right.’*
- *‘**I gather** you didn’t like the party.’  ‘What makes you say that?’*
