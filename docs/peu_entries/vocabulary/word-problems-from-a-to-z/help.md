# help

After *help*, we can use object + infinitive (with or without *to*).

- *Can you **help me (to) find** my ring?* (not *~~Can you help me finding my ring?~~*)
- *Thank you so much for **helping us (to) repair** the car.*
- *Our main task is to **help the company (to) become** profitable.*

*Help* can also be followed directly by an infinitive without an object.

- *Would you like to **help pack**?*

:::note

For the expression *can’t help …ing*, [(see here)](./can-t-help).
