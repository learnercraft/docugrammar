# here and there

We use *here* for the place where the speaker/writer is, and *there* for other places.

- *(on the telephone) ‘Hello, is Tom **there**?’ ‘No, I’m sorry, he’s not **here.’*** (not *~~… he’s not **there**.~~*)
- *Don’t stay **there** in the corner by yourself. Come over **here** and talk to us.*

Note that *here* and *there* cannot normally be used as nouns.

- *This place is terrible.*
- *It is terrible here.* (but not *~~Here is terrible.~~*)
- *Did you like that place? Did you like it there?* (but not *~~Did you like there?~~*)

:::note

There are similar differences between *this* and *that* [(see here)](./../../grammar/determiners-a-an-and-the-my-your-etc-this-that-etc/this-and-that), *come* and *go* [(see here)](./come-and-go) and *bring* and *take* [(see here)](./bring-and-take).
