# high and tall

## What kind of things are *tall*?

We use *tall* mostly for people, trees, buildings with many floors, and a few other things which are higher than they are wide (e.g. factory chimneys or electricity pylons).

- *How **tall** are you?* (not *~~How high are you?~~*)
- *There are some beautiful **tall** trees at the end of our garden.*

In other cases we usually prefer *high*.

- *Mount Elbrus is the **highest** mountain in Europe.*
- *The garden’s got very **high** walls.*

## Measurements

In measurements, we use *tall* for people, but we prefer *high* for things. Compare:

- *I’m 1m 93 **tall**.*
- *That tree is about 30m **high**.*

## Distance above the ground

We use *high* to talk about distance above the ground. A child standing on a chair may be *higher* than her mother, although she is probably not *taller*.

- *That shelf is too **high** for me to reach.*
- *The clouds are very **high** today.*

## Parts of the body

Parts of the body can be *long*, but not *tall*.

- *Alex has got beautiful **long** legs.* (not *~~… **tall** legs.~~*)
