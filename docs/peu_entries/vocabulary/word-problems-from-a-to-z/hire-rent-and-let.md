# hire, rent and let

## *hire* and *rent*

*Hire* and *rent* can mean: ‘pay for the use of something’. In British English, *rent* is used for arrangements involving a long period of time (one rents a house or a flat). For shorter periods (e.g. paying for a car, a boat, evening dress) *rent* and *hire* can both be used.

- *How much does it cost to **rent** a two-room flat?*
- *I need to **hire/rent** a car for the weekend.*

*Hire (out)* and *rent (out)* can also mean ‘sell the use of something’.

- *There’s a shop in High Street that **hires/rents (out)** evening dress.*

In American English, *rent* is the normal word for both longer and shorter arrangements; *hire*, in American English, normally means ‘employ’.

## *let*

*Let* is used in British English, like *rent (out)*, to talk about selling the use of rooms, houses, etc.

- *We **let** the upstairs room to a student.*
