## Articles and prepositions

No article is used in the expression *at home* (meaning ‘in one’s own place’).

- *Is anybody **at home**?* (not *~~… at the home?~~*)

*At* is often dropped, especially in American English.

- *Is anybody **home**?*

*Home* (without *to*) can be used as an adverb referring to direction.

- *I think I’ll go **home**.* (not *~~… to home.~~*)

There is no special preposition in English to express the idea of being at somebody’s home (like French *chez*, German *bei*, Danish/Swedish/Norwegian *hos*, etc). One way of saying this is to use *at* with a possessive.

- *We had a great evening **at Philip’s**.*
- *Ring up and see if Jacqueline is **at the Smiths’**, could you?*

## *house* and *home*

*House* is an emotionally neutral word: it just refers to a particular type of building. *Home* is used more personally: it is the place that somebody lives in, and can express the idea of emotional attachment to a place. Compare:

- *There are some horrible new **houses** in our village.*
- *I lived there for six years, but I never really felt it was my **home**.*
