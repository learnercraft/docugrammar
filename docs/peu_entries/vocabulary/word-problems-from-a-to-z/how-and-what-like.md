# how and what … like?

## Changes: *How’s Ron?*

We generally use *how* to ask about things that change – for example people’s moods and health. We prefer *what … like* to ask about things that do not change – for example people’s character and appearance. Compare:

- *‘**How’**s Ron?’ ‘He’s very well.’*  
  *‘**What’**s Ron **like**?’ ‘He’s quiet and a bit shy.’*
- *‘**How** does she look today?’ ‘Tired.’*  
  *‘**What** does she look **like**?’ ‘Short and dark, pretty, cheerful-looking.’*

## Reactions: *How was the film?*

We often use *how* to ask about people’s reactions to their experiences. *What … like* is also possible.

- *‘**How** was the film?’ ‘Very good.’* (or **What** was the film **like …?**)
- ***How’**s your steak?*
- ***How’**s the new job?*
