# in spite of

*In spite of* is used as a preposition. *In spite of* + noun means more or less the same as *although* + clause.

- *We went out **in spite of** the rain.* (= … although it was raining.)
- *We understood him **in spite of** his accent.* (= … although he had a strong accent.)

*In spite of* is the opposite of *because of*. Compare:

- *She passed her exams **in spite of** her terrible teacher.*
- *She passed her exams **because of** her wonderful teacher.*

*In spite of* can be followed by an *\-ing* form.

- ***In spite of having** a headache I enjoyed the film.*

*In spite of* cannot be followed directly by a *that*\-clause. Instead, we can use *in spite of the fact that*.

- *He is good company, **in spite of the fact that** he talks all the time.*

This is rather heavy: *although* means the same, and is more common.

In more formal English, *despite* can be used in the same way as *in spite of*.
