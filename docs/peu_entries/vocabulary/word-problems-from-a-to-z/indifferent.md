# indifferent

*Indifferent* is not the opposite of *different*. It is used to say that one has no interest in something that other people might be concerned about.

- *He’s quite **indifferent** to people’s opinion of his work.*
- *You can’t be **indifferent** to climate change.*

Another meaning is ‘not very good’.

- *The team’s performance has been **indifferent** all year.*
