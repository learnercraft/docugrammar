# later and in

With a time expression, we generally use *later* to mean ‘after that time’, and *in* to mean ‘after now’. Compare:

- *She got married on her 18th birthday; **six months later** she was divorced.*
- *Penny’s coming on July 1st, and Tom will arrive about **a week later**.*
- *I’ll see you **in a few days**.* (not *~~I’ll see you a few days later.~~*)

But without a time expression, *later* can be used to mean ‘after now’.

- *Bye! See you **later**!*
