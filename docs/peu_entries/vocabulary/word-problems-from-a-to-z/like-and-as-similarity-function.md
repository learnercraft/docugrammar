# like and as: similarity, function

We can use *like* or *as* to say that things are similar.

We can also use *as* to talk about function – the jobs that people or things do.

## *like* (similarity): *like me*

*Like* can be a preposition. We use *like*, not *as*, before a noun or pronoun to talk about similarity.

:::tip[Grammar]

*like* + noun/pronoun

:::

- *My sister looks **like me**.* (not *~~… as me.~~*)
- *He ran **like the wind**.* (not *~~… as the wind.~~*)
- ***Like his parents**, he is a vegetarian.*

We can use *very*, *quite* and other adverbs of degree before *like*.

- *He’s **very like** his father.*
- *She looks **a bit like** Queen Victoria.*

We can use *like* to give examples.

- *She’s good at scientific subjects, **like mathematics**.* (not *~~… as mathematics.~~*)
- *In mountainous countries, **like Peru**, …*

## *as* (similarity): *as I do*

*As* is a conjunction. We use it before a clause, and before an expression beginning with a preposition.

*as* + clause

:::tip[Grammar]

*as* + preposition phrase

:::

- *Nobody knows her **as I do**.*
- *We often drink tea with the meal, **as they do** in China.*
- *In 1939, **as in 1914**, everybody seemed to want war.*
- *On Friday, **as on Tuesday**, the meeting will be at 8.30.*

## *like I do* (informal)

In modern English, *like* is often used as a conjunction instead of *as*. This is most common in an informal style.

- *Nobody loves you **like I do**.*

## Inverted word order: *as did all his family*

In a very formal style, *as* is sometimes followed by auxiliary verb + subject (note the inverted word order, [(see here)](./../../grammar/information-structure/inversion-auxiliary-verb-before-subject).

- *She was a Catholic, **as were** most of her friends.*
- *He believed, **as did** all his family, that the king was their supreme lord.*

## *as you know*, etc

Some expressions beginning with *as* are used to introduce facts which are ‘common ground’ – known to both speaker/writer and listener/reader. Examples are *as you know*, *as we agreed*, *as you suggested*.

- ***As you know**, next Tuesday’s meeting has been cancelled.*
- *I am sending you the bill for the repairs, **as we agreed**.*

There are some passive expressions of this kind – for example *as is well known*; *as was agreed*. Note that there is no subject *it* after *as* in these expressions [(see here)](./../../grammar/other-adverbial-clauses/than-and-as-clauses-leaving-out-subjects-etc).

- ***As is well known**, more people get colds in wet weather.* (not *~~As it is well known …~~*)
- *I am sending you the bill, **as was agreed**.* (not *~~… as it was agreed.~~*)

## Comparison with *as* and *like* after negatives

After a negative clause, a comparison with *as* or *like* usually refers only to the positive part of what comes before.

- *I don’t **smoke**, **like Megan**.* (Megan smokes.)
- *I am not **a Conservative**, **like Joe**.* (Joe is a Conservative.)

Before a negative clause, the comparison refers to the whole clause.

- ***Like Emily**, I **don’t smoke**.* (Emily doesn’t smoke.)
- ***Like James**, I **am not a Conservative**.* (James is not a Conservative.)

## Function or role: *He worked as a waiter.*

Another use of *as* is to say what function or role a person or thing has – what jobs people do, what purposes things are used for, what category they belong to, etc. In this case, *as* is a preposition, used before a noun.

- *He worked **as a waiter** for two years.* (not *~~… like a waiter.~~*)
- *Please don’t use that knife **as a screwdriver**.*
- *A crocodile starts life **as an egg**.*

Compare this use of *as* with *like*.

- ***As your brother**, I must warn you to be careful.* (I am your brother.)
- ***Like your brother**, I must warn you to be careful.* (I am not your brother, but he and I have similar attitudes.)
