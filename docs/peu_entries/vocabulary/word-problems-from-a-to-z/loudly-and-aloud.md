# loudly and aloud

*Loudly* is used (like *loud*) to talk about the strength of a noise. The opposite is *quietly*.

- *They were talking **so loudly** I couldn’t hear myself think.*

*Aloud* is often used with the words *read* and *think*, to say that words are spoken, and not just ‘said’ silently in the head.

- *She has a very good pronunciation when she **reads aloud**.*
- *‘What did you say?’ ‘Oh, nothing. I was just **thinking aloud**.’*
