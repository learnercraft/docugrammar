# make: prepositions

We usually say that something is *made of* a particular material.

- *Most things seem to be **made of** plastic these days.*
- *All our furniture is **made of** wood.*

When a material is changed into a completely different form to make something, we often use *make from*.

- *Paper is **made from** wood.* (not *~~Paper is made of wood.~~*)

When we talk about the process of manufacture, we can also use *out of*.

- *He **made** all the window-frames **out of** oak; it took a long time.*

To mention one of several materials (e.g. in cooking), we can use *make with*.

- *‘The soup’s good.’ ‘Yes, I **make** it **with** lots of garlic.’*
