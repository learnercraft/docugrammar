# maybe and perhaps

These two words mean the same. They are both common. In British English, *perhaps* is used more often than *maybe* in a formal style, and in this case it may go in mid-position [(see here)](./../../grammar/adverbs-and-adverbials/mid-position-details).

- ***Maybe/Perhaps** it’ll stop raining soon.*
- *Julius Caesar is **perhaps** the greatest of Shakespeare’s early plays.*

*Perhaps* is often pronounced ‘praps’ by British people.
