# mind: do you mind, etc

## Meaning and use

*Mind* can mean ‘dislike’, ‘be annoyed by’, ‘object to’. We use *mind* mostly in questions and negative clauses.

- *‘**Do you mind** the smell of tobacco?’ ‘Not at all.’*
- ***Do you mind** if we leave a bit earlier today?*
- ***I don’t mind** if you use my car.*

After *mind*, we can use an *\-ing* form, or object + *\-ing* form.

- *Do you **mind waiting** a few minutes?* (not *~~… to wait …~~*)
- *I don’t **mind you coming** in late if you don’t wake me up.*

## *Would you mind …*?

We can use *Would you mind …?* to ask people to do things, or to ask for permission.

- ***Would you mind** opening the window?* (= Please open …)
- ***Would you mind** if I opened the window?*

## *Do/Would you mind my …ing?*

In a slightly more formal style, we can use *my*, *your*, etc with an *\-ing* form after *mind* ( [(see here)](./../../grammar/infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles/ing-form-as-subject-object-or-complement#the-opening-of-parliament-my-smoking).

- *Do you mind **my** smoking?* (More informal: … *me smoking?* … if I smoke?)

## Answers

After *Would/Do you mind …*?, we use *No* or *Not at all* (more formal) to give permission (but we often add more words to make the meaning quite clear).

- *‘Do you mind if I look at your paper?’ ‘**No**, **please do / that’s OK / sure**.’*

## Tenses

In subordinate clauses after *mind*, a present tense is usually used if we want to express a future meaning [(see here)](./../../grammar/conjunctions-sentences-and-clauses/tense-simplification-in-subordinate-clauses).

- *I don’t mind what the children **do** after they leave home.* (not *~~I don’t mind what the children will do …~~*)
