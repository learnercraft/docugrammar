# name

A person’s *name* is the whole expression that identifies them – for example *Andy Barlow*, *William Shakespeare*, *Carol Jane Griffiths*, *Naseem Khan*, *Li Wei*. The word *name* does not mean just one or other part of this – though of course only one part may be used, depending on the situation.

- *‘**Name**, please?’ ‘Alan Bennett.’*
- *‘Hi. Come in. What’s your **name**.’ ‘Jenny.’*
- *My **name’**s Smith. I have an appointment with Mr Andrews.*

The *surname*, *family name* or *last name* is the part which, in many cultures, is typically passed from parents to children – for example *Barlow*, *Shakespeare*. *First names*, *Christian names* or *given names* (AmE) are the parts which children are given at birth – for example *Jessica*, *George Thomas*, *Alice Catherine*. (The expression *Christian name* is generally avoided in multi-cultural contexts.) Americans often use two given names, or one and an initial (e.g. *Philip C. Walter*, *F. Scott Fitzgerald*. The second of these is generally called the ‘middle name’. British people use middle names less often.

Note that the terms *first name* and *last name* can sometimes cause confusion, since in some cultures it is common to give the family name first.
