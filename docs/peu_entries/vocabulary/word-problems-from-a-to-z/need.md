# need

## Ordinary verb: *Everybody needs to rest.*

*Need* most often has ordinary verb forms: the third person singular has *\-s*, and questions and negatives are made with *do*. *Need* is usually followed by an infinitive with *to*.

- *Everybody **needs to rest** sometimes.*
- *Do we **need to reserve** seats on the train?*

## Modal auxiliary forms: *he needn’t*; *need I?*

*Need* can also have the same present-tense forms as modal auxiliary verbs: the third person singular has no *\-s*, and questions and negatives are made without *do*. In this case, *need* is normally followed by an infinitive without *to*.

- *She **needn’t reserve** a seat – there’ll be plenty of room.*

These forms are used mainly in negative sentences (*needn’t*); but they are also possible in questions, after *if*, and in other ‘non-affirmative’ structures [(see here)](./../../grammar/basic-clause-types/non-affirmative-words-anybody-ever-yet-etc).

- *You **needn’t fill** in a form.*
- *I wonder **if** I **need fill** in a form.*
- *but not *~~You need fill in a form.~~**
- ***Need** I **fill** in a form?*
- *This is the only form you **need fill** in.*

These forms are more common in British English; in American English *have to* / *don’t have to* are preferred.

## *needn’t*, *need I?*: immediate necessity

These modal forms of *need* normally refer to immediate necessity. They are often used to ask for or give permission – usually permission not to do something. They are not used to talk about habitual, general necessity. Compare:

- *It’s OK – you **needn’t** / **don’t need to pay** for that phone call.*
- *You **don’t need to pay** for emergency calls in most countries.* (not *~~You needn’t pay … in most countries.~~*)

## Talking about the future

Present tense forms of *need* are used when making decisions about the future.

- ***Need** I **come** in tomorrow?*
- *Tell her she **doesn’t need to work** tonight.*

*Will need to …* can be used to talk about future obligation, and give advice for the future. It can make orders and instructions sound less direct.

- *We’**ll need to repair** the roof next year.*
- *You’**ll need to start** work soon if you want to pass your exams.*
- *You’**ll need to fill** in this form before you see the Inspector.*

## *need …ing*: *The sofa needs cleaning.*

After *need* an *\-ing* form can be used with the same meaning as a passive infinitive, especially in British English.

- *That sofa **needs cleaning** again.* (= … needs to be cleaned …)

A structure with object + *…ing* or past participle is also possible in some cases.

- *You **need your head examining**.* (BrE) (or … examined.)

## *need not have …*

If we say that somebody *need not have done something*, we mean that he or she did it, but that it was unnecessary – a waste of time.

- *You **needn’t have woken** me up. I don’t have to go to work today.*
- *I **needn’t have cooked** so much food. Nobody was hungry.*

On the other hand, if we say that somebody *did not need to do something*, we are simply saying that it was not necessary (whether or not it was done). Compare:

- *I **needn’t have watered** the flowers. Just after I finished it started raining.*
- *It started raining, so I **didn’t need to water** the flowers.*

*Need never have …* is a more emphatic version of *need not have …*

- *I **need never have** packed all that suncream – it rained every day.*

## *need not* and *must not*

*Need not* or *do not need to* is used to say that there is no obligation; *must not* is used to say that there is an obligation not to do something. Compare:

- *You **needn’t** tell Jennifer – she already knows.*
- *You **mustn’t** tell Charlotte – I don’t want her to know.*

*Need not* is also sometimes used to say that something is not necessarily true.

- *‘She looks quite ill. I’m sure it’s flu.’ ‘It **needn’t** be – maybe she’s just over-tired.’*
