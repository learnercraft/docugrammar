# not and no

To make a word, expression or clause negative, we use *not*.

- ***Not surprisingly**, we missed the train.* (not *~~No surprisingly …~~*)
- *The students went on strike, but **not the teachers**.* (not *~~… but no the teachers.~~*)
- *I can see you tomorrow, but **not on Thursday**.*
- *I **have not received** his answer.*

We can use *no* with a noun or *\-ing* form to mean ‘not any’, or ‘not a/an’.

- ***No teachers** went on strike.* (= There weren’t any teachers on strike.)
- *I’ve got **no Thursdays** free this term.* (= I haven’t got any Thursdays …)
- *I telephoned, but there was **no answer**.* (= There wasn’t an answer.)
- **``NO SMOKING``**

Sometimes sentences constructed with verb + *not* and *no* + noun have similar meanings. The structure with *no* is usually more emphatic.

- *There **wasn’t** an answer. / There was **no answer**.*
