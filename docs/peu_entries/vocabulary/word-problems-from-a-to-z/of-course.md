# of course

We use *of course (not)* to mean ‘as everybody knows’ or ‘as is obvious’.

- *It looks as if the sun goes around the earth, but **of course** that’s not true.*
- *We’ll leave at eight o’clock. Granny won’t be coming, **of course**.*

*Of course* can be used as a polite reply to a request.

- *‘Could you help me?’ ‘**Of course**.’*

But *of course* is not always a very polite reply to a statement of fact.

- *‘It’s cold.’ ‘It certainly is.’* (not *~~Of course it is.~~* – this would suggest that the first speaker had said something too obvious to be worth mentioning.)

:::note

For the use of *of course* to structure arguments, [(see here)](./../../grammar/written-texts/discourse-markers-in-writing#focusing), [(see here)](./../../grammar/speech-and-spoken-exchanges/discourse-markers-in-speech#subdividing).
