# often

*Often* is mostly used for habitual behaviour, to mean ‘a lot of times on different occasions’. To say ‘a lot of times on one occasion’, we normally use another expression (e.g. *a lot of times*, *several times*, *keep …ing*). Compare:

- *I **often** fell in love when I was younger.*
- *I fell **several times** yesterday when I was skiing. or I **kept falling** yesterday …* (not *~~I often fell yesterday …~~*)

Note that *often* has two common pronunciations, with and without *t*: /ˈɒfən/

and /ˈɒftən/

.
