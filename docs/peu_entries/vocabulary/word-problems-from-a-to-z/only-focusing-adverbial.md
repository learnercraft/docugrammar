# only: focusing adverbial

*Only* can be used as a focusing adverbial [(see here)](./../../grammar/adverbs-and-adverbials/focusing-adverbials). It can refer to different parts of a sentence.

## Referring to the subject

*Only* normally comes before a subject that it refers to.

- ***Only you** could do a thing like that.*
- ***Only my mother** really understands me.*

## Referring to other parts of a sentence

When *only* refers to another part of a sentence, it often goes in ‘mid-position’ with the verb [(see here)](./../../grammar/adverbs-and-adverbials/mid-position-details) for details).

- *She **only reads** biographies.*
- *I **only like** swimming in the sea.*
- *She **is only** on duty on Tuesdays.*
- *I’**ve only been** to India once.*
- *She **was only** talking like that because she was nervous.*

## Ambiguous sentences

Sometimes sentences with *only* are ambiguous (they can be understood in more than one way).

- *I **only** kissed your sister last night.* (The sense can be ‘only kissed’, ‘only your sister’ or ‘only last night’.)

In speech, the meaning is usually clear because the speaker stresses the part of the sentence that *only* refers to. Even in writing, the context generally stops sentences like these from being really ambiguous. However, if necessary *only* can be put directly before the object, complement or adverbial expression that it refers to. This is generally rather formal. Compare:

- *They **only** play poker on Saturday nights.* (could be ambiguous)
- *They play **only poker** on Saturday nights.*
- *They play poker **only on Saturday nights**.*

The meaning can also be made more precise with a relative structure.

- *Poker is **the only game** (that) they play on Saturday nights.*
- *Saturday nights are **the only time (that) they play poker**.*

## *only today*, etc

*Only* with a time expression can mean ‘as recently as’ or ‘not before’.

- *I saw her **only today** – she looks much better.*
- ***Only then** did she realise what she had agreed to.*
- *My shoes will **only** be ready **on Friday**.*

:::note

For inverted word order after *only*, as in the last example but one, [(see here)](./../../grammar/information-structure/inversion-auxiliary-verb-before-subject#after-negative-and-restrictive-expressions-at-no-time-was-he-).

*Only* can also be a determiner in a noun phrase (e.g. *You are my only real friend*).
