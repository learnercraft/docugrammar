# opposite (adjective): position

We put the adjective *opposite* before a noun when we are talking about one of a pair of things that naturally face or contrast with each other.

- *I think the picture would look better on the **opposite wall**.*
- *She went off in the **opposite direction**.*
- *I’ve got exactly the **opposite opinion** to yours.*
- *His brother was fighting on the **opposite side**.*

We put *opposite* after the noun when it means ‘facing the speaker or listener’ or ‘facing a person or place that has already been mentioned’.

- *I noticed that the **man opposite** was staring at me.* (not *~~… the opposite man was staring at me.~~*)
- *The woman she was looking for was in the **house** directly **opposite**.*

:::note

For *opposite* and *contrary*, [(see here)](./contrary).
