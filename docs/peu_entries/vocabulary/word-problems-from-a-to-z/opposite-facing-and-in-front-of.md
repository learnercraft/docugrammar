# opposite, facing and in front of

## ‘across a road/room, etc from’: *opposite*/*facing*

We do not use *in front of* to mean ‘across a road/river/room, etc from’. This idea is usually expressed with *opposite* or *facing* (AmE also *across from*).

- *There’s a garage **opposite** my house.* (not *~~… in front of my house.~~*)
- *She stood at the other side of the table **facing** me.* (not *~~… in front of me.~~*)
- *The man sitting **across from** me was smoking a pipe.* (AmE)

## *in front of* and *opposite*

Compare:

- *There’s a bus stop **in front of** the school.* (The bus stop is on the same side of the road as the school.)
- *There’s a bus stop **opposite** the school.* (The bus stop is on the other side of the road from the school.)

*In front of* is often the opposite of *behind*.

- *The woman **in front of** me at the ticket window had a complicated problem. I always find myself **behind** people like that.*

## *in front of* and *in the front of*

If you are **in front of** a place, vehicle, etc you are outside it; if you are **in the front of** it you are inside. Compare:

- *We stood **in front of** her car so that she couldn’t drive off.*
- *Her husband was sitting **in the front of** the car. He looked frightened.*

:::note

For the difference between *before* and *in front of*, [(see here)](./before-preposition-and-in-front-of).
