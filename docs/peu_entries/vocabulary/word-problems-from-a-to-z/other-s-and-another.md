# other(s) and another

## *other* and *others*

When *other* is used with a noun it has no plural form.

- *Where are the **other** photos?* (not *~~… the others photos?~~*)

But used alone, without a noun, it can have a plural form.

- *I’ve got one lot of photos. Where are the **others**?*
- *These are too small. Have you got any **others**?*

Normally, *other(s)* is only used alone if it refers to a noun that has been mentioned before. An exception is the common plural use of *(the) others* to mean *(the) other people*.

- *He never thinks of **others**.*
- *Jake’s arrived – I must tell **the others**.*
- but not *~~On the phone, one cannot see the other~~* or *~~He never listens to another~~*

## Not used like an adjective

*Other* is a determiner or pronoun; it is not used exactly like an adjective. So it cannot normally have an adverb before it, or be used after a linking verb.

- *I’d prefer a **completely different** colour.* (not *~~… a completely other colour.~~*)
- *You **look different** with a beard.* (not *~~You look other …~~*)

## ‘additional, extra’

*Another* (spelt as one word) can mean ‘an additional, extra’. It is used with singular countable nouns.

- *Could I have **another piece** of bread?* (not *~~… an other piece of bread.~~*)

*Another* can be used without a noun, or with *one*, if the meaning is clear from what has come before.

- *Those cakes are wonderful. Could I have **another (one)**?*

With uncountable and plural nouns, we normally use *more*, not *other*, with this meaning.

- *Would you like some **more meat**?* (not *~~… other meat?~~*)
- *Would you like some **more peas**?* (not *~~… other peas?~~*)

However, we can use *another* before a plural noun in expressions with *few* or a number.

- *I’m staying for **another few weeks**.*
- *We need **another three chairs**.*

For other cases where *a(n)* is followed by a plural, [(see here)](./../../grammar/nouns-and-noun-phrases-agreement/mixed-singular-and-plural-other-structures#another-aan--adjective).

## ‘alternative’

*(An)other* can also mean ‘(an) alternative’, ‘besides / instead of this/these’.

- *I think we should paint it **another** colour.*
- *Have you got any **other** cakes, or are these the only ones?*

*Other people* often means ‘people besides oneself’.

- *Why don’t you think more about **other people**?*
