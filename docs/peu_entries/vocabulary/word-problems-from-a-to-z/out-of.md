# out of

## Movement

The opposite of the preposition *into* is *out of*.

- *She ran **out of** the room.* (not *~~She ran out the room.~~*) or *~~She ran out from the room.~~*
- *I took Harry’s photo **out of** my pocket.*

*Out of* is also used to mean ‘through’, when we mention the opening through which somebody/something goes out.

- *I walked **out of the front door** without looking back.*
- *Why did you throw the paper **out of the window**?*

In American English, *out* is normally used without *of* in this case.

- *She turned and went **out the back door**.* (AmE)

## Position

*Out of* can also be used to talk about position – the opposite of *in*.

- *I’m afraid Mr Pallery is **out of** the office at the moment.*
