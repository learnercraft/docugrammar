# place: a place to live, etc

In an informal style, *place* can often be followed directly by an infinitive or relative clause, with no preposition or relative word.

- *I’m looking for a **place to live**.* (More formal: *… a place to live in* ``or`` *… a place in which to live*.)
- *There’s no **place to sit down**.*
- *You remember the **place we had lunch**?* (= … *the place (that) we had lunch at?* ``or`` *the place where we had lunch?*)

We do not use *a place where* before an infinitive.

- *I’m looking for **a place (where) I can** wash my clothes. / **a place to** wash my clothes.* (not *~~… a place where to wash my clothes.~~*)

*Go places* (informal) means ‘become very successful in life’.

- *That boy’s going to **go places**, believe me.*
