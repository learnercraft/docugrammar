# point of view

*Point of view* can mean the same as *opinion*.

- *Thank you for giving us your **point of view** / **opinion**.*

But *from somebody’s point of view* is not quite the same *as in somebody’s view/opinion*. It usually means ‘as seen from somebody’s position in life’ (for example as a student, a woman, a Greek or a Catholic), and is used to say how somebody is affected by what happens. Compare:

- ***In my opinion**, war is always wrong.* (= I think war …) (not *~~From my point of view, war is always wrong.~~*)  
  *He wrote about the war **from the point of view of the ordinary soldier**.*
- ***In my view**, it’s a pretty good school.*  
  *You have to judge a school **from the child’s point of view**.*
- ***In Professor Lucas’s opinion**, everybody should work a 20-hour week.*  
  ***From the employers’ point of view**, this would cause a lot of problems.*
