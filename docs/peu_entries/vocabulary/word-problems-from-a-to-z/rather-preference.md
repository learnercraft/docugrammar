# rather: preference

## *rather than*

This expression is normally used in ‘parallel’ structures: for example with two adjectives, adverbs, nouns, infinitives or *\-ing* forms.

- *I’d call her hair **chestnut rather than brown**.*
- *I’d prefer to go **in August rather than in July**.*
- *We ought to invest in **machinery rather than buildings**.*
- *I prefer **starting** early **rather than leaving** things to the last minute.*

When the main clause has a *to*\-infinitive, *rather than* is usually followed by an infinitive without *to* or by an *\-ing* form.

- *I decided **to write rather than phone/phoning**.*
- ***Rather than use/using** the car, I decided **to go** by bike.*

## *would rather*

This expression means ‘would prefer to’, and is followed by the infinitive without *to*. We often use the contraction *’d rather*.

- ***Would** you **rather stay** here or go home?*
- *‘How about a drink?’ ‘I’**d rather have** something to eat.’*

The negative is *would rather not*.

- *I’**d rather not** go out tonight.* (not *~~I wouldn’t rather …~~*)

*Would sooner* is sometimes used in the same way as *would rather*.

Note that *would rather like* (BrE) does not mean ‘would prefer’; in this expression, *rather* means ‘quite’, and does not suggest preference. Compare:

- *‘I’**d rather like** a cup of coffee.’* (= I’d quite like …) *‘Oh, would you? I’**d rather have** a glass of beer.’* (= I’d prefer …)

## *would rather*: past tense with present or future meaning

We can use *would rather* to say that a person would prefer somebody to do something. We use a special structure with a past tense.

:::tip[Grammar]

*would rather* + subject + past tense

:::

- *I’**d rather you went** home now.*
- *Tomorrow’s difficult. I’**d rather you came** next weekend.*
- *My wife **would rather we didn’t see** each other any more.*
- *‘Shall I open a window?’ ‘I’**d rather you didn’t**.’*

A present tense or present subjunctive is possible (e.g. *I’d rather **he goes** / **he go** home now*), but unusual. To talk about past actions, a past perfect tense is possible.

- *I’d rather you **hadn’t done** that.*

However, this kind of idea is usually expressed with *I wish* [(see here)](./wish).

- ***I wish** you hadn’t done that.*

In older English, *had rather* was used in the same way as *would rather*. This structure is still found in grammars, but it is not normally used.

:::note

For other structures where a past tense has a present or future meaning, [(see here)](./../../grammar/past-and-perfect-tenses/past-verb-form-with-present-or-future-meaning).

## *or rather*

People often use *or rather* to correct themselves.

- *He’s a psychologist – **or rather**, a psychoanalyst.* (not *~~… or better, a psychoanalyst.~~*)

## *would rather* and *had better*

Note that *would rather (= would prefer)* is not the same as *had better* (= should, [(see here)](./../../grammar/modal-auxiliary-verbs/weaker-obligation-had-better). Compare:

- *I suppose I’**d better** clean the windows, but I’**d rather** watch TV.*
