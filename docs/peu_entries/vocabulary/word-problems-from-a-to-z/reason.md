# reason

The preposition *for* is used both before and after *reason*.

- *I need to talk to you **for two reasons**.*
- *What’s the real **reason for** your depression?* (not *~~… reason of your depression?~~*)

*Reason* can be followed by a clause beginning *why …* or *that …* .

- *The **reason why** I came here was to be with my family.*
- *Do you know the **reason that** they’re closing the factory?*

In an informal style, *why/that* is often left out.

- *The reason she doesn’t like me is that I make her nervous.*

Some people consider it incorrect to use a *because*\-clause as a complement after *reason* (as in *Sorry I’m late – the reason is because I overslept*).
