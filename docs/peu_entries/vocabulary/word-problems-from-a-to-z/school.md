# school

In British English, *school* is not used for a university or similar institution (though university departments may have the word *School* in their name – e.g. *London School of Economics*). A British institution with *High School* in its name is likely to be a secondary school. In American English, *school* includes university-level institutions. Note also that in Britain, the *public schools* are an elite group of expensive private schools such as Eton College – very different from *state schools*.
