# see

## Progressive forms not used

When *see* means ‘perceive with one’s eyes’, progressive (‘continuous’) forms are not normally used.

- ***Do you see** the woman in blue over there?* (not *~~Are you seeing …?~~*)

To talk about seeing something at the moment of speaking, *can see* is often used, especially in British English [(see here)](./../../grammar/modal-auxiliary-verbs/can-and-could-with-see-hear-etc).

- *I **can see** an aeroplane.* (AmE also *I see an airplane.*) (not *~~I am seeing an aeroplane.~~*)

But we can say that somebody *is seeing things* if we mean that he/she is imagining things that are not there.

- *‘Look! A camel!’ ‘**You’re seeing things**.’*

When *see* means ‘understand’ or ‘have heard’ [(see here)](./hear-see-etc-with-that-clause), progressive forms are not normally used.

- *‘We’ve got a problem.’ ‘**I see**.’*
- *I **see** they’re talking about putting up taxes again.*

## Changes

Progressive forms can be used for changes in people’s ability to see.

- *I’**m seeing** much better since I got those new glasses.*
- *I’**m seeing** a lot of things in this book that I missed when I read it before.*

## ‘meet’, ‘arrange’, etc

When *see* means ‘meet’, ‘interview’, ‘talk to’, ‘go out with’ or ‘arrange’, ‘supervise’, progressive forms are possible.

- *I’**m seeing** the dentist tomorrow.*
- ***Are** you still **seeing** that Henderson woman?*
- *Jack’s down at the docks. He’**s seeing** that our stuff gets loaded correctly.*

## Other meanings: ‘consider’, etc

*See* can mean ‘consider’, ‘think’, ‘find out’, ‘discuss’ or ‘decide’.

- *‘Can I use the car tonight?’ ‘I’**ll see**.’*
- *‘What time do you want to go to the gym?’ ‘Let me **see**. How about five o’clock?’*
- *I’ll call the restaurant and **see** if they’ve got a table free.*

A preposition is necessary before an object in these cases.

- *We’ll **see about that** tomorrow.* (not *~~We’ll see that tomorrow.~~*)
- *You’d better **see about that** with Jim.* (not *~~You’d better see that with Jim.~~*)

*See if … can* often means ‘try to’.

- ***See if** you can get him to stop talking.*
