# sensible and sensitive

A *sensible* person has common sense, and does not make stupid decisions.

- *‘I want to buy that dress.’ ‘Be **sensible**, dear. It’s much too expensive.’*

A *sensitive* person feels things easily or deeply, and may be easily hurt.

- *Don’t shout at her – she’s very **sensitive**.* (not *~~… very sensible.~~*)
- *Have you got a sun cream for **sensitive** skin?* (not *~~… for sensible skin?~~*)

*Sensible* is a ‘false friend’ – similar words in some languages mean ‘sensitive’.
