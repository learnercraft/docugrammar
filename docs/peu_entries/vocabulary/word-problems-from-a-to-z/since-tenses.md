# since: tenses

## Main clause: *I’ve known her since …*

In sentences with *since* (referring to time), we normally use present perfect and past perfect tenses in the main clause.

- *I’**ve known** her since 2005.* (not *~~I know her since …~~*)
- *We **haven’t seen** Jamie since Christmas.*
- *I was sorry when Jacky moved to America; we **had been** good friends since university days.*

However, present and past tenses are also occasionally found, especially in sentences about changes.

- *You’**re looking** much better since your operation.*
- *She **doesn’t come** round to see us so much **since** her marriage.*
- *Since last Sunday I **can’t stop** thinking about you.*
- *Things **weren’t going** so well since Father’s illness.*

## *It’s a long time since …*

In British English, present and past tenses are common in the structure *It is*/*was … since …*

- ***It’s** a long time **since** the last meeting.*
- ***It was** ages **since** that wonderful trip.*

American English prefers perfect tenses in this structure.

- ***It’s been** a long time **since** the last meeting.*
- ***It had been** ages **since** that wonderful trip.*

## *since*-clause: *since we were at school*

*Since* can be used as a conjunction of time, introducing its own clause. The tense in the *since*\-clause can be perfect or past, depending on the meaning. Compare:

- *I’ve known her **since we were at school together**.*  
  *I’ve known her **since I’ve lived in this street**.*
- *You’ve drunk about ten cups of tea **since you arrived**.*  
  *You’ve drunk about ten cups of tea **since you’ve been sitting here**.*
- *We visit my parents every week **since we bought the car**.*  
  *We visit my parents every week **since we’ve had the car**.*
