# so (conjunction) and then

*So* and *then* can both be used in replies, to mean ‘since that is so’, ‘it follows from what you have said’.

- *‘It’s more expensive to travel on Friday.’ ‘**Then**/**So** I’ll leave on Thursday.’*
- *‘I’ll be needing the car.’ ‘**Then**/**So** I suppose I’ll have to take a taxi.’*

*So* (but not *then*) can also be used when the same speaker connects two ideas, to mean ‘it follows from what I have said’.

- *It’s more expensive to travel on Friday, **so** I’ll leave on Thursday.* (not *~~… Then I’ll leave on Thursday.~~*)
