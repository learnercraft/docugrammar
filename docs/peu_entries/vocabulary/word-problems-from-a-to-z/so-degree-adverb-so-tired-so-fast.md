# so (degree adverb): so tired, so fast

## Meaning

*So* means ‘that much’ or ‘to that extent’. It is used when we are talking about a high degree of some quality – in situations where *very* is also a suitable word.

- *I’m sorry you’re **so** tired.* (= I know you’re very tired, and I’m sorry.)
- *It was **so** cold that we couldn’t go out.* (= It was very cold weather, and because of that we couldn’t go out.)
- *I wish she didn’t drive **so** fast.*

## *so* and *very*

*Very* [(see here)](./very-and-very-much) is used when we are giving new information. *So* is mainly used to refer to information which has already been given, which is already known, or which is obvious. Compare:

- *You’re **very** late.* (giving new information)  
  *I’m sorry I’m **so** late.* (referring to information which is already known)
- *It was **very** warm in Scotland.* (giving new information)  
  *I didn’t think it would be **so** warm.* (referring to information which is already known)

## Emphatic use

In an informal style, *so* can also be used like *very* to give new information, when the speaker wishes to emphasise what is said. This structure is rather like an exclamation [(see here)](./../../grammar/basic-clause-types/exclamations).

- *He’s **so** bad-tempered!* (= How bad-tempered he is!)
- *You’re **so** right!*

## *so … that*

We use *so*, not *very*, before *that*\-clauses.

- *It was **so** cold **that** we stopped playing.* (not *~~It was very cold that we stopped playing.~~*)
- *He spoke **so** fast **that** nobody could understand.* (not *~~He spoke very fast that …~~*)

## Before adjectives and adverbs

We can use *so* before an adjective alone (without a noun) or an adverb.

- *The milk was **so good** that we couldn’t stop drinking it.*
- *Why are you driving **so fast**?*

*So* is not used with adjective + noun.

- *I didn’t expect **such terrible weather**.* (not *~~… so terrible weather.~~*)
- *I enjoyed my stay in your country, which is **so beautiful**.* (not *~~I enjoyed my stay in your so beautiful country.~~*)

:::note

For *such*, [(see here)](./such-and-so).

:::

## *so much*, etc

We can use *so much* and *so many* [(see here)](./so-much-and-so-many), *so few* and *so little* with or without nouns.

- *I’ve bought **so many** new books; I don’t know when I’ll read them.*
- *There were **so few** interesting people there that we decided to go home.*
- *I’ve read **so much** and learnt **so little**.*

## *so* and *so much*

We use *so*, not *so much*, before adjectives without nouns [(see here)](./so-degree-adverb-so-tired-so-fast#before-adjectives-and-adverbs) above). Compare:

- *She had **so much heavy luggage** that she couldn’t carry it.*  
  *Her luggage was **so heavy** that she couldn’t carry it.* (not *~~Her luggage was so much heavy …~~*)
- *I’ve never seen **so much beautiful jewellery**.*  
  *The jewellery is **so beautiful**!* (not *~~… so much beautiful!~~*)

But we use *so much*, not *so*, before comparatives.

- *I’m glad you’re feeling **so much better**.* (not *~~… so better.~~*)

## *so … as to …*

There is a structure with *so* followed by adjective + *as to* + infinitive. This is formal and not very common.

- *Would you be **so kind as to tell** me the time?* (= … kind enough to …) (not *~~Would you be so kind and …~~*) or *~~Would you be so kind to …~~*

## *so … a …*

There is another rather formal structure with *so* + adjective + *a*/*an* + noun [(see here)](./../../grammar/adjectives/adjectives-position-after-as-how-so-too).

- *I had never before met **so gentle a person**.* (= … such a gentle person.)
