# so that and in order that

## Purpose

These structures are used to talk about purpose. *So that* is more common than *in order that*, especially in an informal style. They are often followed by auxiliary verbs such as *can* or *will*; *may* is more formal.

- *She’s staying here for six months **so that** she **can** perfect her English.*
- *I’m putting it in the oven now **so that** it’**ll** be ready by seven o’clock.*
- *We send monthly reports **in order that** they **may** have full information.*

In an informal style, *that* can be dropped after *so* [(see here)](./../../grammar/noun-clauses-direct-and-indirect-speech/leaving-out-that).

- *I’ve come early **so** I can talk to you.*

## Present tenses for future

Present tenses are sometimes used for the future.

- *I’ll send the contract express **so that** she **gets** / she’ll get it before Tuesday.*
- *I’m going to make an early start **so that** I **don’t**/won’t get stuck in the traffic.*
- *We must write to him, **in order that** he **does**/will not feel that we are hiding things.*

## Past structures

In sentences about the past, *would*, *could* or *should* are generally used with verbs after *so that* / *in order that*. *Might* is possible in a very formal style.

- *Emily talked to the shy girl **so that** she **wouldn’t** feel left out.*
- *I took my golf clubs **so that** I **could** play on Sunday.*
- *They met on a Saturday **in order that** everybody **should** be free to attend.*
- *He built a chain of castles **so that** he **might** control the whole country.*
