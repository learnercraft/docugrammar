# so with say and tell

## Instead of *that*-clauses

*So* can be used after *say* and *tell* instead of repeating information in a *that*\-clause.

- *She’s going to be the next president. Everybody **says so**.* (= … Everybody says that she’s going to be the next president.)
- *‘You’ve got to clean the car.’ ‘Who **says so**?’*
- *Taxes are going up. Joseph **told** me **so**.*

Note that *so* is used in this way mostly when we are talking about the authority for statements, about reasons why we should believe them. When we simply want to identify the speaker, we prefer *that*. Compare:

- *‘Megan’s crazy.’ ‘Who says **so**?’ ‘Dr Bannister.’*
- *‘Megan’s crazy.’ ‘Who said **that**?’ ‘I did.’*

## *I told you so.*

*I told you so* usually means ‘I warned you, but you wouldn’t listen to me’.

- *‘Mummy, I’ve broken my train.’ ‘**I told you so**. You shouldn’t have tried to ride on it.’*

## Other verbs

*So* cannot be used after all verbs of saying. We cannot say, for example, **~~She promised me so.~~**
