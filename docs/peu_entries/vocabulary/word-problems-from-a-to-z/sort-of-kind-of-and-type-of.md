# sort of, kind of and type of

## Articles

The article *a*/*an* is usually dropped after *sort of*, *kind of* and *type of*, but structures with articles are possible in an informal style.

- *That’s a funny **sort of (a)** car.*
- *What **sort of (a)** bird is that?*

## Singular and plural; *these sort of*, etc

When we are talking about one sort of thing, we can use *sort of*, *kind of* or *type of* followed by a singular noun.

- *This **sort of car** is enormously expensive to run.*
- *I’m interested in any new **type of development** in computer science.*

Singular *sort of*, *kind of* and *type of* can also be followed by plural nouns, especially in an informal style.

- *I’m interested in any new **kind of developments** …*

Plural demonstratives (*these* and *those*) can also be used.

- ***These sort of cars** are enormously expensive to run.*
- *Do you smoke **those kind of cigarettes**?*

This structure (*these sort of*, etc) is often felt to be incorrect, and is usually avoided in a formal style. This can be done by using a singular noun (see above), by using plural *sorts*/*kinds*/*types*, or by using the structure *… of this*/*that sort*/*kind*/*type*.

- ***This sort of** car is …*
- ***These kinds of** car(s) are …*
- *Cars **of that type** are …*

## Softeners

In an informal style, *sort of* and *kind of* can be used before almost any word or expression, or at the end of a sentence, to show that we are not speaking very exactly, or to make what we say less definite.

- *We **sort of thought** you might forget.*
- *Sometimes I **sort of wonder** whether I shouldn’t **sort of get** a job.*
- *I’ve had **sort of an idea** about what we could do.*
- *She’s **kind of strange**.*
- *I’ve changed my mind, **kind of**.*
