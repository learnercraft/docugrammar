# suppose, supposing and what if

*Suppose*, *supposing* and *what if* can all be used with present tenses to make suggestions about things that might happen.

- *‘I haven’t got a tablecloth.’ ‘**Suppose** we **use** a sheet.’*
- *‘Let’s go to the beach.’ ‘**Supposing** it **rains**.’*
- ***What** if we **invite** your mother next weekend and go away the week after?*

A past tense makes the suggestion sound less definite.

- *‘Daddy, can I watch TV?’ ‘**Suppose** you **did** your homework first.’*
- *‘I’m going to climb up there.’ ‘No! **supposing** you **slipped**!’*
- ***What if** I **came** tomorrow instead of this afternoon?*

In sentences about the past, past perfect tenses are used to talk about situations that did not occur.

- *That was very clever, but **supposing** you **had slipped**?*
