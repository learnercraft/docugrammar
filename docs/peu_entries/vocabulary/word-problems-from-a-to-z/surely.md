# surely

*Surely* is more common in British than American English.

## Not the same as *certainly*

*Surely* does not usually mean the same as *certainly*. We use *certainly* when we simply tell people that something is true. We use *surely* mostly to ask for people’s agreement: to persuade them that something must be true, or that there are good reasons for believing it. Compare:

- *House prices are **certainly** rising fast at the moment.* (‘I know this is so.’)  
  *House prices will **surely** stop rising soon.* (‘I believe this must be so.’)
- *I **certainly** transferred the money on Monday.* (‘I know.’)  
  *She’s **surely** got the money by now.* (‘It seems very probable.’)

## Belief in spite of …

*Surely* can be used when we say that we think something is true in spite of reasons to believe the opposite, or in spite of suggestions to the contrary. These sentences are often like questions.

- *‘I’m going to marry Sonia.’ ‘**Surely** she’s married already?’*
- ***Surely** that’s Henry over there? I thought he was in Scotland.*
- *‘Is it tonight we’re going out?’ ‘No, tomorrow, **surely**?’*

With *not*, *surely* can express difficulty in believing something.

- *‘Tim failed his exam.’ ‘Oh, **surely not**?’*
- ***Surely** you’re **not** going out in that hat?*
- *You do**n’t** think I’m going to pay for you, **surely**?*
