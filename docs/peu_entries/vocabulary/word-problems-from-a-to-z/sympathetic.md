# sympathetic

*Sympathetic* usually means ‘sharing somebody’s feelings’ or ‘sorry for somebody who is in trouble’.

- *I’m **sympathetic** towards the strikers.*
- *She’s always very **sympathetic** when people feel ill.*

*Sympathetic* is a ‘false friend’ for speakers of certain languages. It does not usually mean the same as, for example, *sympatyczny*, *sympathisch*, *sympatisk* or *simpático*.

- *The people in my class are all very **nice** / **pleasant** / **easy to get along with**.* (not *~~… are all very sympathetic.~~*)
