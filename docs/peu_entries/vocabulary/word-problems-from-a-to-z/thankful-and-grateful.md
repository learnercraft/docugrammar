# thankful and grateful

*Grateful* is the normal word for people’s reactions to kindness, favours, etc.

- *I’m very **grateful** for all your help.* (not *~~I’m very thankful …~~*)
- *She wasn’t a bit **grateful** to me for repairing her car.*

*Thankful* is used especially for feelings of relief at having avoided a danger, or at having come through an unpleasant experience.

- *I’m **thankful** that we got home before the storm started.*
- *We feel very **thankful** that she didn’t marry him after all.*
- *Well, I’m **thankful** that’s over.*
