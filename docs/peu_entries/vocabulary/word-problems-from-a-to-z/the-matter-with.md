# the matter (with)

We use *the matter (with)* after *something*, *anything*, *nothing* and *what*. It means ‘wrong (with)’.

- *Something’s **the matter with** my foot.*
- *Is anything **the matter**?*
- *Nothing’s **the matter with** the car – you’re just a bad driver.*
- *What’s **the matter with** Frank today?*

*There* is often used as a ‘preparatory subject’ [(see here)](./../../grammar/be-have-and-do/there-is).

- ***There’**s something **the matter with** the TV.*
- *Is **there** anything **the matter**?*

:::note

For *no matter what*, etc, [(see here)](./../../grammar/other-adverbial-clauses/no-matter-who-etc).
