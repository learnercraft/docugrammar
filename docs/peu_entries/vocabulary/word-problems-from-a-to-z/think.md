# think

## ‘have an opinion’: not progressive

When *think* is used for opinions, progressive forms are unusual.

- *I **don’t think** much of his latest book.* (not *~~I’m not thinking much…~~*)
- *Who **do** you **think** will win the election?* (not *~~Who are you thinking …?~~*)

## Other meanings: progressive possible

When *think* has other meanings (e.g. *consider* or *plan*) progressives are possible.

- *You’re looking worried. What **are** you **thinking** about?* (not *~~… What do you think about?~~*)
- *I’**m thinking** of changing my job.*

## *-ing* forms

After *think*, *\-ing* forms can be used, but infinitives are not usually possible unless there is an object [(see here)](./think#think-object-to-be-complement) below).

- *She’s **thinking of going** to Brazil next year.* (not *~~She’s thinking to go …~~*)

However, *think* + infinitive can be used when we talk about remembering to do something, or having the good sense to do something.

- *Did you **think to close** the windows when it started raining?*

## *think* + object (+ *to be*) + complement

In a very formal style, *think* is sometimes followed by an object and an adjective or noun complement.

- *They **thought her fascinating**.*
- *We **thought him a fool**.*

*It* can be used as a preparatory object [(see here)](./../../grammar/information-structure/preparatory-it-object) for an infinitive or clause.

- *I thought **it** better **to pretend that I knew nothing**.*
- *We thought **it** important **that she should go home**.*

*To be* is occasionally used before the complement (suggesting objective judgement rather than subjective impression), but this is very unusual.

- *They thought him **to be** a spy.*

In more normal styles, *that*\-clauses are preferred after *think*.

- *They **thought that** she was fascinating.*
- *We **thought that** he was a fool.*

However, the passive equivalent of the object + complement structure is reasonably common, usually with *to be*.

- *He **was thought to be** a spy.*

## Transferred negation: *I don’t think …*

When *think* is used to introduce a negative clause, we most often put *not* with *think*, rather than with the following clause [(see here)](./../../grammar/basic-clause-types/negative-structures-with-think-hope-seem-etc).

- *I **don’t think** it will rain.* (More natural than *I think it won’t rain.*)
- *Emily **doesn’t think** she can come.*

However, we can express surprise with *I thought … not*.

- *Hello! I **thought** you **weren’t** coming!*

## Indirect speech

*Think* does not usually introduce indirect questions.

- *I **was wondering** if I could do anything to help.* (More natural than *I was thinking if …*)

## *I thought …*

Note the use of stressed *I thought …* to suggest that the speaker was right. Compare:

- *‘It isn’t very nice.’ ‘Oh, dear. I thought you’d **``LIKE``** it. (But I was wrong.)’*
- *‘It’s beautiful!’ ‘Oh, I am glad. I **``THOUGHT``** you’d like it. (And I was right.)’*

## *I had thought …*, *I should think*, etc

Past perfect forms can suggest that the speaker was mistaken, especially when *had* is stressed.

- *I **had thought** that we were going to be invited to dinner.*

*I should think* and *I should have thought* (also *I would* / *I’d …*) are used (mostly in British English) to introduce guesses.

- ***I should think** we’ll need at least twelve bottles of wine.*
- ***I’d have thought** we could expect at least forty people.*

This structure can also introduce criticisms.

- ***I should have thought** he could have washed his hands, at least.*
