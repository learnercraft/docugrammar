# through: time

In American English, *through* can be used to mean ‘up to and including’.

- *The park is open from May **through** September.*

In British English, *through* is not normally used in this way. Instead, British people say, for example, **to … inclusive**, or **until the end of …**

- *The park is open from May **to** September **inclusive**.* (or *… from May **until the end of** September.*)
