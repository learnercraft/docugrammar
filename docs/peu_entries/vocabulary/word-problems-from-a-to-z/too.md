# too

## *too* and *very*

*Too* is different from *very* – *too* means ‘more than enough’, ‘more than necessary’ or ‘more than is wanted’. Compare:

- *He’s a **very** intelligent child.*  
  *He’s **too** intelligent for his class – he’s not learning anything.*
- *It was **very** cold, but we went out.*  
  *It was **too** cold to go out, so we stayed at home.*

## *too* and *too much*

Before adjectives without nouns and before adverbs we use *too*, not *too much*.

- *You’re **too kind** to me.* (not *~~You’re too much kind to me.~~*)
- *I arrived **too early**.* (not *~~I arrived too much early.~~*)

*Too much* is used, for example, before nouns. For details, [(see here)](./too-much-and-too-many).

- *I’ve got **too much work**.*

## Modification: *much too*, *far too*, etc

Expressions which modify comparatives [(see here)](./../../grammar/comparison/much-older-by-far-the-oldest-etc) also modify *too*.

- ***much** too old* (not *~~very too old~~*)
- ***a lot** too big*
- ***far** too young*
- ***a little** too confident*
- ***a bit** too soon*
- ***rather** too often*

## Not used before adjective + noun

*Too* is not normally used before adjective + noun.

- *I put down the bag because it was too heavy.* (not *~~… the too heavy bag.~~*)
- *She doesn’t like men who are too tall.* (not *~~She doesn’t like too tall men.~~*)
- *Let’s forget this problem – it’s too difficult.* (not *~~… this too difficult problem.~~*)

In a rather formal style, *too* can be used before adjective + *a*/*an* + noun [(see here)](./../../grammar/adjectives/adjectives-position-after-as-how-so-too). Note the word order.

- *It’s **too cold a day** for tennis.*

## *too …* + infinitive

We can use an infinitive structure after *too* + adjective/adverb.

- *He’s **too old to work**.*
- *It’s far **too cold to go** out.*

We can also use an infinitive structure after *too much*/*many*.

- *There was **too much snow to go** walking.*

If the infinitive has its own subject, this is introduced by *for* [(see here)](./../../grammar/infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-other-uses/for-to).

- *It’s too late **for the pubs** to be open.*
- *There was too much snow **for us** to go walking.*

## *too salty to drink*, etc

The subject of a sentence with *too* can also be the object of a following infinitive. (For more about this structure, [(see here)](./../../grammar/infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/infinitives-after-adjectives-pleased-to-see-you#easy-to-please). Object pronouns are not normally used after the infinitive in this case.

- *The water is too salty to drink.* (not *~~The water is too salty to drink it.~~*)

However, object pronouns are possible in structures with *for*.

- *The water is too salty **for us** to drink **(it)**.*

Note the two possible meanings of sentences like *He’s too stupid to teach*:

1\. *He’s too stupid to be a teacher.*

2\. *He’s too stupid for anyone to teach – he can’t be taught.*

## *That’s really too kind of you.*

In informal speech *too* can sometimes be used to mean ‘very’.

- *Oh, that’s really **too** kind of you – thank you so much.*
- *I’m not feeling **too** well.*

## *only too …*

The expression *only too* is used to mean ‘very’, ‘extremely’. It is common in formal offers and invitations.

- *We will be **only too** pleased if you can spend a few days with us.*

:::note

For *too* meaning ‘also’, [(see here)](./also-as-well-and-too).
