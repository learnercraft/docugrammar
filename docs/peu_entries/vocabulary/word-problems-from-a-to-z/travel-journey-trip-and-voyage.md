# travel, journey, trip and voyage

*Travel* means ‘travelling in general’. It is normally uncountable.

- *My interests are music and **travel**.*

The plural *travels* is sometimes used; it suggests a rather grand programme of travelling or exploration.

- *He wrote a wonderful book about his **travels** in the Himalayas.*

A *journey* (more common in British English) is one ‘piece’ of travelling.

- *Did you have a good **journey**?* (not *~~Did you have a good travel?~~*)
- *I met Megan on my last **journey** to England.* (not *~~… my last travel.~~*)

A *trip* is a return journey together with the activity (business or pleasure) which is the reason for the journey.

- *I’m going on a business **trip** next week.* (= I’m going on a journey and I’m going to do some business.)
- *Daniel’s school is organising a skiing **trip** to the Alps.*

Compare:

- *‘How was your **journey**?’ ‘The train broke down.’*
- *‘How was your **trip**?’ ‘Successful.’*

We do not so often use *trip* for expeditions which have a very serious purpose, are very hard and/or take a very long time.

- *In 1863 the President **travelled** to Dakota to make peace with the Indians.* (not *~~… made a trip to Dakota to make peace …~~*)
- *Amundsen made his **journey** to the South Pole in 1911.* (not *~~Amundsen made his trip to the South Pole …~~*)

A long sea journey is often called a *voyage*.

Note the preposition: ***on*** *a journey*/*trip*/*voyage*.
