# up, down

## ‘towards/away from the centre’

*Up* and *down* are not only used to refer to higher and lower positions. They can also refer to more or less important or central places. (Trains to London used to be called ‘up trains’, and trains from London ‘down trains’.)

- *The ambassador walked slowly **up** the room towards the Queen’s throne.*
- *She ran **down** the passage, out of the front door and **down** the garden.*
- *We’ll be going **down** to the country for the weekend.*

But in the US *downtown* refers to the central business/entertainment area.

## North and south

People often use *up* and *down* for movements towards the north and south (perhaps because north is at the top of a map page).

- *I work in London, but I have to travel **up** to Glasgow every few weeks.*

## ‘along’

Sometimes both *up* and *down* are used to mean ‘along’, ‘further on’, with little or no difference of meaning.

- *The nearest bank is about half a mile **up**/**down** the road.*
