# very and very much

## Adjectives and adverbs: *very kind*, *very quickly*

We use *very*, not *very much*, before adjectives and adverbs.

- *You’re **very** kind.* (not *~~You’re very much kind.~~*)
- *The situation is **very** serious.* (not *~~… very much serious.~~*)
- *I came **very** quickly.* (not *~~… very much quickly.~~*)

However, *(very) much* is used before comparatives.

- *I’m **(very) much happier** in my new job.* (not *~~… very happier …~~*)

:::note

For *very* with superlatives (*very first*, *very best*, etc), [(see here)](./../../grammar/comparison/much-older-by-far-the-oldest-etc#very-with-superlatives).

For *the very same*, [(see here)](./the-same).

:::

## *not very*

*Not very* expresses quite a low degree.

- *It’s **not very** warm – you’d better take a coat.*
- *That meal was**n’t very** expensive.* (= quite cheap.)

Note that *little* cannot be used in this way.

- *He’s **not very** imaginative.* (not *~~He’s little imaginative.~~*)

## Past participles: *very much loved*, *very worried*

Before past participles we normally use *very much*.

- *She was **very much loved** by her grandchildren.* (not *~~She was very loved.~~*)
- *Journey times will be **very much reduced** by the new road.* (not *~~… very reduced …~~*)

But we use *very* with some past participles that are used as adjectives. For details, [(see here)](./../../grammar/infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles/participles-ing-and-ed-forms-used-like-adjectives#much-admired-very-frightened).

- *I’m **very worried** about Angela.* (not *~~… very much worried …~~*)
- *We were **very surprised** when Dan passed his exam.* (More common than … *very much surprised* …)

## *very much* (adverbial)

*Very much* can be an adverbial.

- *We **very much** enjoyed the party.* (not *~~We very enjoyed …~~*)

We do not normally put *very much* between a verb and its object.

- *I **very much** like mountains.* (not *~~I like very much mountains.~~*)

*Very much* can also be a determiner before a noun.

- *She didn’t have **very much money**.*
- *Have you got **very much work** to do?*

*Very much* is not often used as a determiner in affirmative clauses [(see here)](./../../grammar/determiners-quantifiers/much-and-many#not-used-in-affirmative-clauses).

- *There was **a lot of snow** on the road.* (not *~~There was very much snow …~~*)

:::note

For *very … indeed*, [(see here)](./indeed).
