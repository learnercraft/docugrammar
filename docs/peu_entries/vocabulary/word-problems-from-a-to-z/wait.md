# wait

*Wait* can be followed by an infinitive.

- *I’ll **wait to hear** from you before I do anything.*

Before a direct object, *wait for* is used.

- *Please **wait for me** here.* (not *~~Please wait me here.~~*)

*That*\-clauses are not used, but an object + infinitive structure is possible.

- *We’ll have to wait **for the photos to be** ready.* (not *~~… wait that the photos are ready.~~*)

The time preposition *for* is often dropped after *wait*.

- *I **waited (for)** a very long time for her answer.*

The transitive verb *await* is formal, and is used mostly with abstract objects.

- *We’re still **awaiting instructions**.*
