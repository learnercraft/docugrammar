# want

## Infinitive with *to*

After *want*, we normally use an infinitive with *to*.

- *I don’t **want to come** back here ever again.* (not *~~I don’t want come back …~~*)

*That*\-clauses are not normally used after *want*, but an object + infinitive structure [(see here)](./../../grammar/infinitives-ing-forms-and-past-participles-after-nouns-verbs-etc/verb-object-infinitive-i-want-you-to-listen) is possible.

- *Do you **want me to make** you some coffee?* (not *~~Do you want (that) I make you some coffee?~~*)
- *I don’t **want that woman to come** here.*

In American English, a structure with *for* + object + infinitive is also possible.

- *Do you want **for me to make** you some coffee?*

## Structure with object complement

*Want* can be followed by an object together with a complement (adjective, adverbial or past participle) to express ideas such as change or result.

- *She doesn’t want **him back**.*
- *We want **the job finished** by Tuesday.*
- *They wanted **him dead**.*
- *I want **her out** of there now.*

*To be* or *as* is used before a noun complement.

- *I want you **to be my friend**.* (or … **as my friend**.) (not *~~I want you my friend.~~*)

## *want* meaning ‘need’

In informal British English, we can say that a thing ‘wants’ (= needs) something, particularly with reference to actions.

- ***That car wants** a clean.*
- ***Your hair wants** a good brush.*

In this case, *want* can be followed by an *\-ing* form (like *need*, [(see here)](./need).

- *This coat **wants cleaning**.* (= … needs to be cleaned.)

## I wanna hold your hand

In informal speech, *want to* often sounds like ‘wanna’. It is sometimes spelt like this in order to represent conversational pronunciation – for example in comic strips.

:::note

For *to* used instead of a whole infinitive (e.g. *I don’t want to, thanks*), [(see here)](./../../grammar/information-structure/ellipsis-infinitives).

For *want* and *will*, [(see here)](./will-and-want).
