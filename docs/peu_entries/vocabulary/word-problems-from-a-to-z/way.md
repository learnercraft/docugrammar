# way

## Preposition dropped

In an informal style, we usually drop the prepositions *in* or *by* before *way*.

- *You’re doing it **(in) the wrong way**.*
- *Do it **(in) any way** you like.*
- *Come **this way**.*
- *We went there **the usual way**.*

## Relative structures

In an informal style, we often say *the way (that)* instead of *the way in*/*by which*.

- *I don’t like **the way (that)** you talk to me.*
- *Let’s go **the way (that)** we went yesterday.*

## Infinitive or *-ing*

After *way* (meaning ‘method’/‘manner’) we can use an infinitive structure or *of …ing*. There is no important difference between the two structures.

- *There’s no **way to prove** / **of proving** that he was stealing.*

## *way of* and *means of*

*Way of* is unusual before a noun (except in the common expression *way of life*). We use *means of* or *method of* instead.

- *The 19th century saw a revolution in **means of transport**.* (not *~~… ways of transport.~~*)
- *They tried all possible **methods of instruction**, but the child learnt nothing.*

## *in the way* and *on the way*

These expressions are quite different. *In the*/*my*, etc *way* is used for obstacles – things that stop people getting where they want to.

- *I can’t get the car out because those boxes are **in the way**.*
- *Please don’t stand in the doorway – you’re **in my way**.*

*On the*/*my*, etc *way* means ‘during the journey/movement’ or ‘coming’.

- *We’ll have lunch **on our way**.*
- *Spring is **on the way**.*
