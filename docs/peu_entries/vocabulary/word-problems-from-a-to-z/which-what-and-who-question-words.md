# which, what and who: question words

## *which* and *what*: the difference

*Which* and *what* are often both possible, with little difference of meaning.

- ***Which**/**What** is the hottest city in the world?*
- ***Which**/**What** train did you come on?*
- ***Which**/**What** people have influenced you most in your life?*

We prefer *which* when we have a limited number of choices in mind.

- *We’ve got white or brown bread. **Which** will you have?* (More natural than *… What will you have?*)
- ***Which** size do you want – small, medium or large?*

When we are not thinking of a limited number of choices, *what* is preferred.

- ***What** language do they speak in Greenland?* (More natural than *Which language …*)
- ***What’**s your phone number?* (not *~~Which is your phone number?~~*)

## Determiners: *which* and *what*

Before nouns, *which* and *what* can be used to ask questions about both things and people.

- ***Which** teacher do you like best?*
- ***Which** colour do you want – green, red, yellow or brown?*
- ***What** writers do you like?*
- ***What** colour are your baby’s eyes?*

## *which of*

Before another determiner (e.g. *the*, *my*, *these*) or a pronoun, we use *which of*. *Who* and *what* are not normally used with *of* like this in modern English.

- ***Which of your** teachers do you like best?* (not *~~Who/What of your teachers …~~*)
- ***Which of us** is going to do the cooking?* (not *~~Who of us …?~~*)
- ***Which of these** coats is yours?* (not *~~What of these …?~~*)

## Without nouns: *who* for people

When these words are not followed by nouns or pronouns, we generally use *who*, not *which*, for people.

- ***Who** won – Smith or Fitzgibbon?* (not *~~Which won …?~~*)
- ***Who** are you going out with – Lesley or Maria?*

However, *which* can be used in questions about people’s identity, and *what* can be used to ask about people’s jobs and functions.

- *‘**Which** is your husband?’ ‘The one in jeans.’*
- *So Jessica’s the Managing Director. **What’**s Daniel?*
