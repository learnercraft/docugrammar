# whose and who’s

*Whose* is a possessive word meaning ‘of whom/which’, used in questions and relative clauses. *Who’s* is the contraction of *who is* or *who has*. Compare:

- ***Whose** is that coat?* (not *~~Who’s is that coat?~~*)  
  *It was a decision **whose** importance was not realised at the time.* (not *~~… who’s importance …~~*)
- *Do you know anybody **who’s** going to Poland in the next few days?* (not *~~… anybody whose going …~~*)  
  *I’ve got a cousin **who’s** never been to London.* (not *~~… whose never been …~~*)

There is a similar confusion between *its* and *it’s*: [(see here)](./its-and-it-s).
