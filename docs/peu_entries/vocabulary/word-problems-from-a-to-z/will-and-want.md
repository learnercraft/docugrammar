# *will* and *want*

*Will* and *want* can both be used to talk about wishes, but they are rather different. *Will* is used mostly in ‘interpersonal’ ways, to express wishes that affect other people through orders, requests, offers, promises, etc. *Want* simply refers to people’s wishes – nothing more. *Will* is to do with actions, *want* is to do with thoughts. Compare:

- ***Will** you open the window?* (an order)  
  *Do you **want** to open the window?* (a question about somebody’s wishes)
- *She **won’t** tell anybody.* (= She refuses to …)  
  *She **doesn’t want** to tell anybody.* (= She prefers not to …)

Note that *will* cannot be used with a direct object.

- ***Do you want** / **Would you like** an aspirin?* (not *~~Will you an aspirin?~~*)
