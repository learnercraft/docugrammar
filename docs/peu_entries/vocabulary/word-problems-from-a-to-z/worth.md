# worth

## *worth a lot*, etc

*Worth* can be followed by an expression describing the value of something.

- *That piano must be **worth a lot**.*
- *I don’t think their pizzas are **worth the money**.*
- *‘Shall I talk to Rob?’ ‘It’s not **worth the trouble**.’*

In questions about value, either *what* or *how much* can be used.

- ***What** / **How much** is that painting worth?*

## *a million dollars’ worth of …*

A possessive can be used before *worth* in expressions with numbers.

- *They’ve ordered **a million dollars’ worth** of computer software.*

## *It’s worth talking to Joe*; *Joe’s worth talking to*

To talk about the value of an activity, we can use an *\-ing* form with *worth*. The *\-ing* clause cannot be the subject; we often use preparatory *it*.

- ***It’s worth talking** to Joe.* (not *~~Talking to Joe is worth.~~*)
- ***It isn’t worth repairing** the car.*
- ***Is it worth visiting** Leicester?*

We can also use a structure in which the object of the *\-ing* form (*Joe*, *the car*, *Leicester*) is made the subject of the sentence.

- ***Joe’**s worth talking to.*
- ***The car** isn’t worth repairing.* (not *~~The car isn’t worth repairing it.~~*) or *~~The car isn’t worth to be repaired.~~*
- *Is **Leicester** worth visiting?*

## *It’s worth it.*

We often use *It’s (not) worth it* to say whether something is worth doing.

- *If you pay a bit more you get a room to yourself. I think **it’s worth it**.*
- *‘Should we go and see the castle?’ ‘No, **it’s not worth it**.’*

## *worthwhile*

*Worthwhile* (or *worth while*) is sometimes used instead of *worth*, particularly to express the idea ‘worth spending time’.

- *Is it **worthwhile** visiting Leicester?*

Infinitives are also possible after *worthwhile*.

- *We thought it might be **worthwhile to compare** the two years’ accounts.*

Note also the structure *worth somebody’s while*.

- *Would you like to do some gardening for me? I’ll make it **worth your while**.* (= … I’ll pay you enough.)

## *well worth*

*Worth* can be modified by *well*.

- *Leicester’s **well worth** visiting.* (not *~~… very worth …~~*)
